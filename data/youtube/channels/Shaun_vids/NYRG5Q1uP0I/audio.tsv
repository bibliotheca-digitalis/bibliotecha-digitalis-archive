0	13000	Hello and welcome everyone. It's time. It happens every year and we're here. It is Eurovision time. We're here for the semi-finals, the live official stream.
13000	19000	We're down to our final three competitors here. Representing Bosnia, Herzegovina. We've got Brad.
19000	22000	Hi. What's going on?
22000	24000	Representing Wales, we've got Drew.
24000	28000	Hi. Thanks. It's great to be here representing the country of Wales.
28000	32000	Yeah. And representing Tulsa, Oklahoma, we've got Dan.
32000	37000	Jeff, you're horribly mistaken. I like the enthusiasm. Let's carry that through to what we're actually doing.
37000	39000	You want to tell the people what we're doing, Jeff?
39000	41000	Eurovision is happening.
41000	43000	No, no, no. Jeff, you were wrong.
43000	46000	No live animals allowed on the stage.
46000	48000	I just saw Kachida Worst right over there.
48000	50000	There is a microphone here.
50000	55000	Yep. You guys are going to perform your songs for your given nation states?
55000	57000	There might be singing. I don't know.
57000	65000	And we are going to choose who moves on to the finals. It's a very exciting time. Of course, the finals are happening this weekend.
65000	67000	There will be a winner.
67000	69000	Yeah, there will, absolutely.
69000	70000	It is a competition.
70000	75000	The winner of Eurovision. And the voting is just a great time of year.
75000	78000	So we're watching the replay of the semi-finals. Is that what's happening here?
78000	83000	Semi-finals part two. We're going to get into this whole stuff here.
84000	86000	We just need to switch the TVs.
86000	90000	No, no. They got it on the right thing. This is the right audio here.
90000	92000	Is this one of the songs?
92000	93000	Yeah, Jason.
93000	94000	Which song is this?
94000	95000	Italy?
95000	96000	This is Italy's?
96000	99000	This is the story of Brighton and Twyla.
99000	102000	This is not a trophy-winning composition from what I'm hearing.
104000	106000	It's nice just to be nominated.
106000	107000	That's nice.
107000	108000	Laughter.
108000	111000	Giving my ten points to getting up and walking out of this room right now.
111000	112000	Oh, you can't.
113000	116000	What is the record here? I believe it's Brad has...
116000	117000	Zero.
117000	118000	One.
118000	119000	Drew has zero.
119000	120000	Dan has zero.
120000	122000	No, no, we played five of these. We played five.
122000	125000	I think it's two, two, one.
125000	127000	You actually do have zero, so this could be your chance.
127000	129000	Mathematically, there are ten of these.
129000	131000	So you could come back and win this overall thing.
131000	132000	Yes, mathematically there are ten.
132000	133000	That's math.
134000	139000	As far as the map, almost unanimously I've seen people tweet to me that we should do,
139000	145000	I think, the snow one, because that has some crazy auction system for getting stars.
145000	146000	That sounds like fun.
146000	148000	I know we have typically done the basic one...
148000	154000	Yeah, we've usually tried to stick to the basic one to try to establish a baseline of the Mario Party experience.
154000	155000	Yes.
155000	157000	But I suppose this is not ranking of Mario Party.
157000	158000	No, this isn't hard science.
158000	161000	Because they are all tied for fucking last.
161000	165000	Look at these guys. They're great. They're like the Snow Brothers.
165000	166000	Do you have these amiibos?
166000	167000	I would.
167000	169000	They're like the Snow Brothers. You take that back.
169000	170000	Look at this little scene.
170000	176000	Fucking Prince Nick and Tom are fucking real video game characters in real video games.
176000	181000	Not sun face and moon face that Hudson fucking cooked up.
181000	184000	Alright, let's do the snow then, I guess.
184000	187000	We're going to be here all night.
189000	191000	It's probably good this room doesn't have any windows.
191000	192000	Fifty turns?
192000	193000	Yeah.
193000	194000	Yes.
194000	196000	Are you sure about this?
196000	198000	This is your last chance.
198000	199000	I hear this is the best one.
199000	200000	Okay.
200000	201000	Yeah.
205000	206000	Here we go.
206000	207000	We're going.
207000	208000	Yeah.
210000	211000	Alright, Wario.
211000	212000	Ugh.
212000	213000	Why?
213000	215000	Because you've got on a race face.
215000	216000	Mike made a game.
216000	217000	Mike made a game.
217000	218000	Oh shit.
218000	219000	Cheat your mouth off.
219000	220000	Word heard.
220000	221000	Mike, oh it's Mike's.
221000	222000	Well, it's a mic.
222000	223000	Maybe you use the mic.
223000	224000	Does he need the mic?
224000	225000	Is he the solo player?
225000	226000	Probably.
226000	227000	Let's see what's going on here.
227000	230440	One player shouts orders to herd the goombas away from the other players who try to punch
230440	232000	them out of the corral.
232000	235900	Wario, you can say up, down, right, left, or scramble.
235900	236900	We move and punch.
236900	237900	Wait, am I directing the goombas?
237900	238900	Yes.
238900	239900	Okay.
239900	242000	You have a horde of goombas that you want to kill us.
242000	243000	What is it?
243000	244000	Up, down, right, left, and punch?
244000	246640	Wait, you want to give them orders to keep them away from the fence.
246640	249000	What were the terms, the directions, and what was the other one?
249000	250000	Let's see.
250000	251000	Oh god.
251000	253000	Up, down, right, left, and scramble.
253000	255000	Goombas won't listen to orders while they're moving.
255000	258000	Wait until they stop before giving them another command.
258000	262000	You want to keep them in, we want to punch them out of the corral.
262000	264000	If you guys can hear what I'm saying, that's kind of...
264000	266000	Up, down, left, right, and scramble.
266000	267000	Fun is what that is.
267000	268000	All right.
268000	269000	Fun is what they call that.
269000	270000	This is a really...
270000	273000	Yeah, I think you have to push the button on the mic as well.
273000	277000	This looks like Big Boss's Isagar.
277000	279000	All right, here we go.
279000	280000	Down.
280000	282000	Do I have to get all of them?
282000	283000	Left.
283000	284000	It's working.
284000	285000	Right.
285000	286000	Scramble.
286000	287000	Down.
287000	288000	Down.
288000	289000	No, down.
289000	290000	Down, you fuckers.
290000	291000	Right.
291000	292000	Right.
292000	293000	Up.
293000	294000	They're going right.
294000	295000	Scramble.
295000	296000	Scramble.
296000	297000	Scramble.
297000	298000	Right.
298000	299000	Down.
299000	300000	Almost got it.
300000	301000	Down.
301000	302000	Up.
302000	303000	Up.
303000	304000	Up.
304000	305000	Up.
305000	306000	Up.
306000	307000	Down.
307000	308000	Down.
308000	309000	Down.
309000	310000	Down.
310000	311000	Down.
312000	313000	Whoo!
313000	314000	Look at that little dickhead.
314000	315000	Goddammit.
315000	317000	This game's awesome.
317000	318000	Fuck.
318000	319000	Yeah.
319000	320000	Huh.
320000	321000	Goddammit!
321000	322000	Are you fucking kidding me?
322000	323000	Of course I do.
323000	324000	Dan, you should maybe move off that space.
324000	330000	I want to fucking move off that space.
330000	331000	Are you kidding me?
331000	332000	Oh, no.
332000	333000	It's fine.
333000	334000	Oh, no!
334000	335000	It's fine.
335000	336000	We're just building the Rocky story here.
336000	337000	I want the fire.
337000	338000	We're just building the underdog story.
338000	339000	All right.
339000	340000	Fuck.
340000	342000	Oh, fuck me!
342000	345000	What a piece of shit.
345000	346000	Yeah!
346000	347000	Fuck this car, man.
347000	350000	It is a piece of shit.
350000	351000	Goddammit.
351000	354000	Now do you eat the space that you landed on, or?
354000	355000	I don't know.
355000	357000	I think you go to Bowser's space, too.
357000	358000	Yep.
358000	360000	Give him back, Bowser.
360000	364000	Waluigi's always been good to Bowser.
364000	365000	Wait.
365000	366000	Wait.
366000	367000	We got it.
367000	368000	You get that?
368000	369000	We got it.
369000	370000	I thought we did a good job.
370000	371000	Finish!
371000	376000	See, I got a dominatrix printer.
376000	381000	Did you say dominatrix printer?
381000	383000	It's my dream.
383000	385000	I don't know how that works, really.
385000	390000	I'll show you.
390000	392000	Do you refer to your printer as daddy?
392000	394000	No, it's the network name.
394000	396000	I did not refer to it.
396000	398000	I'm not allowed to.
399000	406000	You always speak to your printer when spoken to.
406000	411000	Tells me the printhead is broken and that I'm a failure for not preparing it.
411000	413000	And then I lick the cartridge for an hour.
413000	416000	It tells you how very bad you are at maintaining a printer.
416000	420000	So, so bad.
420000	423000	This seems like a real video game here.
423000	425000	Little Koopa Raptors.
425000	428000	Fire.
428000	429000	That takes forever.
429000	431000	Laser.
431000	433000	Laser.
433000	434000	Laser.
434000	435000	Okay.
435000	439000	Missile.
439000	440000	Missile.
440000	442000	This is so good.
442000	445000	Drop bombs.
445000	448000	So just the little green things we're trying to...
448000	451000	Fire.
451000	452000	What green things?
452000	455000	There's little green things on top of his, like to the right and left of him.
455000	456000	Missile.
456000	457000	They're only on the right now.
457000	458000	Missile.
458000	463000	Fire.
463000	464000	Laser.
464000	465000	Laser.
465000	468000	Laser.
468000	472000	Missile.
472000	477000	Fire.
477000	478000	Laser.
478000	479000	Mario, it's up to you.
479000	481000	Laser.
481000	482000	Cool boy.
482000	484000	Mario, you've played a lot of shooters.
484000	485000	Arcade shooters.
485000	486000	You can do this.
486000	487000	Fire.
487000	488000	No time limit.
488000	489000	Drop bombs.
489000	492000	I got one more to get, Jeff.
492000	494000	Look out for fire.
494000	496000	Look out for fire.
496000	497000	Laser.
497000	498000	What the fuck?
498000	499000	Get out of the way.
499000	500000	Yes.
500000	501000	So it's not the shadows.
501000	502000	What the fuck was with the bombs?
502000	503000	The fire comes up afterwards.
503000	505000	I love this microphone.
505000	507000	It's working for you.
507000	509000	Nothing but dodging, right?
509000	510000	Yeah, just move.
511000	513000	Really scary.
513000	514000	Eh.
514000	516000	There's like a blast.
516000	517000	Oh boy.
517000	519000	Oh, you fucker.
519000	521000	It's my way.
521000	522000	Yes.
522000	523000	Okay.
523000	525000	Do we all lose all of our coins?
525000	526000	Oh, that would be awesome.
526000	527000	Wait, what?
527000	528000	Why are we all in cages?
528000	529000	That would be great.
529000	530000	Because we're going to die.
530000	536000	Is this the Temple of Doom scene?
536000	540000	This is your life and it's ending one Mario party at a time.
540000	542000	Why are you fucking kidding me?
542000	544000	I hope it's everyone.
544000	546000	Do we all lose?
546000	547000	Fucking Bowser.
547000	550000	Man, Bowser's the great equalizer.
550000	552000	Wow.
552000	554000	Fuck.
554000	556000	Same as lame.
556000	557000	True.
557000	558000	The Mario party mantra.
558000	559000	They're all lame.
562000	564000	It's impressive if you're the only player to choose that button.
564000	565000	Your platform will rise.
565000	566000	Ooh.
566000	567000	You fucking.
567000	568000	Wow.
569000	570000	Man.
570000	575000	And we're also not going to use all of the buttons on the controls.
575000	578000	Top tier mini game design going on in Mario Party 6.
578000	582000	I don't know, what if we just had to even pick a button and if no one else picks it,
582000	583000	they win?
583000	584000	I don't know, man.
584000	586000	Don't look at my controller.
587000	589000	It's a psychological mind game.
589000	590000	Go.
593000	595000	Never guess what I picked.
596000	597000	Yes.
599000	601000	I'm going to pick A.
603000	605000	I bet he's not going to pick A.
606000	607000	He's lying.
607000	608000	I picked A.
608000	610000	So did I because fuck you.
611000	613000	I'm going to pick A.
616000	617000	I'm done with you.
617000	619000	I like how much time they give you to pick a button.
619000	620000	Yes.
620000	621000	Dammit.
621000	622000	Oh god.
622000	623000	Jeff, what are you picking?
623000	624000	A.
629000	630000	Yes.
630000	631000	Wait.
631000	632000	We should stop both picking L.
632000	633000	I would say.
634000	635000	We're good at that.
635000	636000	Yeah.
636000	637000	We're really good at that.
637000	638000	Mind games.
639000	640000	Alright, yeah.
640000	642000	Rock, paper, scissors for idiots.
648000	650000	I think this is a bad game.
650000	651000	Oh yeah?
651000	652000	Yeah.
654000	655000	Hiddifold.
656000	657000	Hiddifold.
659000	660000	You're both right.
661000	663000	Choose one of the three ropes.
663000	665000	Whoever chooses correctly,
666000	668000	swings to the platform with...
671000	673000	So if neither of us swing to the platform,
673000	675000	the fly guy will rescue one of us.
677000	678000	Sorry Drew.
678000	681000	So randomness on randomness in that case.
681000	682000	Can't call it random.
682000	684000	Both of you play randomly,
684000	685000	but if you're bad at being random,
685000	687000	we will randomly choose a winner.
688000	689000	Wait.
689000	690000	This is what I'm hearing.
699000	700000	Very dramatic.
701000	702000	Finish!
706000	707000	This was a mistake.
707000	708000	Risk no reward.
708000	709000	Video games were a mistake.
713000	714000	Good names.
714000	715000	Good names.
715000	716000	Across the board.
716000	717000	Every one of these games.
720000	721000	No.
721000	722000	Not really.
722000	723000	Because it's like fucking...
723000	724000	I don't know.
724000	725000	What are those names again?
725000	726000	Bill Hill.
726000	727000	I don't know.
727000	728000	Done.
728000	729000	Do you think they come up with a name
729000	730000	and then they make the mini game?
730000	731000	What would Bill Hill be?
731000	732000	Bill Hill would be a fucking bunch
732000	733000	of bullet bill launchers,
733000	734000	and then there's a fucking hill,
734000	735000	and you want to stay on the hill,
735000	736000	but there's a bunch of fucking
736000	737000	bullet bills launching at you
737000	739000	to make it hard to fucking stay on the hill.
739000	740000	Alright, let's keep this going.
740000	741000	I think we can do this.
741000	742000	What's the next mini game?
742000	743000	You work at Nintendo, Jim.
743000	744000	Congratulations.
744000	745000	You guys are Mario Party developers.
748000	749000	In a perfect world,
749000	750000	we all could have shared
750000	752000	in screwing over Dan equally.
752000	753000	Don't worry, because now it's his turn.
760000	763000	Don't make the worst turn.
763000	764000	Waste one of his items.
764000	765000	Do it.
786000	787000	He's going back.
787000	788000	Don't do it.
788000	789000	I don't want to do that.
790000	791000	What are you doing?
792000	794000	Could you burn one and...
794000	795000	Oh.
801000	802000	That was a level of savagery
802000	804000	I was not prepared for.
809000	810000	Of course.
812000	813000	Of course.
814000	815000	Oh wait, are you...
815000	817000	Is that the same one Brad tried to do?
817000	818000	Fuck.
819000	820000	Fuck.
820000	822000	Yes, we are losing stars.
829000	830000	That's a big number.
830000	832000	That's a really big number.
832000	834000	Yeah, but I mean, where's...
834000	836000	I think I'm pretty far away.
836000	838000	He's pretty far.
838000	839000	You're like...
839000	840000	That's a big roll.
840000	841000	You're all the way in the top right corner
841000	842000	where the chomp is.
842000	843000	Am I?
843000	844000	Oh my God.
844000	845000	Wow.
845000	847000	I take all y'all's shit.
851000	852000	Man.
852000	853000	Holy shit.
853000	855000	That was some run.
857000	858000	Dan, give me a sticker.
860000	861000	Here, I'll give you some money.
862000	863000	Hang on.
863000	864000	Oh, he's running.
864000	865000	While he's running.
874000	876000	I guess we'll be right back.
894000	895000	Golly.
896000	897000	Jeez, man.
898000	899000	Got some stuff.
899000	900000	Wow.
900000	901000	I'll say.
901000	902000	We've been breaking in your absence.
903000	904000	No.
904000	905000	People said you were playing Waluigi
905000	906000	and that you chomped a star away from me.
906000	907000	No, we didn't.
907000	908000	I'm with Twitter.
909000	910000	People are no fun.
910000	911000	Bring snacks for everyone
911000	912000	and you guys have betrayed me.
912000	913000	No actually.
913000	914000	No.
914000	915000	No.
915000	916000	No.
916000	917000	No.
917000	918000	No.
918000	919000	No.
919000	920000	No.
920000	921000	No.
921000	922000	No.
922000	923000	No.
923000	924000	Are you kidding me?
924000	925000	No, actually these are not from me.
925000	928000	I got a tweet from SkullPanda1 on Twitter
928000	930000	saying there should be snacks waiting for you guys
930000	931000	in the lobby.
933000	934000	What?
934000	935000	I don't know what this is.
935000	936000	Really?
936000	937000	SkullPanda1.
937000	938000	Okay.
938000	939000	This is my stuff.
940000	941000	Man.
941000	942000	A lotta.
942000	944000	It's a strawberry and a lime-arita.
944000	945000	Here's your Snickers.
945000	946000	Thanks.
946000	947000	That's the stuff you bought.
947000	948000	That's the stuff I bought.
948000	949000	This is all SkullPanda1 here.
950000	951000	I don't know what we got.
951000	952000	I just feel like it's gonna be
952000	955000	just like a bag of fucking dog crap.
955000	956000	Here you go.
956000	958000	For use with Mario Party.
958000	959000	It's a bag of human skulls.
959000	960000	Oh boy.
960000	961000	Double Stuck Oreos.
961000	962000	Oh I see.
962000	963000	Yes.
963000	964000	Oh no.
964000	965000	Yes.
965000	966000	Oh my god.
966000	967000	What a pleasant surprise.
968000	969000	Jason?
969000	970000	Oh wow.
970000	971000	Wait, what?
971000	972000	He knows Jason's order too.
972000	973000	Fuck.
973000	974000	Yes.
974000	975000	Jason into some pharmacies?
975000	976000	I'll take that.
976000	977000	Oh yeah.
977000	978000	Oh yeah.
978000	979000	I did not know that.
979000	980000	Oh man.
980000	981000	And then whatever this stuff is.
981000	982000	Some fancy water.
982000	983000	I don't know.
983000	984000	Fancy water.
984000	985000	Perrier.
985000	986000	Perrier.
986000	987000	Oh my god.
987000	988000	It's gonna be Oreos and nachos.
988000	989000	Slim cans.
989000	990000	Slim cans.
990000	991000	Throw the lime slim cans in there.
991000	992000	I don't think I've ever had Perrier before.
992000	993000	It's sparkling water.
993000	994000	Is that it?
994000	995000	Wow.
995000	996000	Yeah.
996000	997000	Okay.
997000	998000	All right.
998000	999000	Someone says Red Vines.
999000	1000000	I say how high.
1000000	1001000	Yeah.
1001000	1002000	I'll have the Red Vine.
1002000	1004000	That's probably about it though.
1004000	1007000	Not even heating up the cheese, huh?
1007000	1008000	Nah.
1008000	1009000	Fuck it.
1009000	1010000	Oh no.
1010000	1011000	Oh.
1011000	1012000	Oh.
1012000	1013000	Mm.
1013000	1014000	Mm-hmm.
1014000	1015000	Mm-hmm.
1015000	1016000	Mm-hmm.
1016000	1017000	Yeah.
1017000	1018000	Well, let's see that cheese.
1018000	1019000	Yeah.
1019000	1020000	Yeah.
1020000	1021000	Keep going.
1021000	1023000	It's a Mario party.
1023000	1026000	I hate myself and want to die.
1026000	1027000	Fuck.
1027000	1028000	Yeah.
1028000	1030000	That's no good.
1030000	1031000	Yeah?
1031000	1032000	Yeah.
1032000	1033000	All right.
1033000	1036000	I get the mic.
1037000	1038000	Do I get it?
1038000	1040000	I get the mic.
1040000	1043000	Should I put like three Oreos in my mouth before we do the mic game?
1043000	1044000	Yeah.
1044000	1045000	Probably.
1045000	1046000	This is my favorite air album.
1046000	1048000	I think I could do two safely.
1048000	1049000	All right.
1049000	1051000	Let's read the rules and I'll put the Oreos in.
1051000	1053000	One player speaks commands to reach the goal.
1053000	1056000	The other three will try to hit them with a spiny.
1056000	1057000	That's me.
1057000	1058000	Forward, move back.
1058000	1059000	I'm just back.
1059000	1060000	Right and left.
1060000	1061000	Forward, move back.
1061000	1062000	Right and left.
1062000	1065000	You move the cursor and throw a spiny ball.
1065000	1066000	So, okay.
1066000	1067000	So I'm just standing there.
1067000	1068000	All right.
1068000	1069000	All right.
1069000	1070000	Are you ready?
1071000	1072000	Whoa.
1072000	1073000	Whoa.
1073000	1074000	Oh.
1074000	1075000	Oh.
1075000	1076000	Right.
1076000	1077000	Whoa.
1077000	1078000	Okay.
1078000	1085000	Just a decent amount of lag there.
1085000	1091000	Let's move back and forward.
1091000	1094000	Oh, man.
1095000	1098000	You got a chain reaction?
1098000	1099000	Diana Reeves?
1099000	1100000	Warner Freeman, right?
1100000	1101000	Warner Freeman.
1101000	1102000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1102000	1105000	Anybody see that Point Break remake?
1105000	1106000	No.
1106000	1108000	I think that kind of came and went.
1108000	1109000	I've never really been a bit...
1109000	1111000	I was not a huge fan of the original Point Break.
1111000	1112000	I've never seen it.
1112000	1114000	I don't have a reverence for it the way some people do.
1114000	1117000	Yeah, there seems to be a real like cult following around that movie.
1117000	1121000	I dated the girl whose brother is named after Patrick Swayze from Point Break.
1121000	1122000	All right.
1122000	1123000	Bodhi is her brother.
1124000	1125000	Wow.
1125000	1130000	His parents must have really fucking sucked.
1130000	1132000	That's his name is Bodhi.
1132000	1137000	That's a fucking real like just...
1137000	1138000	Nope.
1142000	1145000	At a certain point playing this, I forget that we're actually like broadcasting this
1145000	1146000	to thousands of people.
1146000	1149000	Like it draws me in to that degree.
1149000	1150000	Yes.
1150000	1151000	I think that is a testament to the game.
1151000	1152000	It is utterly riveting.
1152000	1154000	I think it's a testament to the game.
1154000	1157000	And you're drinking.
1157000	1158000	Also true.
1160000	1161000	My game.
1161000	1162000	Yes.
1162000	1163000	Hooray.
1163000	1164000	Give me that goddamn microphone.
1164000	1166000	Do you want to do the Oreo challenge?
1166000	1167000	No.
1167000	1168000	It worked great for me.
1168000	1169000	What was that?
1169000	1173000	When you put two Oreos in your mouth and try to do this.
1173000	1176000	Is this fucking mine?
1176000	1177000	This one is dumb.
1177000	1179000	Up, down, left, right, scramble.
1180000	1185000	Hey, this is monkeys from Yoshi's Island.
1185000	1189000	They eat the watermelons and you can steal it from them.
1189000	1190000	Left.
1190000	1191000	Go left.
1191000	1192000	What do you mean?
1192000	1193000	How do you punch?
1193000	1194000	Go right.
1194000	1196000	You're just knocking them out.
1196000	1197000	Scramble.
1197000	1198000	Scramble.
1198000	1199000	This is tough.
1199000	1200000	Go down.
1200000	1202000	I'm wasting all my time on one of them.
1202000	1203000	Go right.
1203000	1204000	Go up.
1204000	1207000	Now we're making progress.
1207000	1208000	Scramble.
1208000	1209000	Scramble.
1210000	1211000	Go down.
1211000	1212000	Oh, we got this.
1212000	1213000	Go right.
1213000	1214000	We got this.
1214000	1215000	Yeah, we got it.
1215000	1216000	Fuck.
1216000	1217000	Go up.
1217000	1218000	I don't know.
1218000	1219000	Everyone take a goomba.
1219000	1220000	No.
1220000	1221000	Everyone take a goomba.
1221000	1222000	Go down.
1222000	1223000	Fuck.
1223000	1224000	I'm about to sprint for it.
1224000	1227000	Fuck this shit.
1227000	1228000	You won.
1228000	1229000	Don't care.
1239000	1241000	You're just joining us.
1241000	1247000	We're entering the back third of...
1248000	1249000	Yes.
1251000	1254000	We could bring in commentary for one of these.
1257000	1259000	I'm Byron Saxton.
1265000	1266000	Stop.
1268000	1269000	Go.
1271000	1273000	Got some goombas.
1275000	1277000	Wow, you really only get one shot at that, huh?
1277000	1278000	Fuck.
1282000	1283000	I say blue.
1286000	1287000	Man.
1287000	1289000	Most fucking asinine way to fucking count this shit.
1289000	1290000	Are you kidding me?
1290000	1291000	Wow.
1291000	1292000	Fuck you.
1293000	1294000	You gotta pick up the mic, Jeff.
1294000	1295000	You gotta press the button.
1297000	1298000	Bite my ass.
1302000	1304000	Alright, game, mic, game, mic, game.
1310000	1311000	Good.
1311000	1314000	Three unplayed mini-games and Poke Punch-out.
1314000	1315000	That's...
1315000	1316000	Poke Punch-out.
1316000	1317000	Poke Punch-out.
1317000	1318000	Poke Punch-out.
1318000	1319000	Poke Punch-out.
1319000	1320000	Fosse & Poke Punch-out.
1320000	1322000	Poke Punch-out was alright.
1322000	1323000	That's fucking bullshit.
1323000	1324000	Memories?
1324000	1325000	Because that was the first one we did.
1325000	1326000	Fucked it.
1327000	1328000	Fuck you.
1328000	1329000	Oh man.
1329000	1330000	Oh my God.
1330000	1337000	I feel like I should text my girlfriend and tell her not to make dinner because I ate
1337000	1340000	too many orios.
1340000	1344000	Hurray the 5s are dancin'.
1344000	1345000	KellyHerox!
1345000	1346000	Dancing 5s.
1346000	1347000	Whoo!
1348000	1349000	Oh man.
1350000	1352000	I mean, Oreos are kind of like dinner.
1352000	1353000	Yeah.
1353000	1355000	You have to hit a button.
