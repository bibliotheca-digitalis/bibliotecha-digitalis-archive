00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello and welcome everyone. It's time. It happens every year and we're here. It is Eurovision time. We're here for the semi-finals, the live official stream.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're down to our final three competitors here. Representing Bosnia, Herzegovina. We've got Brad.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hi. What's going on?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Representing Wales, we've got Drew.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hi. Thanks. It's great to be here representing the country of Wales.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah. And representing Tulsa, Oklahoma, we've got Dan.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Jeff, you're horribly mistaken. I like the enthusiasm. Let's carry that through to what we're actually doing.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You want to tell the people what we're doing, Jeff?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Eurovision is happening.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No, no, no. Jeff, you were wrong.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No live animals allowed on the stage.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I just saw Kachida Worst right over there.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There is a microphone here.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yep. You guys are going to perform your songs for your given nation states?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There might be singing. I don't know.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And we are going to choose who moves on to the finals. It's a very exciting time. Of course, the finals are happening this weekend.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There will be a winner.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, there will, absolutely.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It is a competition.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The winner of Eurovision. And the voting is just a great time of year.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So we're watching the replay of the semi-finals. Is that what's happening here?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Semi-finals part two. We're going to get into this whole stuff here.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We just need to switch the TVs.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No, no. They got it on the right thing. This is the right audio here.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is this one of the songs?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, Jason.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Which song is this?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Italy?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is Italy's?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is the story of Brighton and Twyla.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is not a trophy-winning composition from what I'm hearing.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's nice just to be nominated.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's nice.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Laughter.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Giving my ten points to getting up and walking out of this room right now.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, you can't.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is the record here? I believe it's Brad has...

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Zero.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
One.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Drew has zero.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Dan has zero.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, no, we played five of these. We played five.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think it's two, two, one.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You actually do have zero, so this could be your chance.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Mathematically, there are ten of these.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So you could come back and win this overall thing.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes, mathematically there are ten.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's math.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
As far as the map, almost unanimously I've seen people tweet to me that we should do,

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I think, the snow one, because that has some crazy auction system for getting stars.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That sounds like fun.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I know we have typically done the basic one...

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, we've usually tried to stick to the basic one to try to establish a baseline of the Mario Party experience.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But I suppose this is not ranking of Mario Party.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, this isn't hard science.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Because they are all tied for fucking last.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Look at these guys. They're great. They're like the Snow Brothers.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you have these amiibos?

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I would.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They're like the Snow Brothers. You take that back.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Look at this little scene.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Fucking Prince Nick and Tom are fucking real video game characters in real video games.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Not sun face and moon face that Hudson fucking cooked up.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alright, let's do the snow then, I guess.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We're going to be here all night.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's probably good this room doesn't have any windows.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Fifty turns?

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Are you sure about this?

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is your last chance.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I hear this is the best one.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Here we go.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We're going.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Alright, Wario.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ugh.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why?

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because you've got on a race face.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Mike made a game.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Mike made a game.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh shit.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Cheat your mouth off.

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Word heard.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mike, oh it's Mike's.

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, it's a mic.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Maybe you use the mic.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Does he need the mic?

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is he the solo player?

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Probably.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's see what's going on here.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,440
One player shouts orders to herd the goombas away from the other players who try to punch

96
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,000
them out of the corral.

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,900
Wario, you can say up, down, right, left, or scramble.

98
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
We move and punch.

99
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
Wait, am I directing the goombas?

100
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Yes.

101
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Okay.

102
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,000
You have a horde of goombas that you want to kill us.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What is it?

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Up, down, right, left, and punch?

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,640
Wait, you want to give them orders to keep them away from the fence.

106
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,000
What were the terms, the directions, and what was the other one?

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's see.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh god.

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Up, down, right, left, and scramble.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Goombas won't listen to orders while they're moving.

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Wait until they stop before giving them another command.

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You want to keep them in, we want to punch them out of the corral.

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you guys can hear what I'm saying, that's kind of...

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Up, down, left, right, and scramble.

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Fun is what that is.

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Fun is what they call that.

118
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is a really...

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, I think you have to push the button on the mic as well.

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This looks like Big Boss's Isagar.

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
All right, here we go.

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Down.

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Do I have to get all of them?

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Left.

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's working.

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Right.

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Scramble.

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Down.

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Down.

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No, down.

131
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Down, you fuckers.

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Right.

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Right.

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Up.

135
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They're going right.

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Scramble.

137
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Scramble.

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Scramble.

139
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Right.

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Down.

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Almost got it.

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Down.

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Up.

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Up.

145
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Up.

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Up.

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Up.

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Down.

149
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Down.

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Down.

151
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Down.

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Down.

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Whoo!

154
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Look at that little dickhead.

155
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Goddammit.

156
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This game's awesome.

157
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Fuck.

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah.

159
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Huh.

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Goddammit!

161
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Of course I do.

163
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Dan, you should maybe move off that space.

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I want to fucking move off that space.

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Are you kidding me?

166
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, no.

167
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's fine.

168
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, no!

169
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's fine.

170
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're just building the Rocky story here.

171
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I want the fire.

172
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We're just building the underdog story.

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
All right.

174
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Fuck.

175
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, fuck me!

176
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What a piece of shit.

177
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah!

178
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Fuck this car, man.

179
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It is a piece of shit.

180
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Goddammit.

181
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Now do you eat the space that you landed on, or?

182
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know.

183
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think you go to Bowser's space, too.

184
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yep.

185
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Give him back, Bowser.

186
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Waluigi's always been good to Bowser.

187
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Wait.

188
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wait.

189
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We got it.

190
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You get that?

191
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We got it.

192
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I thought we did a good job.

193
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Finish!

194
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
See, I got a dominatrix printer.

195
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Did you say dominatrix printer?

196
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's my dream.

197
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know how that works, really.

198
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll show you.

199
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Do you refer to your printer as daddy?

200
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, it's the network name.

201
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I did not refer to it.

202
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm not allowed to.

203
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You always speak to your printer when spoken to.

204
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Tells me the printhead is broken and that I'm a failure for not preparing it.

205
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And then I lick the cartridge for an hour.

206
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It tells you how very bad you are at maintaining a printer.

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So, so bad.

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This seems like a real video game here.

209
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Little Koopa Raptors.

210
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Fire.

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That takes forever.

212
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Laser.

213
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Laser.

214
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Laser.

215
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

216
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Missile.

217
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Missile.

218
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is so good.

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Drop bombs.

220
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So just the little green things we're trying to...

221
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Fire.

222
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What green things?

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There's little green things on top of his, like to the right and left of him.

224
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Missile.

225
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They're only on the right now.

226
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Missile.

227
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Fire.

228
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Laser.

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Laser.

230
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Laser.

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Missile.

232
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Fire.

233
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Laser.

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mario, it's up to you.

235
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Laser.

236
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Cool boy.

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Mario, you've played a lot of shooters.

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Arcade shooters.

239
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You can do this.

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Fire.

241
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No time limit.

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Drop bombs.

243
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I got one more to get, Jeff.

244
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Look out for fire.

245
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Look out for fire.

246
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Laser.

247
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What the fuck?

248
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Get out of the way.

249
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

250
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So it's not the shadows.

251
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What the fuck was with the bombs?

252
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The fire comes up afterwards.

253
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I love this microphone.

254
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's working for you.

255
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Nothing but dodging, right?

256
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, just move.

257
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Really scary.

258
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Eh.

259
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There's like a blast.

260
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh boy.

261
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, you fucker.

262
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's my way.

263
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

264
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

265
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Do we all lose all of our coins?

266
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, that would be awesome.

267
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Wait, what?

268
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why are we all in cages?

269
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That would be great.

270
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Because we're going to die.

271
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is this the Temple of Doom scene?

272
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is your life and it's ending one Mario party at a time.

273
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Why are you fucking kidding me?

274
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I hope it's everyone.

275
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Do we all lose?

276
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Fucking Bowser.

277
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Man, Bowser's the great equalizer.

278
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Wow.

279
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Fuck.

280
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Same as lame.

281
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
True.

282
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The Mario party mantra.

283
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They're all lame.

284
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's impressive if you're the only player to choose that button.

285
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Your platform will rise.

286
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ooh.

287
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You fucking.

288
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Wow.

289
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Man.

290
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And we're also not going to use all of the buttons on the controls.

291
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Top tier mini game design going on in Mario Party 6.

292
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't know, what if we just had to even pick a button and if no one else picks it,

293
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
they win?

294
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know, man.

295
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't look at my controller.

296
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's a psychological mind game.

297
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Go.

298
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Never guess what I picked.

299
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

300
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm going to pick A.

301
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I bet he's not going to pick A.

302
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He's lying.

303
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I picked A.

304
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So did I because fuck you.

305
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm going to pick A.

306
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm done with you.

307
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I like how much time they give you to pick a button.

308
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes.

309
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Dammit.

310
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh god.

311
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Jeff, what are you picking?

312
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
A.

313
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

314
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Wait.

315
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We should stop both picking L.

316
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I would say.

317
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We're good at that.

318
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

319
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We're really good at that.

320
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mind games.

321
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Alright, yeah.

322
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Rock, paper, scissors for idiots.

323
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I think this is a bad game.

324
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh yeah?

325
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah.

326
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hiddifold.

327
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hiddifold.

328
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're both right.

329
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Choose one of the three ropes.

330
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Whoever chooses correctly,

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
swings to the platform with...

332
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So if neither of us swing to the platform,

333
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the fly guy will rescue one of us.

334
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Sorry Drew.

335
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So randomness on randomness in that case.

336
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can't call it random.

337
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Both of you play randomly,

338
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but if you're bad at being random,

339
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
we will randomly choose a winner.

340
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Wait.

341
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is what I'm hearing.

342
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Very dramatic.

343
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Finish!

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This was a mistake.

345
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Risk no reward.

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Video games were a mistake.

347
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Good names.

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Good names.

349
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Across the board.

350
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Every one of these games.

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No.

352
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Not really.

353
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because it's like fucking...

354
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't know.

355
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What are those names again?

356
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Bill Hill.

357
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know.

358
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Done.

359
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Do you think they come up with a name

360
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and then they make the mini game?

361
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What would Bill Hill be?

362
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Bill Hill would be a fucking bunch

363
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
of bullet bill launchers,

364
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and then there's a fucking hill,

365
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and you want to stay on the hill,

366
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but there's a bunch of fucking

367
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
bullet bills launching at you

368
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
to make it hard to fucking stay on the hill.

369
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Alright, let's keep this going.

370
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think we can do this.

371
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What's the next mini game?

372
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You work at Nintendo, Jim.

373
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Congratulations.

374
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You guys are Mario Party developers.

375
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
In a perfect world,

376
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
we all could have shared

377
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in screwing over Dan equally.

378
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't worry, because now it's his turn.

379
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't make the worst turn.

380
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Waste one of his items.

381
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Do it.

382
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He's going back.

383
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't do it.

384
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't want to do that.

385
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What are you doing?

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Could you burn one and...

387
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh.

388
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That was a level of savagery

389
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I was not prepared for.

390
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Of course.

391
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Of course.

392
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh wait, are you...

393
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is that the same one Brad tried to do?

394
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Fuck.

395
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Fuck.

396
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes, we are losing stars.

397
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's a big number.

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's a really big number.

399
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah, but I mean, where's...

400
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think I'm pretty far away.

401
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He's pretty far.

402
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're like...

403
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's a big roll.

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're all the way in the top right corner

405
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
where the chomp is.

406
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Am I?

407
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh my God.

408
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Wow.

409
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I take all y'all's shit.

410
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Man.

411
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Holy shit.

412
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That was some run.

413
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Dan, give me a sticker.

414
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Here, I'll give you some money.

415
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hang on.

416
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh, he's running.

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
While he's running.

418
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I guess we'll be right back.

419
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Golly.

420
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Jeez, man.

421
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Got some stuff.

422
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Wow.

423
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll say.

424
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We've been breaking in your absence.

425
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
No.

426
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
People said you were playing Waluigi

427
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and that you chomped a star away from me.

428
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No, we didn't.

429
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm with Twitter.

430
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
People are no fun.

431
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Bring snacks for everyone

432
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and you guys have betrayed me.

433
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No actually.

434
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No.

435
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No.

436
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No.

437
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
No.

438
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No.

439
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
No.

440
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No.

441
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No.

442
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No.

443
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No.

444
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Are you kidding me?

445
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, actually these are not from me.

446
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I got a tweet from SkullPanda1 on Twitter

447
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
saying there should be snacks waiting for you guys

448
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
in the lobby.

449
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What?

450
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't know what this is.

451
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Really?

452
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
SkullPanda1.

453
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

454
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
This is my stuff.

455
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Man.

456
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
A lotta.

457
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's a strawberry and a lime-arita.

458
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Here's your Snickers.

459
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Thanks.

460
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's the stuff you bought.

461
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's the stuff I bought.

462
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This is all SkullPanda1 here.

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't know what we got.

464
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I just feel like it's gonna be

465
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
just like a bag of fucking dog crap.

466
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Here you go.

467
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
For use with Mario Party.

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's a bag of human skulls.

469
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh boy.

470
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Double Stuck Oreos.

471
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh I see.

472
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes.

473
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh no.

474
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes.

475
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh my god.

476
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What a pleasant surprise.

477
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Jason?

478
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh wow.

479
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Wait, what?

480
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He knows Jason's order too.

481
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Fuck.

482
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes.

483
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Jason into some pharmacies?

484
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll take that.

485
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh yeah.

486
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh yeah.

487
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I did not know that.

488
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh man.

489
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And then whatever this stuff is.

490
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Some fancy water.

491
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't know.

492
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Fancy water.

493
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Perrier.

494
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Perrier.

495
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh my god.

496
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's gonna be Oreos and nachos.

497
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Slim cans.

498
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Slim cans.

499
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Throw the lime slim cans in there.

500
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't think I've ever had Perrier before.

501
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's sparkling water.

502
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Is that it?

503
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Wow.

504
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah.

505
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay.

506
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
All right.

507
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Someone says Red Vines.

508
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I say how high.

509
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah.

510
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll have the Red Vine.

511
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's probably about it though.

512
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Not even heating up the cheese, huh?

513
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Nah.

514
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Fuck it.

515
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh no.

516
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Oh.

517
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh.

518
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Mm.

519
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Mm-hmm.

520
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Mm-hmm.

521
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Mm-hmm.

522
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

523
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Well, let's see that cheese.

524
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah.

525
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah.

526
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Keep going.

527
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's a Mario party.

528
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I hate myself and want to die.

529
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Fuck.

530
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah.

531
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's no good.

532
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah?

533
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah.

534
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
All right.

535
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I get the mic.

536
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Do I get it?

537
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I get the mic.

538
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Should I put like three Oreos in my mouth before we do the mic game?

539
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

540
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Probably.

541
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This is my favorite air album.

542
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I think I could do two safely.

543
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
All right.

544
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Let's read the rules and I'll put the Oreos in.

545
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
One player speaks commands to reach the goal.

546
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The other three will try to hit them with a spiny.

547
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's me.

548
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Forward, move back.

549
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm just back.

550
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Right and left.

551
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Forward, move back.

552
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Right and left.

553
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You move the cursor and throw a spiny ball.

554
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So, okay.

555
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So I'm just standing there.

556
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
All right.

557
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
All right.

558
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Are you ready?

559
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Whoa.

560
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Whoa.

561
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh.

562
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh.

563
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Right.

564
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Whoa.

565
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Okay.

566
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Just a decent amount of lag there.

567
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's move back and forward.

568
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, man.

569
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You got a chain reaction?

570
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Diana Reeves?

571
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Warner Freeman, right?

572
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Warner Freeman.

573
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

574
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Anybody see that Point Break remake?

575
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No.

576
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think that kind of came and went.

577
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I've never really been a bit...

578
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I was not a huge fan of the original Point Break.

579
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I've never seen it.

580
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't have a reverence for it the way some people do.

581
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, there seems to be a real like cult following around that movie.

582
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I dated the girl whose brother is named after Patrick Swayze from Point Break.

583
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
All right.

584
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Bodhi is her brother.

585
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Wow.

586
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
His parents must have really fucking sucked.

587
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's his name is Bodhi.

588
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's a fucking real like just...

589
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Nope.

590
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
At a certain point playing this, I forget that we're actually like broadcasting this

591
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
to thousands of people.

592
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Like it draws me in to that degree.

593
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes.

594
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think that is a testament to the game.

595
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It is utterly riveting.

596
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I think it's a testament to the game.

597
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And you're drinking.

598
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Also true.

599
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
My game.

600
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yes.

601
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Hooray.

602
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Give me that goddamn microphone.

603
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Do you want to do the Oreo challenge?

604
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No.

605
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It worked great for me.

606
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What was that?

607
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
When you put two Oreos in your mouth and try to do this.

608
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Is this fucking mine?

609
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
This one is dumb.

610
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Up, down, left, right, scramble.

611
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Hey, this is monkeys from Yoshi's Island.

612
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
They eat the watermelons and you can steal it from them.

613
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Left.

614
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Go left.

615
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What do you mean?

616
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
How do you punch?

617
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Go right.

618
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're just knocking them out.

619
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Scramble.

620
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Scramble.

621
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is tough.

622
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Go down.

623
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm wasting all my time on one of them.

624
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Go right.

625
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Go up.

626
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Now we're making progress.

627
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Scramble.

628
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Scramble.

629
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Go down.

630
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, we got this.

631
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Go right.

632
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We got this.

633
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, we got it.

634
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Fuck.

635
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Go up.

636
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't know.

637
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Everyone take a goomba.

638
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No.

639
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Everyone take a goomba.

640
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Go down.

641
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Fuck.

642
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm about to sprint for it.

643
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Fuck this shit.

644
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You won.

645
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't care.

646
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You're just joining us.

647
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We're entering the back third of...

648
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes.

649
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We could bring in commentary for one of these.

650
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm Byron Saxton.

651
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Stop.

652
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Go.

653
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Got some goombas.

654
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Wow, you really only get one shot at that, huh?

655
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Fuck.

656
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I say blue.

657
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Man.

658
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Most fucking asinine way to fucking count this shit.

659
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Are you kidding me?

660
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Wow.

661
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Fuck you.

662
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You gotta pick up the mic, Jeff.

663
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You gotta press the button.

664
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Bite my ass.

665
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Alright, game, mic, game, mic, game.

666
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Good.

667
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Three unplayed mini-games and Poke Punch-out.

668
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's...

669
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Poke Punch-out.

670
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Poke Punch-out.

671
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Poke Punch-out.

672
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Poke Punch-out.

673
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Fosse & Poke Punch-out.

674
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Poke Punch-out was alright.

675
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That's fucking bullshit.

676
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Memories?

677
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Because that was the first one we did.

678
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Fucked it.

679
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Fuck you.

680
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh man.

681
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh my God.

682
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I feel like I should text my girlfriend and tell her not to make dinner because I ate

683
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
too many orios.

684
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Hurray the 5s are dancin'.

685
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
KellyHerox!

686
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Dancing 5s.

687
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Whoo!

688
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh man.

689
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I mean, Oreos are kind of like dinner.

690
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah.

691
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You have to hit a button.

692
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Or you just want to watch the 5s dance.

693
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Whoo!

694
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I mean, I'm okay with that.

695
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
55 spaces.

696
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Here we go.

697
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So your spaces, your bonus you got for being in last, puts you directly in front of a chain

698
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
jump hut.

699
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Fuck that.

700
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Wait.

701
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No.

702
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That.

703
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What the fuck is going on here?

704
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's me taking your coins.

705
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's what that is.

706
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Everything that happened sucked.

707
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Getting coined up.

708
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Oh.

709
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What?

710
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Mike.

711
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Dang it.

712
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Meh.

713
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I guess that's my room.

714
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's like it knows.

715
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What a shitty.

716
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Laser, missile, laser, drag your goombas, fire, drop bombs, fire goombas, laser, missile,

717
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
laser, laser, drop bombs, drop bombs, fire goomba, goomba goomba, fire, fire, laser, laser.

718
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
All right.

719
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
All right.

720
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Great.

721
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Awesome.

722
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Well, we're done.

723
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You're a superstar.

724
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
First of three.

725
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm a star.

726
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm a star.

727
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm a star.

728
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Great.

729
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah.

730
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Thank you for putting the game on, Twilight and Broodbree.

731
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This is the final star count.

732
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Just skip the score screen.

733
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah.

734
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Completely.

735
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Probably.

736
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I don't know.

737
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Can you do Mike games?

738
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Who's ready to go again?

739
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I mean, fair or square?

740
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Wow.

741
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
What a day it's been.

742
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Thanks everyone for joining us.

743
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Wow.

744
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This has been really fantastic.

745
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I can only hope that you enjoyed watching this as much as we enjoyed playing it for you.
