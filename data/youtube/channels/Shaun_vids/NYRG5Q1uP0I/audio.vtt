00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello and welcome everyone. It's time. It happens every year and we're here. It is Eurovision time. We're here for the semi-finals, the live official stream.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
We're down to our final three competitors here. Representing Bosnia, Herzegovina. We've got Brad.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Hi. What's going on?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Representing Wales, we've got Drew.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Hi. Thanks. It's great to be here representing the country of Wales.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah. And representing Tulsa, Oklahoma, we've got Dan.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Jeff, you're horribly mistaken. I like the enthusiasm. Let's carry that through to what we're actually doing.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
You want to tell the people what we're doing, Jeff?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Eurovision is happening.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
No, no, no. Jeff, you were wrong.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
No live animals allowed on the stage.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I just saw Kachida Worst right over there.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
There is a microphone here.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Yep. You guys are going to perform your songs for your given nation states?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
There might be singing. I don't know.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
And we are going to choose who moves on to the finals. It's a very exciting time. Of course, the finals are happening this weekend.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
There will be a winner.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, there will, absolutely.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
It is a competition.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
The winner of Eurovision. And the voting is just a great time of year.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
So we're watching the replay of the semi-finals. Is that what's happening here?

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Semi-finals part two. We're going to get into this whole stuff here.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
We just need to switch the TVs.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
No, no. They got it on the right thing. This is the right audio here.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Is this one of the songs?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, Jason.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Which song is this?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Italy?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
This is Italy's?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
This is the story of Brighton and Twyla.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
This is not a trophy-winning composition from what I'm hearing.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
It's nice just to be nominated.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
That's nice.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Laughter.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Giving my ten points to getting up and walking out of this room right now.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Oh, you can't.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
What is the record here? I believe it's Brad has...

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Zero.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
One.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Drew has zero.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Dan has zero.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
No, no, we played five of these. We played five.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I think it's two, two, one.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
You actually do have zero, so this could be your chance.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Mathematically, there are ten of these.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
So you could come back and win this overall thing.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Yes, mathematically there are ten.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
That's math.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
As far as the map, almost unanimously I've seen people tweet to me that we should do,

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
I think, the snow one, because that has some crazy auction system for getting stars.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
That sounds like fun.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I know we have typically done the basic one...

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
Yeah, we've usually tried to stick to the basic one to try to establish a baseline of the Mario Party experience.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yes.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
But I suppose this is not ranking of Mario Party.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
No, this isn't hard science.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Because they are all tied for fucking last.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Look at these guys. They're great. They're like the Snow Brothers.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Do you have these amiibos?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I would.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
They're like the Snow Brothers. You take that back.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Look at this little scene.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
Fucking Prince Nick and Tom are fucking real video game characters in real video games.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Not sun face and moon face that Hudson fucking cooked up.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Alright, let's do the snow then, I guess.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
We're going to be here all night.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
It's probably good this room doesn't have any windows.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Fifty turns?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yes.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Are you sure about this?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
This is your last chance.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I hear this is the best one.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Okay.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Here we go.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
We're going.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Alright, Wario.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Ugh.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Why?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Because you've got on a race face.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Mike made a game.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Mike made a game.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh shit.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Cheat your mouth off.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Word heard.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Mike, oh it's Mike's.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, it's a mic.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Maybe you use the mic.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Does he need the mic?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Is he the solo player?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Probably.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Let's see what's going on here.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.440
One player shouts orders to herd the goombas away from the other players who try to punch

03:50.440 --> 03:52.000
them out of the corral.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.900
Wario, you can say up, down, right, left, or scramble.

03:55.900 --> 03:56.900
We move and punch.

03:56.900 --> 03:57.900
Wait, am I directing the goombas?

03:57.900 --> 03:58.900
Yes.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.900
Okay.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.000
You have a horde of goombas that you want to kill us.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
What is it?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Up, down, right, left, and punch?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.640
Wait, you want to give them orders to keep them away from the fence.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.000
What were the terms, the directions, and what was the other one?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Let's see.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh god.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Up, down, right, left, and scramble.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Goombas won't listen to orders while they're moving.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Wait until they stop before giving them another command.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
You want to keep them in, we want to punch them out of the corral.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
If you guys can hear what I'm saying, that's kind of...

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Up, down, left, right, and scramble.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Fun is what that is.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
All right.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Fun is what they call that.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
This is a really...

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, I think you have to push the button on the mic as well.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
This looks like Big Boss's Isagar.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
All right, here we go.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Down.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Do I have to get all of them?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Left.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
It's working.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Right.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Scramble.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Down.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Down.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
No, down.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Down, you fuckers.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Right.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Right.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Up.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
They're going right.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Scramble.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Scramble.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Scramble.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Right.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Down.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Almost got it.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Down.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Up.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Up.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Up.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Up.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Up.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Down.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Down.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Down.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Down.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Down.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Whoo!

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Look at that little dickhead.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Goddammit.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
This game's awesome.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Fuck.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Huh.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Goddammit!

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Of course I do.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Dan, you should maybe move off that space.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
I want to fucking move off that space.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Are you kidding me?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Oh, no.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's fine.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh, no!

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
It's fine.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
We're just building the Rocky story here.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I want the fire.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
We're just building the underdog story.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
All right.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Fuck.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Oh, fuck me!

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
What a piece of shit.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah!

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Fuck this car, man.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
It is a piece of shit.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Goddammit.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Now do you eat the space that you landed on, or?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I don't know.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I think you go to Bowser's space, too.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yep.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Give him back, Bowser.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Waluigi's always been good to Bowser.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Wait.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Wait.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
We got it.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
You get that?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
We got it.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I thought we did a good job.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Finish!

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
See, I got a dominatrix printer.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Did you say dominatrix printer?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
It's my dream.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I don't know how that works, really.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
I'll show you.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Do you refer to your printer as daddy?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
No, it's the network name.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I did not refer to it.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I'm not allowed to.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
You always speak to your printer when spoken to.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Tells me the printhead is broken and that I'm a failure for not preparing it.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
And then I lick the cartridge for an hour.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
It tells you how very bad you are at maintaining a printer.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
So, so bad.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
This seems like a real video game here.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Little Koopa Raptors.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Fire.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
That takes forever.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Laser.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Laser.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Laser.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Okay.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Missile.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Missile.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
This is so good.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Drop bombs.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
So just the little green things we're trying to...

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Fire.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
What green things?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
There's little green things on top of his, like to the right and left of him.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Missile.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
They're only on the right now.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Missile.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Fire.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Laser.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Laser.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Laser.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Missile.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Fire.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Laser.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Mario, it's up to you.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Laser.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Cool boy.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Mario, you've played a lot of shooters.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Arcade shooters.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
You can do this.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Fire.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
No time limit.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Drop bombs.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
I got one more to get, Jeff.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Look out for fire.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Look out for fire.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Laser.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
What the fuck?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Get out of the way.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yes.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
So it's not the shadows.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
What the fuck was with the bombs?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
The fire comes up afterwards.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I love this microphone.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
It's working for you.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Nothing but dodging, right?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, just move.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Really scary.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Eh.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
There's like a blast.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh boy.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Oh, you fucker.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
It's my way.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yes.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Okay.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Do we all lose all of our coins?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Oh, that would be awesome.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Wait, what?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Why are we all in cages?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
That would be great.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Because we're going to die.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
Is this the Temple of Doom scene?

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
This is your life and it's ending one Mario party at a time.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Why are you fucking kidding me?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I hope it's everyone.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Do we all lose?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Fucking Bowser.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Man, Bowser's the great equalizer.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Wow.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Fuck.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Same as lame.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
True.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
The Mario party mantra.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
They're all lame.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
It's impressive if you're the only player to choose that button.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Your platform will rise.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Ooh.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
You fucking.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Wow.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Man.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
And we're also not going to use all of the buttons on the controls.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Top tier mini game design going on in Mario Party 6.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
I don't know, what if we just had to even pick a button and if no one else picks it,

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
they win?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I don't know, man.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Don't look at my controller.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It's a psychological mind game.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Go.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Never guess what I picked.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yes.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I'm going to pick A.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I bet he's not going to pick A.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
He's lying.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
I picked A.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So did I because fuck you.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm going to pick A.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm done with you.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I like how much time they give you to pick a button.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Yes.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Dammit.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Oh god.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Jeff, what are you picking?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
A.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Yes.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Wait.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
We should stop both picking L.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I would say.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
We're good at that.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
We're really good at that.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Mind games.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Alright, yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Rock, paper, scissors for idiots.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I think this is a bad game.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Oh yeah?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Hiddifold.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Hiddifold.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
You're both right.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Choose one of the three ropes.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Whoever chooses correctly,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
swings to the platform with...

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So if neither of us swing to the platform,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
the fly guy will rescue one of us.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Sorry Drew.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
So randomness on randomness in that case.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Can't call it random.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Both of you play randomly,

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
but if you're bad at being random,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
we will randomly choose a winner.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Wait.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
This is what I'm hearing.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Very dramatic.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Finish!

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
This was a mistake.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Risk no reward.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Video games were a mistake.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Good names.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Good names.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Across the board.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Every one of these games.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
No.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Not really.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Because it's like fucking...

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I don't know.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
What are those names again?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Bill Hill.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I don't know.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Done.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Do you think they come up with a name

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
and then they make the mini game?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
What would Bill Hill be?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Bill Hill would be a fucking bunch

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
of bullet bill launchers,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
and then there's a fucking hill,

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
and you want to stay on the hill,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
but there's a bunch of fucking

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
bullet bills launching at you

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
to make it hard to fucking stay on the hill.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Alright, let's keep this going.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I think we can do this.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
What's the next mini game?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
You work at Nintendo, Jim.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Congratulations.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
You guys are Mario Party developers.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
In a perfect world,

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
we all could have shared

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
in screwing over Dan equally.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Don't worry, because now it's his turn.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Don't make the worst turn.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Waste one of his items.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Do it.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
He's going back.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Don't do it.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I don't want to do that.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
What are you doing?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Could you burn one and...

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Oh.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
That was a level of savagery

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I was not prepared for.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Of course.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Of course.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Oh wait, are you...

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Is that the same one Brad tried to do?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Fuck.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Fuck.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Yes, we are losing stars.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
That's a big number.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
That's a really big number.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah, but I mean, where's...

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I think I'm pretty far away.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
He's pretty far.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
You're like...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
That's a big roll.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
You're all the way in the top right corner

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
where the chomp is.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Am I?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Oh my God.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Wow.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I take all y'all's shit.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Man.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Holy shit.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
That was some run.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Dan, give me a sticker.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Here, I'll give you some money.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Hang on.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Oh, he's running.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
While he's running.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I guess we'll be right back.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Golly.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Jeez, man.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Got some stuff.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Wow.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
I'll say.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
We've been breaking in your absence.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
No.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
People said you were playing Waluigi

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
and that you chomped a star away from me.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
No, we didn't.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm with Twitter.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
People are no fun.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Bring snacks for everyone

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
and you guys have betrayed me.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
No actually.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
No.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
No.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
No.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
No.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
No.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
No.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
No.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
No.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
No.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
No.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Are you kidding me?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
No, actually these are not from me.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
I got a tweet from SkullPanda1 on Twitter

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
saying there should be snacks waiting for you guys

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
in the lobby.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
What?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
I don't know what this is.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Really?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
SkullPanda1.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Okay.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
This is my stuff.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Man.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
A lotta.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
It's a strawberry and a lime-arita.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Here's your Snickers.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Thanks.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
That's the stuff you bought.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
That's the stuff I bought.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
This is all SkullPanda1 here.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
I don't know what we got.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
I just feel like it's gonna be

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
just like a bag of fucking dog crap.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Here you go.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
For use with Mario Party.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
It's a bag of human skulls.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Oh boy.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Double Stuck Oreos.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Oh I see.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yes.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Oh no.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Yes.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Oh my god.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
What a pleasant surprise.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Jason?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Oh wow.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Wait, what?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
He knows Jason's order too.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Fuck.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Yes.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Jason into some pharmacies?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I'll take that.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Oh yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh yeah.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
I did not know that.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Oh man.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
And then whatever this stuff is.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Some fancy water.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't know.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Fancy water.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Perrier.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Perrier.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Oh my god.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
It's gonna be Oreos and nachos.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Slim cans.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Slim cans.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Throw the lime slim cans in there.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I don't think I've ever had Perrier before.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
It's sparkling water.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Is that it?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Wow.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Okay.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
All right.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Someone says Red Vines.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I say how high.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I'll have the Red Vine.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
That's probably about it though.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Not even heating up the cheese, huh?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Nah.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Fuck it.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Oh no.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Oh.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Oh.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Mm.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Mm-hmm.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Mm-hmm.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Mm-hmm.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Well, let's see that cheese.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Keep going.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It's a Mario party.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
I hate myself and want to die.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Fuck.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
That's no good.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Yeah?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
All right.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I get the mic.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Do I get it?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I get the mic.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Should I put like three Oreos in my mouth before we do the mic game?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Probably.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
This is my favorite air album.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I think I could do two safely.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
All right.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Let's read the rules and I'll put the Oreos in.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
One player speaks commands to reach the goal.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
The other three will try to hit them with a spiny.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
That's me.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Forward, move back.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I'm just back.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Right and left.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Forward, move back.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Right and left.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
You move the cursor and throw a spiny ball.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
So, okay.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
So I'm just standing there.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
All right.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
All right.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Are you ready?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Whoa.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Whoa.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Oh.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Oh.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Right.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Whoa.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Okay.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
Just a decent amount of lag there.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
Let's move back and forward.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Oh, man.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
You got a chain reaction?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Diana Reeves?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Warner Freeman, right?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Warner Freeman.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Anybody see that Point Break remake?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
No.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I think that kind of came and went.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I've never really been a bit...

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I was not a huge fan of the original Point Break.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I've never seen it.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I don't have a reverence for it the way some people do.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah, there seems to be a real like cult following around that movie.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
I dated the girl whose brother is named after Patrick Swayze from Point Break.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
All right.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Bodhi is her brother.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Wow.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
His parents must have really fucking sucked.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
That's his name is Bodhi.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
That's a fucking real like just...

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Nope.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
At a certain point playing this, I forget that we're actually like broadcasting this

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
to thousands of people.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Like it draws me in to that degree.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Yes.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I think that is a testament to the game.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
It is utterly riveting.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I think it's a testament to the game.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
And you're drinking.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Also true.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
My game.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Yes.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Hooray.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Give me that goddamn microphone.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Do you want to do the Oreo challenge?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
No.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
It worked great for me.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
What was that?

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
When you put two Oreos in your mouth and try to do this.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Is this fucking mine?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
This one is dumb.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Up, down, left, right, scramble.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
Hey, this is monkeys from Yoshi's Island.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
They eat the watermelons and you can steal it from them.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Left.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Go left.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
What do you mean?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
How do you punch?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Go right.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
You're just knocking them out.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Scramble.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Scramble.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
This is tough.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Go down.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I'm wasting all my time on one of them.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Go right.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Go up.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Now we're making progress.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Scramble.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Scramble.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Go down.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Oh, we got this.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Go right.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
We got this.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah, we got it.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Fuck.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Go up.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
I don't know.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Everyone take a goomba.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
No.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Everyone take a goomba.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Go down.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Fuck.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
I'm about to sprint for it.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Fuck this shit.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
You won.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Don't care.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
You're just joining us.

20:41.000 --> 20:47.000
We're entering the back third of...

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Yes.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
We could bring in commentary for one of these.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I'm Byron Saxton.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Stop.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Go.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Got some goombas.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Wow, you really only get one shot at that, huh?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Fuck.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
I say blue.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Man.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Most fucking asinine way to fucking count this shit.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Are you kidding me?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Wow.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Fuck you.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
You gotta pick up the mic, Jeff.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
You gotta press the button.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Bite my ass.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Alright, game, mic, game, mic, game.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Good.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Three unplayed mini-games and Poke Punch-out.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
That's...

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Poke Punch-out.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Poke Punch-out.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Poke Punch-out.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Poke Punch-out.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Fosse & Poke Punch-out.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Poke Punch-out was alright.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
That's fucking bullshit.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Memories?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Because that was the first one we did.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Fucked it.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Fuck you.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Oh man.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Oh my God.

22:10.000 --> 22:17.000
I feel like I should text my girlfriend and tell her not to make dinner because I ate

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
too many orios.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Hurray the 5s are dancin'.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
KellyHerox!

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Dancing 5s.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Whoo!

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Oh man.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I mean, Oreos are kind of like dinner.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
You have to hit a button.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Or you just want to watch the 5s dance.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Whoo!

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I mean, I'm okay with that.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
55 spaces.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Here we go.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
So your spaces, your bonus you got for being in last, puts you directly in front of a chain

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
jump hut.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Fuck that.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Wait.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
No.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
That.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
What the fuck is going on here?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
That's me taking your coins.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
That's what that is.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Everything that happened sucked.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Getting coined up.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Oh.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
What?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Mike.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Dang it.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Meh.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I guess that's my room.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
It's like it knows.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
What a shitty.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
Laser, missile, laser, drag your goombas, fire, drop bombs, fire goombas, laser, missile,

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
laser, laser, drop bombs, drop bombs, fire goomba, goomba goomba, fire, fire, laser, laser.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
All right.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
All right.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Great.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Awesome.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Well, we're done.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
You're a superstar.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
First of three.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I'm a star.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm a star.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I'm a star.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Great.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Yeah.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Thank you for putting the game on, Twilight and Broodbree.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
This is the final star count.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Just skip the score screen.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Yeah.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Completely.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Probably.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
I don't know.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Can you do Mike games?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Who's ready to go again?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I mean, fair or square?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Wow.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
What a day it's been.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Thanks everyone for joining us.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Wow.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
This has been really fantastic.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
I can only hope that you enjoyed watching this as much as we enjoyed playing it for you.
