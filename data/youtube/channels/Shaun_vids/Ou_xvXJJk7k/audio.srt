00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about something that's been bothering me for a while.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a particular contradiction, one that comes up over and over whenever trans people or trans issues

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,500
are mentioned either online or in the press by people who self-describe as gender critical.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
And I think I should start today by showing you an example of that contradiction.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
So, in June of 2020, author J.K. Rowling published a statement on her website titled

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,500
J.K. Rowling writes about her reasons for speaking out on sex and gender issues.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,500
And in that statement, Rowling explains why she decided to throw her weight behind the gender critical crowd.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,000
There's been a lot written and spoken about this statement, but I want to focus on one particular part of it right now,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and that is J.K. Rowling's description of Magdalene Burns.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Magdalene Burns was a British YouTuber who Rowling describes as

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,500
and didn't believe lesbians should be called bigots for not dating trans women with penises.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,500
And because of this, she says, when Rowling followed Burns on Twitter, she was subjected to abuse from trans activists.

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Rowling also talks several times about her concerns in her piece.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
She doesn't want to be, quote,

15
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,500
and she ends her piece with a request for empathy for the women whose, quote,

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,000
So, this is the framing. Magdalene Burns and women like her simply believe in the importance of biological sex.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,500
They just want their concerns to be heard and they don't want to be called bigots because of that.

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,000
And just because of those things, they and their supporters are bombarded with unwarranted social media abuse.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, even if we're trying to be as fair and objective as we can be here,

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
it has to be said that this framing looks rather one-sided, right?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,500
All the aggression and abuse is coming from just the one side in Rowling's view.

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,000
We are all meek angels with just a few concerns, but we're getting shouted down by completely unreasonable social media abusers, you know.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,500
So, let's examine this framing.

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Is how JK Rowling described Magdalene Burns accurate?

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,000
What was she actually like?

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, I imagine many of you will be familiar with her now-infamous blackface tweet

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
where she calls trans women, quote,

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,500
You see, Magdalene Burns was not passively voicing concerns.

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,000
She wasn't simply stating her opinion that biological sex is important.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,500
She spent her time attacking transgender identities, which she repeatedly declared were invalid.

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,000
In her YouTube videos, she consistently made a point of misgendering any trans person she mentioned,

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,500
and she was also more than willing to attempt to ally herself and her cause with figures on the far right.

33
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,500
She could be seen on Twitter sharing Breitbart news stories about then-neo-Nazi poster boy Milo Yiannopoulos,

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,000
praising him and asking for him to share her YouTube videos.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
She even defended Yiannopoulos after he was widely criticized as a result of condoning, in a podcast, child molestation.

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,500
As a side note here, Burns has also called what she considers trans activism to be a, quote,

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,500
which is utterly ludicrous when considered in contrast to her defense of a white nationalist

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
who said child sexual abuse could be a, quote,

39
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
That is what he said.

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,000
Burns could also be seen giving a platform to the controversial figure Posey Parker,

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
who we'll talk more about in a moment.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
She also had a habit of focusing on George Soros as the person who she claimed was

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
funding the EU transgender lobby, which is a little suspect,

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,500
especially considered in light of her willingness to pal around with racists.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
So, what's my point here?

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, there's a huge contradiction between the Magdalene Burns described by JK Rowling

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,500
and the Magdalene Burns who actually existed.

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I myself interacted with Magdalene several times on Twitter, and this is just my subjective view,

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,000
but she was consistently aggressive and unreasonable and someone who I thought was motivated

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
not by some concerns she had about single-sex spaces or a desire to protect her rights,

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
but by her hatred and disgust of trans people.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,500
You can't call people pathetic, sick, fuck, pervert, blackface actors and then say,

53
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Oh, sorry, I just believe in the importance of biological sex. I just have a few concerns.

54
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,000
So, where does this leave us with regards to JK Rowling and how she chose to portray Burns?

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, it would be premature to come to any conclusions right now, I think.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,500
After all, Magdalene Burns is only one person, so if we want to build a proper argument here,

57
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
we need some more evidence, I think.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,500
So, let's pick back up with Posey Parker.

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,500
So, Parker, also known as Kelly J. Keene-Minshall, is someone who thinks that

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
women who call themselves men should be sterilized, so that's the sort of person she is.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Parker is a controversial figure even within the gender-critical movement,

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,500
and something that happened very recently serves as a good example of why that is.

63
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
On Sunday, September 18th of this year, Parker organized an event called

64
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,000
Let Women Speak, which took place in Brighton.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,500
It featured gender-critical speakers talking about what they see as the dangers of what they call

66
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
and it also attracted a crowd of counter-protesters who turned up to protest the event.

67
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,500
But the event also attracted some other people, and these were far-right nationalists,

68
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,000
such as the Tommy Robinson-linked Hearts of Oak group who streamed the event live on the internet.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Posey Parker has defended including these groups as part of her events.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
She sees the issue of stopping so-called trans ideology as so important

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,500
that she's willing to welcome in anyone who agrees with her on that particular issue,

72
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,500
even if they also happen to be racist, homophobic, misogynist, or outright fascist.

73
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Parker is friendly with white supremacist YouTubers, she's appeared on Tucker Carlson,

74
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,000
and she herself has a history of making racist statements that, again,

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
is controversial even within the gender-critical movement.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Some gender-critical people refused to associate with her,

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,500
and the group Women's Place UK put out a statement explaining why they were cutting all links with Parker,

78
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
saying, quote,

79
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,000
Another person upset about the far-right infiltration of the gender-critical movement is Angela Wild,

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
member of the group Get the L Out, who viewers of my other videos will definitely remember.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is her alongside Rowling at a much-publicized lunch in a photograph

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,500
featuring many of the other prominent figures of the UK's anti-trans movement.

83
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Wild recently stated on Twitter,

84
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,000
It's one thing about being called far-right by the TRAs,

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,500
that's what she calls trans rights activists,

86
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,000
and laugh it off because, frankly, I'd rather cut both my legs off, I guess,

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,500
than accept Heritage Foundation money, an alliance with Matt Walsh,

88
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,000
or proclaim proudly that, on the issues, Trump is my man.

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,500
But when the far-right speaks at gender-critical events unchallenged,

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,000
we have no leg to stand on to tell them that's not true because, hey, it is true.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,500
Well, not in my name.

92
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
On the other hand, there are many prominent people within the anti-trans movement

93
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,500
who are supporting Parker, even despite her history of racism and her openness to working with the far-right.

94
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Returning to this image, we can see both Maya Forstater and Helen Joyce

95
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,000
standing on either side of Rowling there.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,500
They both attended Posey Parker's event.

97
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
This is them traveling to the event.

98
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,500
This is Helen Joyce at the event holding a cut-up Pride flag.

99
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
She's not gay herself, by the way.

100
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,500
And this is both Helen and Maya speaking at the event in clips uploaded by Hearts of Oak

101
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,000
to their Twitter account, HeartsOfOakUK.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So this event exposed something of a schism in the anti-trans movement.

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Some of them are happy to work with people like Posey Parker

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,500
and the far-right groups that she welcomes to her events, and some of them are not.

105
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,000
And there was much discussion on the issue in the wake of this event.

106
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
J.K. Rowling chose to weigh in by using her platform to condemn the protesters at the event.

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,500
Not the far-right presence inside the event, but the people who were there to protest the event.

108
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,000
Rowling's language is also offensive and absurd and incorrect.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,500
The protesters were howling at lesbians for not doing dick, apparently.

110
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
She also explains in the replies to her tweet that, quote,

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But J.K. Rowling seems to be a bit confused here to be charitable.

112
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This was not a lesbian event.

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The organizer, Posey Parker, is married to a man.

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Speaker Maya Forstater is married to a man.

115
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Speaker Helen Joyce is married to a man.

116
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,500
By their own definition of lesbian, they are certainly not lesbians,

117
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,000
and I doubt the men from the far-right groups present at the event identify as lesbians

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
to make a minor assumption there.

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,500
There were some lesbians at the event, I'm sure,

120
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,000
but there were also a bunch of straight, conservative homophobes.

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,500
Posey Parker herself has argued that the, quote,

122
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,500
is attempting to indoctrinate and groom children in a video titled

123
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Something else that needs to be mentioned here is Parker's association

124
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,000
with an American group called Hands Across the Aisle,

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,500
an organization that claims to want to unite radical feminists with conservative Christians

126
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,500
in order to oppose what they call gender identity ideology.

127
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Hands Across the Aisle was founded by Kaylee Triller and Emily Zinos,

128
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
both of whom oppose gay rights and campaign to outlaw abortion.

129
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Zinos attends anti-abortion rallies, as seen here,

130
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,000
and Triller writes anti-abortion articles like this one titled

131
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Hands Across the Aisle claims Posey Parker as a member.

132
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,000
Here she is meeting founder Emily Zinos,

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,500
and the group have posted fundraising campaigns in support of Parker

134
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,000
on both their Facebook page and their website.

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,500
So Parker is associated with, and has taken money from,

136
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,500
conservative anti-abortion campaigners in the US.

137
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,000
And this is something I want to highlight in particular here,

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,500
because of course the argument that the anti-trans crowd always used to defend their positions

139
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
is that they're acting in defense of women's rights.

140
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
They aren't attacking trans people,

141
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,500
they're simply defending the rights that feminism has won for women, they say.

142
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,500
But what does it mean for that claim when the person making it is working with,

143
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
and is funded by, conservative anti-abortion groups?

144
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,000
On a similar note, one of the speakers at the event I showed there was Maya Forstater.

145
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Here's another picture of her getting all chummy with Rowling there.

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And she says,

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So that's what Forstater is doing in her own words,

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
standing up for women's rights.

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,500
I mention this because Forstater is due to speak at another event very soon,

150
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
that being Law Fair, the use and abuse of law to fight for freedom.

151
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,500
That's an event being put on as part of the Battle of Ideas Festival by the group ADF-UK.

152
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,000
So, who are ADF-UK?

153
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, they're the UK branch of the US-based Alliance Defending Freedom.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
And to quote the Southern Poverty Law Center,

155
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
has defended state-sanctioned sterilization of trans people abroad,

156
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,500
has contended that LGBTQ people are more likely to engage in pedophilia,

157
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,000
and claims that a homosexual agenda will destroy Christianity and society.

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The ADF also campaigns to outlaw abortion.

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,500
Their website proclaims the overturning of Roe vs Wade as a victory,

160
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
and is generally just covered in anti-abortion rubbish.

161
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,000
The first president of the ADF was a man called Alan Sears,

162
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,500
who wrote a book called The Homosexual Agenda, the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today.

163
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,500
The second president of the ADF was attorney and Baptist minister Michael Farris,

164
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,500
who in 2003 wrote a legal brief arguing against the Supreme Court overturning sodomy laws

165
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
in the Lawrence v. Texas decision.

166
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,500
So, what is Maya Forstater doing speaking at an ADF event?

167
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,000
She claims to be standing up for women's rights,

168
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,500
but she's working with people who campaign to take those rights away.

169
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,500
They want to take away a woman's right to have an abortion.

170
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,000
If she's a lesbian, they want to take away her right to get married to anyone except a man.

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,500
And if she has sex with another woman, they want to send her to prison.

172
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Anyway, what about the other speaker at Posey Parker's event, Helen Joyce?

173
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Is she merely standing up for women's rights?

174
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Well, another person at the event was another Helen, Helen Staniland.

175
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,000
Now, Staniland hosts an online show called Wine with Women.

176
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That's wine spelled without an H there.

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And a few months ago, she had Helen Joyce on as a guest.

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Now, this interview caused quite a bit of alarm, and rightly so.

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,500
In it, Joyce openly talks about wanting to reduce the number of trans people.

180
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,000
All trans people, even if they are happily transitioned, she says,

181
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,500
are a problem for the world because they need what she calls special accommodations.

182
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,000
Every trans person is a difficulty, she says.

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,500
I watched this whole interview, and it was utterly horrible and very revealing.

184
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
The clarification that she wants to reduce the number of people who transition,

185
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,000
even if they are happily transitioned, is especially awful.

186
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And the talk about trans people being, quote,

187
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,500
difficulties who are problems for the world because they need special accommodations

188
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,000
just sounds like fascist eugenics rhetoric.

189
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,500
The first thing that came to mind for me, listening to this interview,

190
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
were those Nazi Party propaganda films about disabled people

191
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,000
that I watched as part of making my video on the bell curve.

192
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They, too, talked about groups of people as costly problems burdening the rest of society.

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This interview again put light to the claim that Joyce and her allies just have some concerns,

194
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
or just want to protect women's rights.

195
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,500
This is her on the offensive, talking about keeping down the number of trans people,

196
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,000
like they're some invasive pest or something.

197
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Moving on, let's talk about Alison Bailey, who's standing between Joyce and Forstater in the picture there.

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Bailey is someone who has also defended joining forces with bigots, and I quote,

199
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This is a...

200
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This is a danger and a struggle the likes of which none of us has ever known.

201
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Adhering to any given political or philosophical belief system is not the immediate priority.

202
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If I'm being attacked and someone's willing to come to my rescue,

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm not going to ask about their politics before welcoming their help.

204
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Don't worry, though, she doesn't personally condone bigotry.

205
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
She actually abhors it, she says, but just not enough to not welcome the help of racists and homophobes in her movement.

206
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Alison Bailey is one of the founders of the anti-trans group, LGB Alliance.

207
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Now, another founder of LGB Alliance is Bev Jackson,

208
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
who has defended working with the US-based right-wing think tank, the Heritage Foundation.

209
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I've mentioned the Heritage Foundation before in another video of mine because they were anti-sex education.

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The Heritage Foundation are the worst.

211
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
They're climate change deniers, they oppose gay marriage, they work to scale back voting rights,

212
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
they campaigned to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but Bev Jackson is open to working with them.

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And speaking of the Heritage Foundation, let's give a mention to Julie Bindel,

214
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the person on the lower right of the picture there.

215
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Julie Bindel is a journalist who frequently works with Heritage Foundation speaker Jennifer Lahl.

216
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
There's Lahl talking on a Heritage Foundation panel there, here she is on another panel,

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
here she is doing a talk with Julie Bindel, another talk with Julie Bindel,

218
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
here's a picture of them just hanging out.

219
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So it's safe to say that Julie Bindel is pretty obviously open to working with Heritage Foundation speakers,

220
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
so that's a plus one to open to working with anti-abortion groups there.

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And before we move on, I should point out one of Jennifer Lahl's fellow Heritage Foundation speakers,

222
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Gary Powell, seated next to her there.

223
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And just to bring things full circle here, Gary Powell used to work with the LGB Alliance.

224
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He was on their online comms team and responsible for updating their social media feeds.

225
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
All this makes me wonder about the people who earnestly believe in the LGB Alliance.

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You know, the people who take it at face value and trust that it's an organization that exists to defend gay rights.

227
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Do they ever think, for an organization that exists to support gay rights,

228
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the LGB Alliance sure seems friendly with people who work with the Heritage Foundation,

229
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
an organization that opposes gay rights.

230
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's strange, isn't it? It's a little suspect there. Not really what you'd expect.

231
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Anyway, next up, let's talk about Carolyn Farrow.

232
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Now, Farrow is someone who, earlier this year, tweeted out how she was feeling emotional

233
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
because her life has been, quote,

234
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
invaded by insane trans rights activists.

235
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Then she says she saw JK Rowling coming out fighting and she lost it,

236
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
to which Rowling replied,

237
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Kiss, kiss, kiss. What a lovely moment there.

238
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So, who is Carolyn Farrow, the person to whom Rowling is sending love and kisses?

239
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, Carolyn Farrow is the director of the UK branch of the organization, Citizen Go.

240
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So, who are Citizen Go?

241
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Now, if you've been paying attention to the rest of the video today,

242
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I doubt this revelation will be all that shocking to you,

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
but Citizen Go are a far-right, anti-abortion, anti-gay rights organization.

244
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Some originated in Spain and not the US, though, so that's a novelty, at least.

245
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Citizen Go have defended Russia's laws pertaining to so-called gay propaganda.

246
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They've campaigned against abortion in Kenya, where they astroturfed the debates online.

247
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They paid Kenyan people to tweet health disinformation and anti-abortion arguments.

248
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Farrow herself has written anti-abortion articles.

249
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
She's tweeted that homosexual acts are sinful.

250
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Here she is campaigning against a pride parade. You get the picture.

251
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Farrow is also notorious in Ireland for downplaying the Catholic Church's infant mass grave scandal.

252
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And as a side note here, Farrow is currently running a crowdfunder for her own legal fees through the Citizen Go site.

253
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
There are people who call themselves feminists, donating money to this organization.

254
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So, I want to talk about something in particular in relation to Farrow, and that is platform responsibility.

255
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's imagine a possibility. Maybe JK Rowling didn't know who Carolyn Farrow was.

256
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
She just saw someone praising her on Twitter and responded in kind,

257
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
inadvertently supporting an anti-abortion homophobe in front of her millions of followers.

258
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Now, that is lazy and irresponsible, but possible, maybe.

259
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But here's the thing. Following her tweet, hundreds of people immediately pointed out to Rowling who Farrow is,

260
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
providing every sort of evidence you can ask for.

261
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It made the news, this tweet. Forbes talked about this tweet.

262
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So, she knows now, doesn't she? But this tweet is still up.

263
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Rowling didn't delete this, even after being told who Farrow was and the sorts of things that Citizen Go are up to.

264
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Now, unfortunately, this is a pattern.

265
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
As another example, Rowling has praised the anti-trans work of self-described theocratic fascist Matt Walsh,

266
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
a man who is currently in hot water after an audio recording surfaced of him seeming totally cool

267
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
with adult men impregnating minors, so long as they also get married to them.

268
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Matt Walsh has also spoken in favor of arranged marriages.

269
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But even after a flood of complaints about her praise for a creepy fascist,

270
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
JK Rowling's tweet in support of his work remains online.

271
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Just a couple more examples, Rowling sent a nice reply to the account Literary Goon,

272
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
someone who had previously threatened to set those who believe in gender ideology on fire,

273
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
urinate on them, kill them, and bury them in the desert.

274
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Lots of people informed Rowling about that, but her reply to him remains.

275
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Dennis Kavanagh, writing on the account Jebadoo2,

276
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
was suspended from Twitter for saying that he preferred AIDS to the work of charities like Stonewall and Mermaids.

277
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When he returned to Twitter, JK Rowling was there to welcome him back,

278
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
even though she was told why he was suspended, and he himself claimed to

279
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
quote, stand by every word in her Twitter replies.

280
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He was later suspended again for threatening those charities and their friends,

281
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
saying he would quote, fucking nail you to a wall.

282
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Rowling was also told about this, of course, but again, ignored it.

283
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And we can't say that she doesn't see these replies,

284
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
because when people point these things out to her, she blocks them.

285
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
She blocked me for criticizing her in her Twitter replies,

286
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
so she is aware of all this, but ignores it, because she has to.

287
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
She wants to pretend that all social media abuse, all the death threats,

288
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
all the violent fantasies about setting people on fire and cutting them up and nailing them to things,

289
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
she wants to pretend that all that is solely originating from people critical of her and her allies.

290
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And in order to preserve that fantasy, she must deliberately overlook the abuse originating from inside her own camp.

291
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
She just quietly pretends not to notice it, and blocks anyone who points it out to her.

292
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The last person I want to talk about today is not one of JK Rowling's new friends,

293
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
but one of her old friends, Baroness Emma Nicholson.

294
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Rowling co-founded the Children's High Level Group charity with Nicholson way back in 2005,

295
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
but still jokes around with her making fun of trans people on Twitter.

296
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Emma Nicholson is a homophobic conservative politician who opposed same-sex marriage,

297
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
opposed lesbians being parents, supported Section 28,

298
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and she's proposed legislation to limit access to abortion.

299
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
As recently as two years ago, Nicholson could be seen arguing against same-sex marriage,

300
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
which saw her receiving much criticism, as well as being removed from her position with the Booker Prize Foundation.

301
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Nicholson has also, in the past, had her house protested by a lesbian activist group.

302
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Nicholson has also attended and given speeches at Posey Parker's events,

303
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
at one of which, at least, she stated her intention to get Posey Parker into Parliament.

304
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Emma Nicholson is a typical example of a bigot who's found that homophobia simply doesn't have the same level of open institutional support that it once had,

305
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and so now uses transphobia as a way to advance her bigotry.

306
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And I want to make something very clear here.

307
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Emma Nicholson is a politician, voting on and proposing actual laws.

308
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
She isn't your nan who just doesn't know all the PC words or whatever.

309
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
She has actual power that she has wielded to attempt to stop same-sex marriage and roll back abortion rights.

310
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And she's been welcomed into the gender-critical so-called feminist movement just because she's willing to be transphobic.

311
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
With this in mind, I want to think about J.K. Rowling's claim that she supports abortion and gay marriage.

312
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Twitter user Katie Montgomery prompted Rowling earlier this year to say that she has always supported abortion and gay marriage.

313
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But I wonder what that means in light of everything that we've talked about today.

314
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What does it mean to support abortion rights and gay marriage if you also support people who are working to outlaw those things?

315
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
If you're friends with politicians who introduce anti-abortion bills.

316
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Several groups we've talked about today actively campaign to take away abortion rights and gay marriage rights,

317
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and many people that J.K. Rowling supports either work for those groups directly or are open to working with them as part of an anti-trans movement.

318
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The transphobes are so desperate for allies in their crusade against trans people that some of them are willing to join up with groups who,

319
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
if they got their way, would force all women back into the kitchen and all gay women back into a closet in that kitchen.

320
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The anti-trans movement claim to only be protecting their rights,

321
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,000
but these are the very same rights that they're willing to risk by allying themselves with far-right reactionary movements that seek to take those rights away.

322
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
This alliance threatens women's rights far more than anything trans people are accused of doing,

323
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and it seems obvious to say this, but it reveals that this movement is not really about protecting women's rights,

324
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
but can only be about attacking trans rights.

325
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Unfortunately, the divide in the anti-trans movement between those open to working with conservatives and the far-right and those who are not

326
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
is being won by the people who are willing to do so.

327
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The people not willing to align themselves with racists, homophobes, and misogynists are being sidelined,

328
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and the ones who are are being left to run the ship.

329
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And this is who JK Rowling surrounds herself with.

330
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Literally surrounds herself with.

331
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Rowling herself has very recently shown where she stands on the issue.

332
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
She posted a picture of herself in a shirt criticizing Nicola Sturgeon for being a quote,

333
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
"'Destroyer of women's rights.'"

334
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Now this shirt is a design from Posey Parker's online store, which can be seen advertising the shirts under Rowling's tweet.

335
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Posey Parker, remember, throws rallies that fascist groups are openly welcome to attend.

336
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
She works with and is funded by an anti-abortion organization.

337
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
She thinks, quote, "'Women who call themselves men' should be sterilized."

338
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And JK Rowling is helping to advertise her t-shirts.

339
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So what's my point today?

340
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Is it that JK Rowling is a bad person?

341
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Well, not really, although she is.

342
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
My point today was to show the worrying links between the UK's anti-trans movement and far-right groups.

343
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
JK Rowling just happens to be right in the middle of all this.

344
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
If I had to make a concluding point about Rowling, it would be that she knows what she's doing.

345
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I think we've seen enough evidence today to fairly make that judgment.

346
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
When she shows kindness towards ultra-conservative bigots, she knows exactly what she's doing.

347
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
When she attacks and mischaracterizes the people who protest those ultra-conservative bigots, she knows exactly what she's doing.

348
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
She is a long-time friend of ultra-conservative bigots, after all. That's just who she is.

349
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And everything she says about respecting trans people and marching with them if they were discriminated against or whatever else is just a lie.

350
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
She's just a liar.

351
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The contradiction I mentioned at the start of the video isn't really a contradiction at all.

352
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's just a conscious misrepresentation of the anti-trans movement.

353
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And I'd like to end today by thinking again about Angela Wilde,

354
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
the person who said she was horrified about the gender-critical movement being handed over to the far-right.

355
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I'd like to have a brief word with anyone who has thus far supported the anti-trans movement,

356
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
but now, like Angela, has some concerns about all the racists and homophobes turning up.

357
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So, hello. Whatever you think trans people are up to, it has to be said that, objectively,

358
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
it is some small beans compared to the outlawing of abortion and the recriminalization of gay sex.

359
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Now, I'm not speaking for anyone but myself here, but trans people are not your enemies, trust me.

360
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But the Heritage Foundation, Citizen Go, the ADF, Hands Across the Aisle, and groups like them,

361
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
they are actually coming for your rights.

362
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
They have people working around the clock trying to undo the last century of feminism.

363
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Are you content to be used by them?

364
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Especially if you're not straight yourself, you're gonna be relegated to being the gay camouflage

365
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
for a bunch of straight conservative homophobes who work with the US religious right.

366
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Do you really think that they'd stop after pushing just trans people back in the closet?

367
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Of course they wouldn't.

368
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The moment you're done helping them push trans people in, you'll feel the hands on your back,

369
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
believe me. So, you know, get out now. That's my advice.

370
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
