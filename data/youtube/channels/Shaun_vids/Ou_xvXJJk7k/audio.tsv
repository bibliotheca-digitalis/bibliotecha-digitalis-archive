0	5000	Hello everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about something that's been bothering me for a while.
5000	11000	It's a particular contradiction, one that comes up over and over whenever trans people or trans issues
11000	16500	are mentioned either online or in the press by people who self-describe as gender critical.
16500	20500	And I think I should start today by showing you an example of that contradiction.
20500	26500	So, in June of 2020, author J.K. Rowling published a statement on her website titled
26500	31500	J.K. Rowling writes about her reasons for speaking out on sex and gender issues.
31500	37500	And in that statement, Rowling explains why she decided to throw her weight behind the gender critical crowd.
37500	43000	There's been a lot written and spoken about this statement, but I want to focus on one particular part of it right now,
43000	47000	and that is J.K. Rowling's description of Magdalene Burns.
47000	51000	Magdalene Burns was a British YouTuber who Rowling describes as
56500	61500	and didn't believe lesbians should be called bigots for not dating trans women with penises.
61500	68500	And because of this, she says, when Rowling followed Burns on Twitter, she was subjected to abuse from trans activists.
68500	72500	Rowling also talks several times about her concerns in her piece.
72500	74500	She doesn't want to be, quote,
78500	82500	and she ends her piece with a request for empathy for the women whose, quote,
87500	94000	So, this is the framing. Magdalene Burns and women like her simply believe in the importance of biological sex.
94000	99500	They just want their concerns to be heard and they don't want to be called bigots because of that.
99500	106000	And just because of those things, they and their supporters are bombarded with unwarranted social media abuse.
106000	110000	Now, even if we're trying to be as fair and objective as we can be here,
110000	114000	it has to be said that this framing looks rather one-sided, right?
114000	118500	All the aggression and abuse is coming from just the one side in Rowling's view.
118500	126000	We are all meek angels with just a few concerns, but we're getting shouted down by completely unreasonable social media abusers, you know.
126000	128500	So, let's examine this framing.
128500	132500	Is how JK Rowling described Magdalene Burns accurate?
132500	135000	What was she actually like?
135000	140000	Well, I imagine many of you will be familiar with her now-infamous blackface tweet
140000	142000	where she calls trans women, quote,
147000	150500	You see, Magdalene Burns was not passively voicing concerns.
150500	155000	She wasn't simply stating her opinion that biological sex is important.
155000	160500	She spent her time attacking transgender identities, which she repeatedly declared were invalid.
160500	166000	In her YouTube videos, she consistently made a point of misgendering any trans person she mentioned,
166000	171500	and she was also more than willing to attempt to ally herself and her cause with figures on the far right.
171500	178500	She could be seen on Twitter sharing Breitbart news stories about then-neo-Nazi poster boy Milo Yiannopoulos,
178500	182000	praising him and asking for him to share her YouTube videos.
182000	190000	She even defended Yiannopoulos after he was widely criticized as a result of condoning, in a podcast, child molestation.
190500	195500	As a side note here, Burns has also called what she considers trans activism to be a, quote,
197500	202500	which is utterly ludicrous when considered in contrast to her defense of a white nationalist
202500	205500	who said child sexual abuse could be a, quote,
207500	209500	That is what he said.
209500	214000	Burns could also be seen giving a platform to the controversial figure Posey Parker,
214000	216000	who we'll talk more about in a moment.
216000	221000	She also had a habit of focusing on George Soros as the person who she claimed was
221000	225000	funding the EU transgender lobby, which is a little suspect,
225000	229500	especially considered in light of her willingness to pal around with racists.
229500	231000	So, what's my point here?
231000	236000	Well, there's a huge contradiction between the Magdalene Burns described by JK Rowling
236000	239500	and the Magdalene Burns who actually existed.
239500	245500	I myself interacted with Magdalene several times on Twitter, and this is just my subjective view,
245500	250000	but she was consistently aggressive and unreasonable and someone who I thought was motivated
250000	256000	not by some concerns she had about single-sex spaces or a desire to protect her rights,
256000	259000	but by her hatred and disgust of trans people.
259000	264500	You can't call people pathetic, sick, fuck, pervert, blackface actors and then say,
264500	270500	Oh, sorry, I just believe in the importance of biological sex. I just have a few concerns.
270500	276000	So, where does this leave us with regards to JK Rowling and how she chose to portray Burns?
276000	280000	Well, it would be premature to come to any conclusions right now, I think.
280000	285500	After all, Magdalene Burns is only one person, so if we want to build a proper argument here,
285500	288000	we need some more evidence, I think.
288000	290500	So, let's pick back up with Posey Parker.
290500	295500	So, Parker, also known as Kelly J. Keene-Minshall, is someone who thinks that
296000	301000	women who call themselves men should be sterilized, so that's the sort of person she is.
301000	305000	Parker is a controversial figure even within the gender-critical movement,
305000	309500	and something that happened very recently serves as a good example of why that is.
309500	313500	On Sunday, September 18th of this year, Parker organized an event called
313500	316000	Let Women Speak, which took place in Brighton.
316000	321500	It featured gender-critical speakers talking about what they see as the dangers of what they call
322500	327500	and it also attracted a crowd of counter-protesters who turned up to protest the event.
327500	332500	But the event also attracted some other people, and these were far-right nationalists,
332500	338000	such as the Tommy Robinson-linked Hearts of Oak group who streamed the event live on the internet.
338000	342000	Posey Parker has defended including these groups as part of her events.
342000	346000	She sees the issue of stopping so-called trans ideology as so important
346000	350500	that she's willing to welcome in anyone who agrees with her on that particular issue,
350500	356500	even if they also happen to be racist, homophobic, misogynist, or outright fascist.
356500	361500	Parker is friendly with white supremacist YouTubers, she's appeared on Tucker Carlson,
361500	365000	and she herself has a history of making racist statements that, again,
365000	368000	is controversial even within the gender-critical movement.
368000	371000	Some gender-critical people refused to associate with her,
371000	376500	and the group Women's Place UK put out a statement explaining why they were cutting all links with Parker,
376500	377500	saying, quote,
386500	392000	Another person upset about the far-right infiltration of the gender-critical movement is Angela Wild,
392000	397000	member of the group Get the L Out, who viewers of my other videos will definitely remember.
397000	401000	This is her alongside Rowling at a much-publicized lunch in a photograph
401000	405500	featuring many of the other prominent figures of the UK's anti-trans movement.
405500	407500	Wild recently stated on Twitter,
421500	425000	It's one thing about being called far-right by the TRAs,
425000	427500	that's what she calls trans rights activists,
427500	432000	and laugh it off because, frankly, I'd rather cut both my legs off, I guess,
432000	435500	than accept Heritage Foundation money, an alliance with Matt Walsh,
435500	439000	or proclaim proudly that, on the issues, Trump is my man.
439000	442500	But when the far-right speaks at gender-critical events unchallenged,
442500	447000	we have no leg to stand on to tell them that's not true because, hey, it is true.
447000	448500	Well, not in my name.
448500	452500	On the other hand, there are many prominent people within the anti-trans movement
452500	458500	who are supporting Parker, even despite her history of racism and her openness to working with the far-right.
458500	462500	Returning to this image, we can see both Maya Forstater and Helen Joyce
462500	465000	standing on either side of Rowling there.
465000	467500	They both attended Posey Parker's event.
467500	469500	This is them traveling to the event.
469500	473500	This is Helen Joyce at the event holding a cut-up Pride flag.
473500	475500	She's not gay herself, by the way.
475500	480500	And this is both Helen and Maya speaking at the event in clips uploaded by Hearts of Oak
480500	483000	to their Twitter account, HeartsOfOakUK.
483000	487000	So this event exposed something of a schism in the anti-trans movement.
487000	490000	Some of them are happy to work with people like Posey Parker
490000	494500	and the far-right groups that she welcomes to her events, and some of them are not.
494500	498000	And there was much discussion on the issue in the wake of this event.
498000	504000	J.K. Rowling chose to weigh in by using her platform to condemn the protesters at the event.
504000	509500	Not the far-right presence inside the event, but the people who were there to protest the event.
509500	514000	Rowling's language is also offensive and absurd and incorrect.
514000	518500	The protesters were howling at lesbians for not doing dick, apparently.
518500	521500	She also explains in the replies to her tweet that, quote,
528000	532000	But J.K. Rowling seems to be a bit confused here to be charitable.
532000	534000	This was not a lesbian event.
534000	537000	The organizer, Posey Parker, is married to a man.
537000	540000	Speaker Maya Forstater is married to a man.
540000	542500	Speaker Helen Joyce is married to a man.
542500	546500	By their own definition of lesbian, they are certainly not lesbians,
546500	551000	and I doubt the men from the far-right groups present at the event identify as lesbians
551000	553000	to make a minor assumption there.
553000	555500	There were some lesbians at the event, I'm sure,
555500	559000	but there were also a bunch of straight, conservative homophobes.
559000	561500	Posey Parker herself has argued that the, quote,
562500	567500	is attempting to indoctrinate and groom children in a video titled
570500	573500	Something else that needs to be mentioned here is Parker's association
573500	576000	with an American group called Hands Across the Aisle,
576000	581500	an organization that claims to want to unite radical feminists with conservative Christians
581500	585500	in order to oppose what they call gender identity ideology.
585500	589500	Hands Across the Aisle was founded by Kaylee Triller and Emily Zinos,
589500	593500	both of whom oppose gay rights and campaign to outlaw abortion.
593500	596500	Zinos attends anti-abortion rallies, as seen here,
596500	600000	and Triller writes anti-abortion articles like this one titled
605500	608500	Hands Across the Aisle claims Posey Parker as a member.
608500	611000	Here she is meeting founder Emily Zinos,
611000	614500	and the group have posted fundraising campaigns in support of Parker
614500	617000	on both their Facebook page and their website.
617000	620500	So Parker is associated with, and has taken money from,
620500	624500	conservative anti-abortion campaigners in the US.
624500	627000	And this is something I want to highlight in particular here,
627000	631500	because of course the argument that the anti-trans crowd always used to defend their positions
631500	634500	is that they're acting in defense of women's rights.
634500	636500	They aren't attacking trans people,
636500	640500	they're simply defending the rights that feminism has won for women, they say.
640500	644500	But what does it mean for that claim when the person making it is working with,
644500	648500	and is funded by, conservative anti-abortion groups?
648500	653000	On a similar note, one of the speakers at the event I showed there was Maya Forstater.
653000	656000	Here's another picture of her getting all chummy with Rowling there.
656000	657000	And she says,
663000	666000	So that's what Forstater is doing in her own words,
666000	668000	standing up for women's rights.
668000	672500	I mention this because Forstater is due to speak at another event very soon,
672500	676500	that being Law Fair, the use and abuse of law to fight for freedom.
676500	682500	That's an event being put on as part of the Battle of Ideas Festival by the group ADF-UK.
682500	685000	So, who are ADF-UK?
685000	690000	Well, they're the UK branch of the US-based Alliance Defending Freedom.
690000	692500	And to quote the Southern Poverty Law Center,
703000	710000	has defended state-sanctioned sterilization of trans people abroad,
710000	714500	has contended that LGBTQ people are more likely to engage in pedophilia,
714500	719000	and claims that a homosexual agenda will destroy Christianity and society.
719000	722000	The ADF also campaigns to outlaw abortion.
722000	725500	Their website proclaims the overturning of Roe vs Wade as a victory,
725500	728500	and is generally just covered in anti-abortion rubbish.
728500	732000	The first president of the ADF was a man called Alan Sears,
732000	737500	who wrote a book called The Homosexual Agenda, the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today.
737500	742500	The second president of the ADF was attorney and Baptist minister Michael Farris,
742500	748500	who in 2003 wrote a legal brief arguing against the Supreme Court overturning sodomy laws
748500	750500	in the Lawrence v. Texas decision.
750500	754500	So, what is Maya Forstater doing speaking at an ADF event?
754500	757000	She claims to be standing up for women's rights,
757000	760500	but she's working with people who campaign to take those rights away.
760500	763500	They want to take away a woman's right to have an abortion.
763500	768000	If she's a lesbian, they want to take away her right to get married to anyone except a man.
768000	771500	And if she has sex with another woman, they want to send her to prison.
771500	775500	Anyway, what about the other speaker at Posey Parker's event, Helen Joyce?
775500	778500	Is she merely standing up for women's rights?
778500	782500	Well, another person at the event was another Helen, Helen Staniland.
782500	786000	Now, Staniland hosts an online show called Wine with Women.
786000	789000	That's wine spelled without an H there.
789000	792000	And a few months ago, she had Helen Joyce on as a guest.
792000	796000	Now, this interview caused quite a bit of alarm, and rightly so.
796000	800500	In it, Joyce openly talks about wanting to reduce the number of trans people.
800500	805000	All trans people, even if they are happily transitioned, she says,
805000	810500	are a problem for the world because they need what she calls special accommodations.
810500	814000	Every trans person is a difficulty, she says.
814000	818500	I watched this whole interview, and it was utterly horrible and very revealing.
818500	822500	The clarification that she wants to reduce the number of people who transition,
822500	826000	even if they are happily transitioned, is especially awful.
826000	828000	And the talk about trans people being, quote,
828000	832500	difficulties who are problems for the world because they need special accommodations
832500	835000	just sounds like fascist eugenics rhetoric.
835000	838500	The first thing that came to mind for me, listening to this interview,
838500	841500	were those Nazi Party propaganda films about disabled people
841500	845000	that I watched as part of making my video on the bell curve.
845000	850000	They, too, talked about groups of people as costly problems burdening the rest of society.
850000	855000	This interview again put light to the claim that Joyce and her allies just have some concerns,
855000	858000	or just want to protect women's rights.
858000	862500	This is her on the offensive, talking about keeping down the number of trans people,
862500	865000	like they're some invasive pest or something.
865000	871000	Moving on, let's talk about Alison Bailey, who's standing between Joyce and Forstater in the picture there.
871000	876000	Bailey is someone who has also defended joining forces with bigots, and I quote,
896000	897000	This is a...
898000	903000	This is a danger and a struggle the likes of which none of us has ever known.
903000	908000	Adhering to any given political or philosophical belief system is not the immediate priority.
908000	911000	If I'm being attacked and someone's willing to come to my rescue,
911000	915000	I'm not going to ask about their politics before welcoming their help.
915000	919000	Don't worry, though, she doesn't personally condone bigotry.
919000	926000	She actually abhors it, she says, but just not enough to not welcome the help of racists and homophobes in her movement.
926000	931000	Alison Bailey is one of the founders of the anti-trans group, LGB Alliance.
931000	934000	Now, another founder of LGB Alliance is Bev Jackson,
934000	939000	who has defended working with the US-based right-wing think tank, the Heritage Foundation.
939000	945000	I've mentioned the Heritage Foundation before in another video of mine because they were anti-sex education.
945000	947000	The Heritage Foundation are the worst.
947000	953000	They're climate change deniers, they oppose gay marriage, they work to scale back voting rights,
953000	959000	they campaigned to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but Bev Jackson is open to working with them.
959000	963000	And speaking of the Heritage Foundation, let's give a mention to Julie Bindel,
963000	966000	the person on the lower right of the picture there.
966000	971000	Julie Bindel is a journalist who frequently works with Heritage Foundation speaker Jennifer Lahl.
971000	976000	There's Lahl talking on a Heritage Foundation panel there, here she is on another panel,
976000	981000	here she is doing a talk with Julie Bindel, another talk with Julie Bindel,
981000	984000	here's a picture of them just hanging out.
984000	990000	So it's safe to say that Julie Bindel is pretty obviously open to working with Heritage Foundation speakers,
990000	995000	so that's a plus one to open to working with anti-abortion groups there.
995000	1000000	And before we move on, I should point out one of Jennifer Lahl's fellow Heritage Foundation speakers,
1000000	1003000	Gary Powell, seated next to her there.
1003000	1008000	And just to bring things full circle here, Gary Powell used to work with the LGB Alliance.
1008000	1013000	He was on their online comms team and responsible for updating their social media feeds.
1013000	1018000	All this makes me wonder about the people who earnestly believe in the LGB Alliance.
1018000	1025000	You know, the people who take it at face value and trust that it's an organization that exists to defend gay rights.
1025000	1030000	Do they ever think, for an organization that exists to support gay rights,
1030000	1034000	the LGB Alliance sure seems friendly with people who work with the Heritage Foundation,
1034000	1037000	an organization that opposes gay rights.
1037000	1043000	That's strange, isn't it? It's a little suspect there. Not really what you'd expect.
1043000	1046000	Anyway, next up, let's talk about Carolyn Farrow.
1046000	1050000	Now, Farrow is someone who, earlier this year, tweeted out how she was feeling emotional
1050000	1052000	because her life has been, quote,
1052000	1055000	invaded by insane trans rights activists.
1055000	1059000	Then she says she saw JK Rowling coming out fighting and she lost it,
1059000	1061000	to which Rowling replied,
1062000	1065000	Kiss, kiss, kiss. What a lovely moment there.
1065000	1070000	So, who is Carolyn Farrow, the person to whom Rowling is sending love and kisses?
1070000	1076000	Well, Carolyn Farrow is the director of the UK branch of the organization, Citizen Go.
1076000	1078000	So, who are Citizen Go?
1078000	1081000	Now, if you've been paying attention to the rest of the video today,
1081000	1084000	I doubt this revelation will be all that shocking to you,
1084000	1089000	but Citizen Go are a far-right, anti-abortion, anti-gay rights organization.
1089000	1093000	Some originated in Spain and not the US, though, so that's a novelty, at least.
1093000	1099000	Citizen Go have defended Russia's laws pertaining to so-called gay propaganda.
1099000	1104000	They've campaigned against abortion in Kenya, where they astroturfed the debates online.
1104000	1109000	They paid Kenyan people to tweet health disinformation and anti-abortion arguments.
1109000	1112000	Farrow herself has written anti-abortion articles.
1112000	1115000	She's tweeted that homosexual acts are sinful.
1115000	1119000	Here she is campaigning against a pride parade. You get the picture.
1119000	1125000	Farrow is also notorious in Ireland for downplaying the Catholic Church's infant mass grave scandal.
1125000	1131000	And as a side note here, Farrow is currently running a crowdfunder for her own legal fees through the Citizen Go site.
1131000	1137000	There are people who call themselves feminists, donating money to this organization.
1137000	1143000	So, I want to talk about something in particular in relation to Farrow, and that is platform responsibility.
1143000	1149000	Let's imagine a possibility. Maybe JK Rowling didn't know who Carolyn Farrow was.
1149000	1153000	She just saw someone praising her on Twitter and responded in kind,
1153000	1158000	inadvertently supporting an anti-abortion homophobe in front of her millions of followers.
1158000	1163000	Now, that is lazy and irresponsible, but possible, maybe.
1163000	1169000	But here's the thing. Following her tweet, hundreds of people immediately pointed out to Rowling who Farrow is,
1169000	1172000	providing every sort of evidence you can ask for.
1172000	1177000	It made the news, this tweet. Forbes talked about this tweet.
1177000	1182000	So, she knows now, doesn't she? But this tweet is still up.
1182000	1189000	Rowling didn't delete this, even after being told who Farrow was and the sorts of things that Citizen Go are up to.
1189000	1192000	Now, unfortunately, this is a pattern.
1192000	1199000	As another example, Rowling has praised the anti-trans work of self-described theocratic fascist Matt Walsh,
1199000	1205000	a man who is currently in hot water after an audio recording surfaced of him seeming totally cool
1205000	1210000	with adult men impregnating minors, so long as they also get married to them.
1210000	1214000	Matt Walsh has also spoken in favor of arranged marriages.
1214000	1218000	But even after a flood of complaints about her praise for a creepy fascist,
1218000	1222000	JK Rowling's tweet in support of his work remains online.
1222000	1227000	Just a couple more examples, Rowling sent a nice reply to the account Literary Goon,
1227000	1233000	someone who had previously threatened to set those who believe in gender ideology on fire,
1233000	1237000	urinate on them, kill them, and bury them in the desert.
1237000	1242000	Lots of people informed Rowling about that, but her reply to him remains.
1242000	1245000	Dennis Kavanagh, writing on the account Jebadoo2,
1245000	1251000	was suspended from Twitter for saying that he preferred AIDS to the work of charities like Stonewall and Mermaids.
1251000	1255000	When he returned to Twitter, JK Rowling was there to welcome him back,
1255000	1259000	even though she was told why he was suspended, and he himself claimed to
1259000	1262000	quote, stand by every word in her Twitter replies.
1262000	1266000	He was later suspended again for threatening those charities and their friends,
1266000	1269000	saying he would quote, fucking nail you to a wall.
1269000	1273000	Rowling was also told about this, of course, but again, ignored it.
1273000	1276000	And we can't say that she doesn't see these replies,
1276000	1280000	because when people point these things out to her, she blocks them.
1280000	1284000	She blocked me for criticizing her in her Twitter replies,
1284000	1288000	so she is aware of all this, but ignores it, because she has to.
1288000	1293000	She wants to pretend that all social media abuse, all the death threats,
1293000	1298000	all the violent fantasies about setting people on fire and cutting them up and nailing them to things,
1298000	1304000	she wants to pretend that all that is solely originating from people critical of her and her allies.
1304000	1311000	And in order to preserve that fantasy, she must deliberately overlook the abuse originating from inside her own camp.
1311000	1317000	She just quietly pretends not to notice it, and blocks anyone who points it out to her.
1317000	1321000	The last person I want to talk about today is not one of JK Rowling's new friends,
1321000	1325000	but one of her old friends, Baroness Emma Nicholson.
1325000	1331000	Rowling co-founded the Children's High Level Group charity with Nicholson way back in 2005,
1331000	1335000	but still jokes around with her making fun of trans people on Twitter.
1335000	1340000	Emma Nicholson is a homophobic conservative politician who opposed same-sex marriage,
1340000	1344000	opposed lesbians being parents, supported Section 28,
1344000	1347000	and she's proposed legislation to limit access to abortion.
1347000	1353000	As recently as two years ago, Nicholson could be seen arguing against same-sex marriage,
1353000	1359000	which saw her receiving much criticism, as well as being removed from her position with the Booker Prize Foundation.
1359000	1364000	Nicholson has also, in the past, had her house protested by a lesbian activist group.
1364000	1368000	Nicholson has also attended and given speeches at Posey Parker's events,
1368000	1373000	at one of which, at least, she stated her intention to get Posey Parker into Parliament.
1373000	1382000	Emma Nicholson is a typical example of a bigot who's found that homophobia simply doesn't have the same level of open institutional support that it once had,
1382000	1386000	and so now uses transphobia as a way to advance her bigotry.
1386000	1388000	And I want to make something very clear here.
1388000	1394000	Emma Nicholson is a politician, voting on and proposing actual laws.
1394000	1398000	She isn't your nan who just doesn't know all the PC words or whatever.
1398000	1405000	She has actual power that she has wielded to attempt to stop same-sex marriage and roll back abortion rights.
1405000	1411000	And she's been welcomed into the gender-critical so-called feminist movement just because she's willing to be transphobic.
1411000	1417000	With this in mind, I want to think about J.K. Rowling's claim that she supports abortion and gay marriage.
1417000	1424000	Twitter user Katie Montgomery prompted Rowling earlier this year to say that she has always supported abortion and gay marriage.
1424000	1429000	But I wonder what that means in light of everything that we've talked about today.
1429000	1436000	What does it mean to support abortion rights and gay marriage if you also support people who are working to outlaw those things?
1436000	1440000	If you're friends with politicians who introduce anti-abortion bills.
1440000	1445000	Several groups we've talked about today actively campaign to take away abortion rights and gay marriage rights,
1445000	1454000	and many people that J.K. Rowling supports either work for those groups directly or are open to working with them as part of an anti-trans movement.
1454000	1461000	The transphobes are so desperate for allies in their crusade against trans people that some of them are willing to join up with groups who,
1461000	1468000	if they got their way, would force all women back into the kitchen and all gay women back into a closet in that kitchen.
1468000	1472000	The anti-trans movement claim to only be protecting their rights,
1472000	1481000	but these are the very same rights that they're willing to risk by allying themselves with far-right reactionary movements that seek to take those rights away.
1481000	1486000	This alliance threatens women's rights far more than anything trans people are accused of doing,
1486000	1492000	and it seems obvious to say this, but it reveals that this movement is not really about protecting women's rights,
1492000	1495000	but can only be about attacking trans rights.
1495000	1503000	Unfortunately, the divide in the anti-trans movement between those open to working with conservatives and the far-right and those who are not
1503000	1506000	is being won by the people who are willing to do so.
1506000	1512000	The people not willing to align themselves with racists, homophobes, and misogynists are being sidelined,
1512000	1515000	and the ones who are are being left to run the ship.
1515000	1518000	And this is who JK Rowling surrounds herself with.
1518000	1520000	Literally surrounds herself with.
1520000	1524000	Rowling herself has very recently shown where she stands on the issue.
1524000	1529000	She posted a picture of herself in a shirt criticizing Nicola Sturgeon for being a quote,
1529000	1531000	"'Destroyer of women's rights.'"
1531000	1539000	Now this shirt is a design from Posey Parker's online store, which can be seen advertising the shirts under Rowling's tweet.
1540000	1545000	Posey Parker, remember, throws rallies that fascist groups are openly welcome to attend.
1545000	1549000	She works with and is funded by an anti-abortion organization.
1549000	1553000	She thinks, quote, "'Women who call themselves men' should be sterilized."
1553000	1557000	And JK Rowling is helping to advertise her t-shirts.
1557000	1559000	So what's my point today?
1559000	1562000	Is it that JK Rowling is a bad person?
1562000	1565000	Well, not really, although she is.
1565000	1571000	My point today was to show the worrying links between the UK's anti-trans movement and far-right groups.
1571000	1575000	JK Rowling just happens to be right in the middle of all this.
1575000	1580000	If I had to make a concluding point about Rowling, it would be that she knows what she's doing.
1580000	1584000	I think we've seen enough evidence today to fairly make that judgment.
1584000	1590000	When she shows kindness towards ultra-conservative bigots, she knows exactly what she's doing.
1590000	1598000	When she attacks and mischaracterizes the people who protest those ultra-conservative bigots, she knows exactly what she's doing.
1598000	1604000	She is a long-time friend of ultra-conservative bigots, after all. That's just who she is.
1604000	1612000	And everything she says about respecting trans people and marching with them if they were discriminated against or whatever else is just a lie.
1612000	1613000	She's just a liar.
1613000	1618000	The contradiction I mentioned at the start of the video isn't really a contradiction at all.
1618000	1622000	It's just a conscious misrepresentation of the anti-trans movement.
1622000	1626000	And I'd like to end today by thinking again about Angela Wilde,
1626000	1632000	the person who said she was horrified about the gender-critical movement being handed over to the far-right.
1632000	1637000	And I'd like to have a brief word with anyone who has thus far supported the anti-trans movement,
1637000	1643000	but now, like Angela, has some concerns about all the racists and homophobes turning up.
1643000	1649000	So, hello. Whatever you think trans people are up to, it has to be said that, objectively,
1649000	1656000	it is some small beans compared to the outlawing of abortion and the recriminalization of gay sex.
1656000	1661000	Now, I'm not speaking for anyone but myself here, but trans people are not your enemies, trust me.
1661000	1668000	But the Heritage Foundation, Citizen Go, the ADF, Hands Across the Aisle, and groups like them,
1668000	1671000	they are actually coming for your rights.
1671000	1676000	They have people working around the clock trying to undo the last century of feminism.
1676000	1679000	Are you content to be used by them?
1679000	1684000	Especially if you're not straight yourself, you're gonna be relegated to being the gay camouflage
1684000	1689000	for a bunch of straight conservative homophobes who work with the US religious right.
1689000	1694000	Do you really think that they'd stop after pushing just trans people back in the closet?
1694000	1696000	Of course they wouldn't.
1696000	1700000	The moment you're done helping them push trans people in, you'll feel the hands on your back,
1700000	1705000	believe me. So, you know, get out now. That's my advice.
1705000	1708000	Anyway, thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1708000	1713000	And thank you especially to all my supporters over on Patreon, some of whom are scrolling by right now.
