00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about something that's been bothering me for a while.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
It's a particular contradiction, one that comes up over and over whenever trans people or trans issues

00:11.000 --> 00:16.500
are mentioned either online or in the press by people who self-describe as gender critical.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.500
And I think I should start today by showing you an example of that contradiction.

00:20.500 --> 00:26.500
So, in June of 2020, author J.K. Rowling published a statement on her website titled

00:26.500 --> 00:31.500
J.K. Rowling writes about her reasons for speaking out on sex and gender issues.

00:31.500 --> 00:37.500
And in that statement, Rowling explains why she decided to throw her weight behind the gender critical crowd.

00:37.500 --> 00:43.000
There's been a lot written and spoken about this statement, but I want to focus on one particular part of it right now,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
and that is J.K. Rowling's description of Magdalene Burns.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Magdalene Burns was a British YouTuber who Rowling describes as

00:56.500 --> 01:01.500
and didn't believe lesbians should be called bigots for not dating trans women with penises.

01:01.500 --> 01:08.500
And because of this, she says, when Rowling followed Burns on Twitter, she was subjected to abuse from trans activists.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.500
Rowling also talks several times about her concerns in her piece.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.500
She doesn't want to be, quote,

01:18.500 --> 01:22.500
and she ends her piece with a request for empathy for the women whose, quote,

01:27.500 --> 01:34.000
So, this is the framing. Magdalene Burns and women like her simply believe in the importance of biological sex.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.500
They just want their concerns to be heard and they don't want to be called bigots because of that.

01:39.500 --> 01:46.000
And just because of those things, they and their supporters are bombarded with unwarranted social media abuse.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Now, even if we're trying to be as fair and objective as we can be here,

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
it has to be said that this framing looks rather one-sided, right?

01:54.000 --> 01:58.500
All the aggression and abuse is coming from just the one side in Rowling's view.

01:58.500 --> 02:06.000
We are all meek angels with just a few concerns, but we're getting shouted down by completely unreasonable social media abusers, you know.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.500
So, let's examine this framing.

02:08.500 --> 02:12.500
Is how JK Rowling described Magdalene Burns accurate?

02:12.500 --> 02:15.000
What was she actually like?

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Well, I imagine many of you will be familiar with her now-infamous blackface tweet

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
where she calls trans women, quote,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.500
You see, Magdalene Burns was not passively voicing concerns.

02:30.500 --> 02:35.000
She wasn't simply stating her opinion that biological sex is important.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.500
She spent her time attacking transgender identities, which she repeatedly declared were invalid.

02:40.500 --> 02:46.000
In her YouTube videos, she consistently made a point of misgendering any trans person she mentioned,

02:46.000 --> 02:51.500
and she was also more than willing to attempt to ally herself and her cause with figures on the far right.

02:51.500 --> 02:58.500
She could be seen on Twitter sharing Breitbart news stories about then-neo-Nazi poster boy Milo Yiannopoulos,

02:58.500 --> 03:02.000
praising him and asking for him to share her YouTube videos.

03:02.000 --> 03:10.000
She even defended Yiannopoulos after he was widely criticized as a result of condoning, in a podcast, child molestation.

03:10.500 --> 03:15.500
As a side note here, Burns has also called what she considers trans activism to be a, quote,

03:17.500 --> 03:22.500
which is utterly ludicrous when considered in contrast to her defense of a white nationalist

03:22.500 --> 03:25.500
who said child sexual abuse could be a, quote,

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
That is what he said.

03:29.500 --> 03:34.000
Burns could also be seen giving a platform to the controversial figure Posey Parker,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
who we'll talk more about in a moment.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
She also had a habit of focusing on George Soros as the person who she claimed was

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
funding the EU transgender lobby, which is a little suspect,

03:45.000 --> 03:49.500
especially considered in light of her willingness to pal around with racists.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.000
So, what's my point here?

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, there's a huge contradiction between the Magdalene Burns described by JK Rowling

03:56.000 --> 03:59.500
and the Magdalene Burns who actually existed.

03:59.500 --> 04:05.500
I myself interacted with Magdalene several times on Twitter, and this is just my subjective view,

04:05.500 --> 04:10.000
but she was consistently aggressive and unreasonable and someone who I thought was motivated

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
not by some concerns she had about single-sex spaces or a desire to protect her rights,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
but by her hatred and disgust of trans people.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.500
You can't call people pathetic, sick, fuck, pervert, blackface actors and then say,

04:24.500 --> 04:30.500
Oh, sorry, I just believe in the importance of biological sex. I just have a few concerns.

04:30.500 --> 04:36.000
So, where does this leave us with regards to JK Rowling and how she chose to portray Burns?

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Well, it would be premature to come to any conclusions right now, I think.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.500
After all, Magdalene Burns is only one person, so if we want to build a proper argument here,

04:45.500 --> 04:48.000
we need some more evidence, I think.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.500
So, let's pick back up with Posey Parker.

04:50.500 --> 04:55.500
So, Parker, also known as Kelly J. Keene-Minshall, is someone who thinks that

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
women who call themselves men should be sterilized, so that's the sort of person she is.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Parker is a controversial figure even within the gender-critical movement,

05:05.000 --> 05:09.500
and something that happened very recently serves as a good example of why that is.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.500
On Sunday, September 18th of this year, Parker organized an event called

05:13.500 --> 05:16.000
Let Women Speak, which took place in Brighton.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.500
It featured gender-critical speakers talking about what they see as the dangers of what they call

05:22.500 --> 05:27.500
and it also attracted a crowd of counter-protesters who turned up to protest the event.

05:27.500 --> 05:32.500
But the event also attracted some other people, and these were far-right nationalists,

05:32.500 --> 05:38.000
such as the Tommy Robinson-linked Hearts of Oak group who streamed the event live on the internet.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Posey Parker has defended including these groups as part of her events.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
She sees the issue of stopping so-called trans ideology as so important

05:46.000 --> 05:50.500
that she's willing to welcome in anyone who agrees with her on that particular issue,

05:50.500 --> 05:56.500
even if they also happen to be racist, homophobic, misogynist, or outright fascist.

05:56.500 --> 06:01.500
Parker is friendly with white supremacist YouTubers, she's appeared on Tucker Carlson,

06:01.500 --> 06:05.000
and she herself has a history of making racist statements that, again,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
is controversial even within the gender-critical movement.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Some gender-critical people refused to associate with her,

06:11.000 --> 06:16.500
and the group Women's Place UK put out a statement explaining why they were cutting all links with Parker,

06:16.500 --> 06:17.500
saying, quote,

06:26.500 --> 06:32.000
Another person upset about the far-right infiltration of the gender-critical movement is Angela Wild,

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
member of the group Get the L Out, who viewers of my other videos will definitely remember.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
This is her alongside Rowling at a much-publicized lunch in a photograph

06:41.000 --> 06:45.500
featuring many of the other prominent figures of the UK's anti-trans movement.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
Wild recently stated on Twitter,

07:01.500 --> 07:05.000
It's one thing about being called far-right by the TRAs,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.500
that's what she calls trans rights activists,

07:07.500 --> 07:12.000
and laugh it off because, frankly, I'd rather cut both my legs off, I guess,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.500
than accept Heritage Foundation money, an alliance with Matt Walsh,

07:15.500 --> 07:19.000
or proclaim proudly that, on the issues, Trump is my man.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.500
But when the far-right speaks at gender-critical events unchallenged,

07:22.500 --> 07:27.000
we have no leg to stand on to tell them that's not true because, hey, it is true.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.500
Well, not in my name.

07:28.500 --> 07:32.500
On the other hand, there are many prominent people within the anti-trans movement

07:32.500 --> 07:38.500
who are supporting Parker, even despite her history of racism and her openness to working with the far-right.

07:38.500 --> 07:42.500
Returning to this image, we can see both Maya Forstater and Helen Joyce

07:42.500 --> 07:45.000
standing on either side of Rowling there.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.500
They both attended Posey Parker's event.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.500
This is them traveling to the event.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.500
This is Helen Joyce at the event holding a cut-up Pride flag.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
She's not gay herself, by the way.

07:55.500 --> 08:00.500
And this is both Helen and Maya speaking at the event in clips uploaded by Hearts of Oak

08:00.500 --> 08:03.000
to their Twitter account, HeartsOfOakUK.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
So this event exposed something of a schism in the anti-trans movement.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Some of them are happy to work with people like Posey Parker

08:10.000 --> 08:14.500
and the far-right groups that she welcomes to her events, and some of them are not.

08:14.500 --> 08:18.000
And there was much discussion on the issue in the wake of this event.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
J.K. Rowling chose to weigh in by using her platform to condemn the protesters at the event.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.500
Not the far-right presence inside the event, but the people who were there to protest the event.

08:29.500 --> 08:34.000
Rowling's language is also offensive and absurd and incorrect.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.500
The protesters were howling at lesbians for not doing dick, apparently.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.500
She also explains in the replies to her tweet that, quote,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
But J.K. Rowling seems to be a bit confused here to be charitable.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
This was not a lesbian event.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
The organizer, Posey Parker, is married to a man.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Speaker Maya Forstater is married to a man.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.500
Speaker Helen Joyce is married to a man.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.500
By their own definition of lesbian, they are certainly not lesbians,

09:06.500 --> 09:11.000
and I doubt the men from the far-right groups present at the event identify as lesbians

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
to make a minor assumption there.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.500
There were some lesbians at the event, I'm sure,

09:15.500 --> 09:19.000
but there were also a bunch of straight, conservative homophobes.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.500
Posey Parker herself has argued that the, quote,

09:22.500 --> 09:27.500
is attempting to indoctrinate and groom children in a video titled

09:30.500 --> 09:33.500
Something else that needs to be mentioned here is Parker's association

09:33.500 --> 09:36.000
with an American group called Hands Across the Aisle,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.500
an organization that claims to want to unite radical feminists with conservative Christians

09:41.500 --> 09:45.500
in order to oppose what they call gender identity ideology.

09:45.500 --> 09:49.500
Hands Across the Aisle was founded by Kaylee Triller and Emily Zinos,

09:49.500 --> 09:53.500
both of whom oppose gay rights and campaign to outlaw abortion.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.500
Zinos attends anti-abortion rallies, as seen here,

09:56.500 --> 10:00.000
and Triller writes anti-abortion articles like this one titled

10:05.500 --> 10:08.500
Hands Across the Aisle claims Posey Parker as a member.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.000
Here she is meeting founder Emily Zinos,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.500
and the group have posted fundraising campaigns in support of Parker

10:14.500 --> 10:17.000
on both their Facebook page and their website.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.500
So Parker is associated with, and has taken money from,

10:20.500 --> 10:24.500
conservative anti-abortion campaigners in the US.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.000
And this is something I want to highlight in particular here,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.500
because of course the argument that the anti-trans crowd always used to defend their positions

10:31.500 --> 10:34.500
is that they're acting in defense of women's rights.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
They aren't attacking trans people,

10:36.500 --> 10:40.500
they're simply defending the rights that feminism has won for women, they say.

10:40.500 --> 10:44.500
But what does it mean for that claim when the person making it is working with,

10:44.500 --> 10:48.500
and is funded by, conservative anti-abortion groups?

10:48.500 --> 10:53.000
On a similar note, one of the speakers at the event I showed there was Maya Forstater.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Here's another picture of her getting all chummy with Rowling there.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
And she says,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
So that's what Forstater is doing in her own words,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
standing up for women's rights.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.500
I mention this because Forstater is due to speak at another event very soon,

11:12.500 --> 11:16.500
that being Law Fair, the use and abuse of law to fight for freedom.

11:16.500 --> 11:22.500
That's an event being put on as part of the Battle of Ideas Festival by the group ADF-UK.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.000
So, who are ADF-UK?

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Well, they're the UK branch of the US-based Alliance Defending Freedom.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.500
And to quote the Southern Poverty Law Center,

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
has defended state-sanctioned sterilization of trans people abroad,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.500
has contended that LGBTQ people are more likely to engage in pedophilia,

11:54.500 --> 11:59.000
and claims that a homosexual agenda will destroy Christianity and society.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
The ADF also campaigns to outlaw abortion.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.500
Their website proclaims the overturning of Roe vs Wade as a victory,

12:05.500 --> 12:08.500
and is generally just covered in anti-abortion rubbish.

12:08.500 --> 12:12.000
The first president of the ADF was a man called Alan Sears,

12:12.000 --> 12:17.500
who wrote a book called The Homosexual Agenda, the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today.

12:17.500 --> 12:22.500
The second president of the ADF was attorney and Baptist minister Michael Farris,

12:22.500 --> 12:28.500
who in 2003 wrote a legal brief arguing against the Supreme Court overturning sodomy laws

12:28.500 --> 12:30.500
in the Lawrence v. Texas decision.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.500
So, what is Maya Forstater doing speaking at an ADF event?

12:34.500 --> 12:37.000
She claims to be standing up for women's rights,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.500
but she's working with people who campaign to take those rights away.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.500
They want to take away a woman's right to have an abortion.

12:43.500 --> 12:48.000
If she's a lesbian, they want to take away her right to get married to anyone except a man.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.500
And if she has sex with another woman, they want to send her to prison.

12:51.500 --> 12:55.500
Anyway, what about the other speaker at Posey Parker's event, Helen Joyce?

12:55.500 --> 12:58.500
Is she merely standing up for women's rights?

12:58.500 --> 13:02.500
Well, another person at the event was another Helen, Helen Staniland.

13:02.500 --> 13:06.000
Now, Staniland hosts an online show called Wine with Women.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
That's wine spelled without an H there.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
And a few months ago, she had Helen Joyce on as a guest.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Now, this interview caused quite a bit of alarm, and rightly so.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.500
In it, Joyce openly talks about wanting to reduce the number of trans people.

13:20.500 --> 13:25.000
All trans people, even if they are happily transitioned, she says,

13:25.000 --> 13:30.500
are a problem for the world because they need what she calls special accommodations.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.000
Every trans person is a difficulty, she says.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.500
I watched this whole interview, and it was utterly horrible and very revealing.

13:38.500 --> 13:42.500
The clarification that she wants to reduce the number of people who transition,

13:42.500 --> 13:46.000
even if they are happily transitioned, is especially awful.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And the talk about trans people being, quote,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.500
difficulties who are problems for the world because they need special accommodations

13:52.500 --> 13:55.000
just sounds like fascist eugenics rhetoric.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.500
The first thing that came to mind for me, listening to this interview,

13:58.500 --> 14:01.500
were those Nazi Party propaganda films about disabled people

14:01.500 --> 14:05.000
that I watched as part of making my video on the bell curve.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
They, too, talked about groups of people as costly problems burdening the rest of society.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
This interview again put light to the claim that Joyce and her allies just have some concerns,

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
or just want to protect women's rights.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.500
This is her on the offensive, talking about keeping down the number of trans people,

14:22.500 --> 14:25.000
like they're some invasive pest or something.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
Moving on, let's talk about Alison Bailey, who's standing between Joyce and Forstater in the picture there.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
Bailey is someone who has also defended joining forces with bigots, and I quote,

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
This is a...

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
This is a danger and a struggle the likes of which none of us has ever known.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Adhering to any given political or philosophical belief system is not the immediate priority.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
If I'm being attacked and someone's willing to come to my rescue,

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm not going to ask about their politics before welcoming their help.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Don't worry, though, she doesn't personally condone bigotry.

15:19.000 --> 15:26.000
She actually abhors it, she says, but just not enough to not welcome the help of racists and homophobes in her movement.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
Alison Bailey is one of the founders of the anti-trans group, LGB Alliance.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Now, another founder of LGB Alliance is Bev Jackson,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
who has defended working with the US-based right-wing think tank, the Heritage Foundation.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
I've mentioned the Heritage Foundation before in another video of mine because they were anti-sex education.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
The Heritage Foundation are the worst.

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
They're climate change deniers, they oppose gay marriage, they work to scale back voting rights,

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
they campaigned to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but Bev Jackson is open to working with them.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
And speaking of the Heritage Foundation, let's give a mention to Julie Bindel,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
the person on the lower right of the picture there.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Julie Bindel is a journalist who frequently works with Heritage Foundation speaker Jennifer Lahl.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
There's Lahl talking on a Heritage Foundation panel there, here she is on another panel,

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
here she is doing a talk with Julie Bindel, another talk with Julie Bindel,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
here's a picture of them just hanging out.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
So it's safe to say that Julie Bindel is pretty obviously open to working with Heritage Foundation speakers,

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
so that's a plus one to open to working with anti-abortion groups there.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
And before we move on, I should point out one of Jennifer Lahl's fellow Heritage Foundation speakers,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Gary Powell, seated next to her there.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
And just to bring things full circle here, Gary Powell used to work with the LGB Alliance.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
He was on their online comms team and responsible for updating their social media feeds.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
All this makes me wonder about the people who earnestly believe in the LGB Alliance.

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
You know, the people who take it at face value and trust that it's an organization that exists to defend gay rights.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
Do they ever think, for an organization that exists to support gay rights,

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
the LGB Alliance sure seems friendly with people who work with the Heritage Foundation,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
an organization that opposes gay rights.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
That's strange, isn't it? It's a little suspect there. Not really what you'd expect.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Anyway, next up, let's talk about Carolyn Farrow.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
Now, Farrow is someone who, earlier this year, tweeted out how she was feeling emotional

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
because her life has been, quote,

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
invaded by insane trans rights activists.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Then she says she saw JK Rowling coming out fighting and she lost it,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
to which Rowling replied,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Kiss, kiss, kiss. What a lovely moment there.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
So, who is Carolyn Farrow, the person to whom Rowling is sending love and kisses?

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
Well, Carolyn Farrow is the director of the UK branch of the organization, Citizen Go.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
So, who are Citizen Go?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Now, if you've been paying attention to the rest of the video today,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
I doubt this revelation will be all that shocking to you,

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
but Citizen Go are a far-right, anti-abortion, anti-gay rights organization.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Some originated in Spain and not the US, though, so that's a novelty, at least.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
Citizen Go have defended Russia's laws pertaining to so-called gay propaganda.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
They've campaigned against abortion in Kenya, where they astroturfed the debates online.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
They paid Kenyan people to tweet health disinformation and anti-abortion arguments.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Farrow herself has written anti-abortion articles.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
She's tweeted that homosexual acts are sinful.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Here she is campaigning against a pride parade. You get the picture.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
Farrow is also notorious in Ireland for downplaying the Catholic Church's infant mass grave scandal.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
And as a side note here, Farrow is currently running a crowdfunder for her own legal fees through the Citizen Go site.

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
There are people who call themselves feminists, donating money to this organization.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
So, I want to talk about something in particular in relation to Farrow, and that is platform responsibility.

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
Let's imagine a possibility. Maybe JK Rowling didn't know who Carolyn Farrow was.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
She just saw someone praising her on Twitter and responded in kind,

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
inadvertently supporting an anti-abortion homophobe in front of her millions of followers.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
Now, that is lazy and irresponsible, but possible, maybe.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
But here's the thing. Following her tweet, hundreds of people immediately pointed out to Rowling who Farrow is,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
providing every sort of evidence you can ask for.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
It made the news, this tweet. Forbes talked about this tweet.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
So, she knows now, doesn't she? But this tweet is still up.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
Rowling didn't delete this, even after being told who Farrow was and the sorts of things that Citizen Go are up to.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Now, unfortunately, this is a pattern.

19:52.000 --> 19:59.000
As another example, Rowling has praised the anti-trans work of self-described theocratic fascist Matt Walsh,

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
a man who is currently in hot water after an audio recording surfaced of him seeming totally cool

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
with adult men impregnating minors, so long as they also get married to them.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Matt Walsh has also spoken in favor of arranged marriages.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
But even after a flood of complaints about her praise for a creepy fascist,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
JK Rowling's tweet in support of his work remains online.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
Just a couple more examples, Rowling sent a nice reply to the account Literary Goon,

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
someone who had previously threatened to set those who believe in gender ideology on fire,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
urinate on them, kill them, and bury them in the desert.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Lots of people informed Rowling about that, but her reply to him remains.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Dennis Kavanagh, writing on the account Jebadoo2,

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
was suspended from Twitter for saying that he preferred AIDS to the work of charities like Stonewall and Mermaids.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
When he returned to Twitter, JK Rowling was there to welcome him back,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
even though she was told why he was suspended, and he himself claimed to

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
quote, stand by every word in her Twitter replies.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
He was later suspended again for threatening those charities and their friends,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
saying he would quote, fucking nail you to a wall.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Rowling was also told about this, of course, but again, ignored it.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And we can't say that she doesn't see these replies,

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
because when people point these things out to her, she blocks them.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
She blocked me for criticizing her in her Twitter replies,

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
so she is aware of all this, but ignores it, because she has to.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
She wants to pretend that all social media abuse, all the death threats,

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
all the violent fantasies about setting people on fire and cutting them up and nailing them to things,

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
she wants to pretend that all that is solely originating from people critical of her and her allies.

21:44.000 --> 21:51.000
And in order to preserve that fantasy, she must deliberately overlook the abuse originating from inside her own camp.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
She just quietly pretends not to notice it, and blocks anyone who points it out to her.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
The last person I want to talk about today is not one of JK Rowling's new friends,

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
but one of her old friends, Baroness Emma Nicholson.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
Rowling co-founded the Children's High Level Group charity with Nicholson way back in 2005,

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
but still jokes around with her making fun of trans people on Twitter.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
Emma Nicholson is a homophobic conservative politician who opposed same-sex marriage,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
opposed lesbians being parents, supported Section 28,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
and she's proposed legislation to limit access to abortion.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
As recently as two years ago, Nicholson could be seen arguing against same-sex marriage,

22:33.000 --> 22:39.000
which saw her receiving much criticism, as well as being removed from her position with the Booker Prize Foundation.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
Nicholson has also, in the past, had her house protested by a lesbian activist group.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
Nicholson has also attended and given speeches at Posey Parker's events,

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
at one of which, at least, she stated her intention to get Posey Parker into Parliament.

22:53.000 --> 23:02.000
Emma Nicholson is a typical example of a bigot who's found that homophobia simply doesn't have the same level of open institutional support that it once had,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
and so now uses transphobia as a way to advance her bigotry.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And I want to make something very clear here.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
Emma Nicholson is a politician, voting on and proposing actual laws.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
She isn't your nan who just doesn't know all the PC words or whatever.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
She has actual power that she has wielded to attempt to stop same-sex marriage and roll back abortion rights.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
And she's been welcomed into the gender-critical so-called feminist movement just because she's willing to be transphobic.

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
With this in mind, I want to think about J.K. Rowling's claim that she supports abortion and gay marriage.

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
Twitter user Katie Montgomery prompted Rowling earlier this year to say that she has always supported abortion and gay marriage.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
But I wonder what that means in light of everything that we've talked about today.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
What does it mean to support abortion rights and gay marriage if you also support people who are working to outlaw those things?

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
If you're friends with politicians who introduce anti-abortion bills.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
Several groups we've talked about today actively campaign to take away abortion rights and gay marriage rights,

24:05.000 --> 24:14.000
and many people that J.K. Rowling supports either work for those groups directly or are open to working with them as part of an anti-trans movement.

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
The transphobes are so desperate for allies in their crusade against trans people that some of them are willing to join up with groups who,

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
if they got their way, would force all women back into the kitchen and all gay women back into a closet in that kitchen.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
The anti-trans movement claim to only be protecting their rights,

24:32.000 --> 24:41.000
but these are the very same rights that they're willing to risk by allying themselves with far-right reactionary movements that seek to take those rights away.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
This alliance threatens women's rights far more than anything trans people are accused of doing,

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
and it seems obvious to say this, but it reveals that this movement is not really about protecting women's rights,

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
but can only be about attacking trans rights.

24:55.000 --> 25:03.000
Unfortunately, the divide in the anti-trans movement between those open to working with conservatives and the far-right and those who are not

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
is being won by the people who are willing to do so.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
The people not willing to align themselves with racists, homophobes, and misogynists are being sidelined,

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
and the ones who are are being left to run the ship.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
And this is who JK Rowling surrounds herself with.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Literally surrounds herself with.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
Rowling herself has very recently shown where she stands on the issue.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
She posted a picture of herself in a shirt criticizing Nicola Sturgeon for being a quote,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
"'Destroyer of women's rights.'"

25:31.000 --> 25:39.000
Now this shirt is a design from Posey Parker's online store, which can be seen advertising the shirts under Rowling's tweet.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
Posey Parker, remember, throws rallies that fascist groups are openly welcome to attend.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
She works with and is funded by an anti-abortion organization.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
She thinks, quote, "'Women who call themselves men' should be sterilized."

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
And JK Rowling is helping to advertise her t-shirts.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
So what's my point today?

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Is it that JK Rowling is a bad person?

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
Well, not really, although she is.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
My point today was to show the worrying links between the UK's anti-trans movement and far-right groups.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
JK Rowling just happens to be right in the middle of all this.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
If I had to make a concluding point about Rowling, it would be that she knows what she's doing.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
I think we've seen enough evidence today to fairly make that judgment.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.000
When she shows kindness towards ultra-conservative bigots, she knows exactly what she's doing.

26:30.000 --> 26:38.000
When she attacks and mischaracterizes the people who protest those ultra-conservative bigots, she knows exactly what she's doing.

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
She is a long-time friend of ultra-conservative bigots, after all. That's just who she is.

26:44.000 --> 26:52.000
And everything she says about respecting trans people and marching with them if they were discriminated against or whatever else is just a lie.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
She's just a liar.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
The contradiction I mentioned at the start of the video isn't really a contradiction at all.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
It's just a conscious misrepresentation of the anti-trans movement.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
And I'd like to end today by thinking again about Angela Wilde,

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
the person who said she was horrified about the gender-critical movement being handed over to the far-right.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
And I'd like to have a brief word with anyone who has thus far supported the anti-trans movement,

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
but now, like Angela, has some concerns about all the racists and homophobes turning up.

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
So, hello. Whatever you think trans people are up to, it has to be said that, objectively,

27:29.000 --> 27:36.000
it is some small beans compared to the outlawing of abortion and the recriminalization of gay sex.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
Now, I'm not speaking for anyone but myself here, but trans people are not your enemies, trust me.

27:41.000 --> 27:48.000
But the Heritage Foundation, Citizen Go, the ADF, Hands Across the Aisle, and groups like them,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
they are actually coming for your rights.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
They have people working around the clock trying to undo the last century of feminism.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Are you content to be used by them?

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
Especially if you're not straight yourself, you're gonna be relegated to being the gay camouflage

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
for a bunch of straight conservative homophobes who work with the US religious right.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
Do you really think that they'd stop after pushing just trans people back in the closet?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Of course they wouldn't.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
The moment you're done helping them push trans people in, you'll feel the hands on your back,

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
believe me. So, you know, get out now. That's my advice.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
And thank you especially to all my supporters over on Patreon, some of whom are scrolling by right now.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
So, thanks a lot for watching today, folks. I'll see you next time.
