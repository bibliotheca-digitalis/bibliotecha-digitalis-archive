00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about privatization,

00:04.400 --> 00:10.000
but more particularly about the difficulty of implementing the idea of privatization

00:10.000 --> 00:13.200
in a tightly controlled and regulated system.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.200
Now, fair warning here, this video is going to be relatively simple.

00:17.200 --> 00:22.000
Most of my regular viewers, I imagine, will already know most of this stuff.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.600
But this video is going to be the first, I hope, of a larger, semi-regular series

00:27.600 --> 00:33.200
in which I'll be giving a basic overview of various problems with capitalist economies.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.800
So I think it's best if we start off with some simpler concepts

00:36.800 --> 00:40.400
with clear real-world examples we can point to.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.960
So we're going to be talking about privatization and nationalization today.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.000
And so we should explain what those are.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.760
And very quickly here, to privatize a national system

00:51.760 --> 00:55.440
means to take a system that is owned and operated nationally

00:55.440 --> 00:59.680
and transfer that ownership and operation to private organizations.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.520
And nationalization is, of course, the reverse of that,

01:03.520 --> 01:07.840
to bring privately owned and operated services under state control.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.680
And so what are the benefits of privatizing a service?

01:11.680 --> 01:17.360
Well, the on-paper best-case-scenario pitch for privatization is as follows.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.760
Nationalized services are bloated and slow.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.200
The lack of competition means that there's no direct incentive

01:25.200 --> 01:29.520
to cut costs or deliver better services, since they have a monopoly.

01:30.160 --> 01:34.080
Privatized services, on the other hand, have a need to compete

01:34.080 --> 01:38.560
and therefore will offer the best service they can at the best price they can

01:38.560 --> 01:41.120
in order to maintain their share of the market.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.720
Privatization drives down operating costs

01:44.720 --> 01:49.760
and results in a blossoming of innovation and healthy profit-driven competition.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.360
That's what they say, anyway.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.280
This ideal runs into not insignificant problems

01:55.280 --> 01:58.240
when being brought into reality, however.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.080
And that's what we're going to talk about today.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.600
Now, I could just list all of the negative results

02:03.600 --> 02:06.640
of the privatization of British Rail right here,

02:06.640 --> 02:08.480
but that wouldn't be enough, really.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.840
We'll get to those later on.

02:10.480 --> 02:15.520
For now, with an eye towards the benefits of privatization that I just mentioned,

02:15.520 --> 02:19.280
how would you go about privatizing a rail network?

02:19.280 --> 02:22.880
So first off, let's think about the trains themselves.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.120
It's a good place to start as any, I suppose.

02:25.920 --> 02:30.080
The trains in the UK are not owned by the companies that run the trains,

02:30.080 --> 02:31.680
you might be surprised to hear.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.280
They're owned by what are called rolling stock companies,

02:35.280 --> 02:39.360
and these companies lease the trains to the train operating companies.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.720
And what's the problem with that, you might be thinking?

02:42.720 --> 02:46.640
That's just yet another wonderful level of free market choice.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.440
If the operating companies have different competing leasing companies

02:51.440 --> 02:54.640
vying to be the ones to lease the trains to them,

02:54.640 --> 02:57.920
that'll drive down costs and increase innovation

02:57.920 --> 03:02.400
and all the other things that are so great about privatization in theory, right?

03:03.120 --> 03:07.120
Well, it's a nice idea, but only that, unfortunately.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.600
The main problem here is that certain trains

03:09.600 --> 03:12.880
only work on certain parts of the rail network.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.440
There's no point in leasing high-speed trains

03:15.440 --> 03:17.920
if you only operate a small part of the network

03:17.920 --> 03:20.960
where those trains could never get up to full speed.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.880
If you own a high-speed track,

03:22.880 --> 03:26.880
there's no point running slow trains down it as they'll block the whole system.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.680
There's no point leasing big freight trains if you operate a passenger line.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.360
Certain electric trains use a faired rail.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.760
Others use overhead power lines.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.400
And obviously, you don't want to be leasing electric trains

03:40.400 --> 03:43.920
if your company operates an unelectrified section of track.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.840
And even the various faired rail and overhead lines in the country

03:47.840 --> 03:50.320
have different power configurations.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.280
All this means that the train operating companies

03:53.280 --> 03:55.440
don't really have much of a choice.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.520
It would be pointless for them to lease trains

03:57.520 --> 04:00.480
that do not work on the sections of track that they control.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.080
You know, they pretty much have to lease the one type of train

04:04.080 --> 04:06.160
that they can use on their tracks.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.560
So, welcome to the free markets.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.800
But, by the way, you're only able to buy one specific thing.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.160
Next up, let's consider the tracks.

04:16.960 --> 04:20.160
So, how would you go about running competing services

04:20.160 --> 04:22.720
on a freshly privatized rail network?

04:23.520 --> 04:24.960
Now, I don't like to do this,

04:24.960 --> 04:27.040
but I'm gonna make an assumption here.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.840
I'm going to assume that everyone watching this,

04:30.560 --> 04:33.680
even the most libertarian-minded among us,

04:33.680 --> 04:36.560
understand why running competing train services

04:36.560 --> 04:41.360
down the same tracks with no oversight would be a bad idea.

04:41.360 --> 04:45.040
And I'll probably include some footage of trains running into each other here,

04:45.040 --> 04:47.920
just to make the point a little more emphatically.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.120
But, yes, trains are big, heavy metal objects

04:51.120 --> 04:56.400
that carry soft, squishy, unsecured humans around very fast.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.320
You can't just have some company decide to start operating a train

05:00.320 --> 05:03.840
between two points and slip one onto the rail network, you know?

05:04.720 --> 05:07.040
So, how do we get around this problem?

05:07.040 --> 05:11.760
Well, the system in place in the UK is that various train operating companies

05:11.760 --> 05:15.120
bid to operate services on certain routes.

05:15.120 --> 05:18.720
And then, once that service has been claimed for a certain period,

05:18.720 --> 05:21.920
the operating company runs it exclusively.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.320
Now, the big problem with this method of running things

05:24.320 --> 05:28.480
is that it makes local competition virtually impossible.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.200
And since competition is supposed to be a main feature

05:31.200 --> 05:34.320
of this free-market privatization thing,

05:34.320 --> 05:36.320
that's kind of a major bug there.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.960
But what about innovation?

05:39.680 --> 05:42.000
That's supposed to be the other main feature, of course.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.560
The profit motive will drive innovation.

05:45.120 --> 05:48.560
The private companies will take one look at all the inherent problems

05:48.560 --> 05:50.480
in running a privatized rail network,

05:50.480 --> 05:53.040
and they'll just innovate their way around it.

05:53.040 --> 05:58.080
You know, these Randian supermen will find whole new ways to operate rail lines,

05:58.080 --> 06:03.120
ways impossible to think of in a sluggish, lazy, nationalized system.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.920
Now, the big problem here, if you can call it a problem, is regulation.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.840
The rail network is very heavily regulated.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.920
The railway rulebook is thick with mandates and controls,

06:15.920 --> 06:17.440
and for a very good reason.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.400
Without them, lots of people die.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.440
You know, this isn't mere red tape.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.800
Anyone thinking about getting into the train operating game

06:26.800 --> 06:30.400
will have to comply with these rules exactly.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.240
So what's the result here?

06:32.240 --> 06:36.160
Well, we have a system where operating companies are locked into providing

06:36.160 --> 06:40.800
a very specific service in a specific area for a specific time

06:41.360 --> 06:45.200
with no possibility for local competition or innovation.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.480
We've created a local monopoly here.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.440
A series of local monopolies, in fact, which,

06:51.440 --> 06:54.400
besides being counter to the free-market ideas

06:54.480 --> 06:57.280
behind the privatization in the first place,

06:57.280 --> 07:00.080
create a few other wider problems as well.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.440
So let's talk about those.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.640
First of all, slowdown.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.760
Now, slowdown, I hear you cry in shock.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.120
I thought it was the bloated, nationalized system

07:11.120 --> 07:16.320
with no profit motive to cut costs and times that was subject to slowdown.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.640
You know, instead of making money,

07:18.640 --> 07:25.600
they only had the weak, pathetic motive of operating a good service that benefits society.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.480
And well, regardless of the validity of that sentiment,

07:29.040 --> 07:34.400
when talking about railways specifically, the privatized system is no better.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.880
And I'll throw you a couple of scenarios here.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.600
Let's say a country with a nationalized rail service

07:39.600 --> 07:42.960
funded by taxes needs to make some change to the system.

07:43.520 --> 07:48.080
This can be in terms of maintenance, replacing and upgrading tracks,

07:48.080 --> 07:54.400
closing or moving stations, implementing new regulations, you know, whatever.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.120
Now, since the system is controlled by the government,

07:57.120 --> 08:01.280
they can relatively simply just go ahead and make the changes.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.120
In a privatized system, however, making changes is much more complex.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.560
Because of the fragmented nature of the privatized network,

08:10.560 --> 08:13.440
implementing a change means the government interfacing

08:13.440 --> 08:16.720
with potentially dozens of different private companies

08:16.720 --> 08:19.520
all responsible for different parts of the system,

08:19.520 --> 08:25.200
and all motivated not by making the process go smoothly or quickly, but by profit.

08:25.200 --> 08:30.160
This unnecessary level of complexity makes what should be relatively simple changes

08:30.160 --> 08:34.080
cost far more and run for far longer than they need to.

08:34.080 --> 08:37.440
And this problem doesn't stop with the railways either.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.560
Trains are just one part of a national transport system

08:40.560 --> 08:45.840
and they factor into decisions made regarding airports, cars, buses, and so on.

08:46.400 --> 08:51.520
A new track construction between two cities could affect the road network, for instance.

08:51.520 --> 08:55.760
New train stops need to be integrated with bus and tram systems.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.640
You know, when deciding upon long-term developments and allocating funds for them,

09:00.640 --> 09:03.520
all these different systems need to be considered together.

09:04.240 --> 09:10.400
Cost and time overruns in the rail network ripple out and affect the transport network at large.

09:10.400 --> 09:14.800
So it's not looking too good there for our hypothetical rail network.

09:14.800 --> 09:18.560
But let's turn now to our real-world example, British Rail.

09:19.200 --> 09:24.080
What have been the effects of the British government privatizing British Rail?

09:24.080 --> 09:30.160
Well, firstly, as it stands, the UK's rail network is incredibly expensive.

09:30.160 --> 09:35.600
This is both on the consumer end, where we're subjected to constantly increasing fare rises.

09:36.400 --> 09:42.640
A book I read while writing this video called The Transport Debate by John Shaw and Ian Doherty

09:42.640 --> 09:48.160
notes that a Glasgow to Edinburgh season ticket costs as much as buying an equivalent pass in

09:48.160 --> 09:51.440
Germany for the entire rail network.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.640
But this costliness is also on the state end,

09:54.640 --> 09:59.440
where we now spend much more money subsidizing the private rail network

09:59.440 --> 10:03.760
than it ever cost to run British Rail in its entirety.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.520
Which is pretty amazing, isn't it?

10:05.520 --> 10:09.840
You know, all this free market competition was supposed to drive down costs,

10:09.840 --> 10:12.640
and instead we have rising fares and subsidies.

10:13.200 --> 10:18.480
The Transport Debate also notes that it's very telling that our method of privatizing our rail

10:18.480 --> 10:23.360
network has not been adopted by any other EU country that studied it.

10:23.360 --> 10:28.640
You know, as you'd imagine it would be if it led to a better service or decreased costs.

10:28.640 --> 10:34.080
Now a big part of the current cost to the taxpayer is the budget for network rail,

10:34.080 --> 10:37.120
and I should briefly explain just what network rail is.

10:37.920 --> 10:43.440
After the UK rail system was privatized, the infrastructure of Britain's railways,

10:43.440 --> 10:49.200
that is, the tracks, the signalling system, tunnels, bridges and all that,

10:49.200 --> 10:54.960
it was all owned by Railtrack, which was a group of private companies created to oversee

10:54.960 --> 10:57.440
and maintain the rail infrastructure.

10:57.520 --> 11:03.040
I'm talking about Railtrack in the past tense here because, to make a long story short,

11:03.040 --> 11:06.640
they were rubbish at their jobs and they kept crashing the trains.

11:07.280 --> 11:11.440
Maintaining a rail network is a difficult and expensive undertaking,

11:11.440 --> 11:14.160
and Railtrack failed spectacularly,

11:14.800 --> 11:21.600
most publicly in the wake of the Hatfield rail crash on 17th of October of the year 2000,

11:21.600 --> 11:24.720
which killed four people and injured more than 70.

11:25.440 --> 11:31.040
The subsequent nationwide speed restrictions, safety inspections, rail replacements,

11:31.680 --> 11:37.360
not to mention the over 700 million pound bill for the costs and compensation associated

11:37.360 --> 11:42.960
with the Hatfield crash was the end of Railtrack, and it was replaced by Network Rail.

11:42.960 --> 11:47.200
Now, Network Rail is a nationalized company owned by the government,

11:47.200 --> 11:51.440
responsible for doing all the jobs that Railtrack was rubbish at.

11:51.520 --> 11:56.960
So, less than a decade after handing over the reins of railway management to private companies,

11:56.960 --> 12:00.320
the British government had to take them back in shame.

12:00.960 --> 12:05.600
The British taxpayer now pays through government subsidies to maintain the system

12:05.600 --> 12:10.400
on which the private companies run overpriced trains, all for their own profit.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.840
It's a pretty good swindle they have going on, to be honest.

12:14.560 --> 12:19.440
And perhaps the most shameful aspect to all this is that several of these companies

12:19.440 --> 12:25.280
running overpriced British trains in the UK are foreign state-owned train companies.

12:25.280 --> 12:31.120
For example, the trains that I regularly take from the station near my house are ran by Mersey Rail,

12:31.120 --> 12:39.760
which is a company owned by Dutch state-owned rail transport company Nederlandse Spoorwegen.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.320
Yikes, I butchered that.

12:43.200 --> 12:48.320
Um, elsewhere, Areva trains are owned by German Deutsche Bahn.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.680
The French own a large part of Southern Rail.

12:52.320 --> 12:57.040
Southwestern Railway is partly owned by the MTR Corporation,

12:57.040 --> 13:01.120
also known as Hong Kong Railway Corporation Limited.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.600
There's no prizes for guessing where they're from.

13:03.600 --> 13:09.920
Under this system, millions of pounds are flowing out of our country via these foreign companies,

13:10.000 --> 13:16.400
understandably exploiting our totally ridiculous decision to privatize the rail network.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.800
So I have a question.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.840
The problems with privatization seem obvious.

13:21.840 --> 13:28.400
Railways are inherently uncompetitive, and there is no way to prevent local monopolies forming.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.840
So why was the system privatized in the first place?

13:31.840 --> 13:34.960
Now, I could just say money here and end the video.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.400
That would be pretty funny.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.640
But it's a little deeper than that, actually.

13:38.640 --> 13:43.520
The privatization of British Rail was just one part of an ideological push

13:43.520 --> 13:47.280
towards an idea of free market individualism,

13:47.280 --> 13:50.720
typical of the era of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.200
Which is why she got on Jen's wonderful thumbnail for this video,

13:55.200 --> 14:00.000
even though British Rail was actually privatized a few years later under John Major.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.840
It was privatization as ideology.

14:04.480 --> 14:08.160
Whether the changes actually made sense to implement or not

14:08.240 --> 14:09.920
didn't really matter.

14:09.920 --> 14:13.040
The individual is everything, and society...

14:14.080 --> 14:17.200
Well, society doesn't even exist, actually.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.720
Margaret Thatcher once said,

14:18.720 --> 14:21.600
There is no such thing as society.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.840
There are individual men and women, and there are families.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.520
Now, the problem with this line of thinking, obviously,

14:29.520 --> 14:31.120
is that it's a load of old shit.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.040
But it's not hard to see why people who think like that

14:35.040 --> 14:40.480
would be against public transportation and instead favor heavily the car.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.880
Yeah, which is very individualistic indeed.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.360
So that's my relatively obvious conclusion there.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.440
Privatizing the rail network was an ideologically driven attempt

14:51.440 --> 14:55.200
to enforce market conditions where they cannot exist.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.520
I'm hesitant to lay the blame at any one individual's feet, however,

14:59.520 --> 15:02.320
though there is a lot of blame to go around, you know.

15:02.320 --> 15:06.880
The Conservatives deserve blame for actually, you know, doing it.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.640
New Labour deserve blame for not undoing it.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.760
The rolling stock and train operating companies

15:13.760 --> 15:15.600
deserve their share of the blame as well.

15:16.160 --> 15:22.800
But there exists a larger problem than any one greedy CEO or corrupt politician,

15:22.800 --> 15:24.400
and it's a systemic problem.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.160
I've mentioned the profit motive a few times today,

15:28.160 --> 15:31.440
and that will probably factor into my next video in this vein.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.680
The need for private companies to profit and grow,

15:35.680 --> 15:39.120
and the need for the whole capitalist system to grow in turn,

15:39.840 --> 15:41.760
that deserves a closer look.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.400
Because as you run out of growth elsewhere,

15:44.400 --> 15:49.520
the privatization of public services starts to look more and more viable.

15:49.520 --> 15:54.160
So tune in next time where we'll be talking about capitalism's growth problem.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.480
Thanks a lot for watching everyone,

15:56.480 --> 16:00.000
and thanks for listening to me waffle about trains for a while.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.760
Another possible route for continuing the line of thought in this video,

16:03.760 --> 16:06.000
apart from talking about profit and growth,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.040
is to talk about the current state of the NHS,

16:09.040 --> 16:11.920
the UK's universal healthcare provider,

16:11.920 --> 16:16.960
which the current government is not so sneakily attempting to privatize,

16:16.960 --> 16:18.320
one slice at a time.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.800
So let me know what you think there.

16:20.800 --> 16:25.920
If you want more videos like this, shorter, more politics-oriented videos,

16:25.920 --> 16:26.480
let me know.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.080
Thanks as always to my supporters over on Patreon,

16:30.080 --> 16:32.080
who are all very nice.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.120
Look at all those amazing names there.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.640
So hop over and check out my Patreon if you like.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.440
Also you can send me a question on Curious Cat,

16:41.440 --> 16:46.080
or you could follow me on Twitter and retweet everything I ever say.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.160
That's it from me today folks.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.000
See you next time.
