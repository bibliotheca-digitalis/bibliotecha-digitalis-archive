00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about privatization,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,000
but more particularly about the difficulty of implementing the idea of privatization

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,200
in a tightly controlled and regulated system.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Now, fair warning here, this video is going to be relatively simple.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Most of my regular viewers, I imagine, will already know most of this stuff.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,600
But this video is going to be the first, I hope, of a larger, semi-regular series

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,200
in which I'll be giving a basic overview of various problems with capitalist economies.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
So I think it's best if we start off with some simpler concepts

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,400
with clear real-world examples we can point to.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,960
So we're going to be talking about privatization and nationalization today.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
And so we should explain what those are.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,760
And very quickly here, to privatize a national system

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
means to take a system that is owned and operated nationally

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,680
and transfer that ownership and operation to private organizations.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,520
And nationalization is, of course, the reverse of that,

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
to bring privately owned and operated services under state control.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
And so what are the benefits of privatizing a service?

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,360
Well, the on-paper best-case-scenario pitch for privatization is as follows.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,760
Nationalized services are bloated and slow.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,200
The lack of competition means that there's no direct incentive

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,520
to cut costs or deliver better services, since they have a monopoly.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,080
Privatized services, on the other hand, have a need to compete

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,560
and therefore will offer the best service they can at the best price they can

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,120
in order to maintain their share of the market.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
Privatization drives down operating costs

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,760
and results in a blossoming of innovation and healthy profit-driven competition.

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,360
That's what they say, anyway.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
This ideal runs into not insignificant problems

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,240
when being brought into reality, however.

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,080
And that's what we're going to talk about today.

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,600
Now, I could just list all of the negative results

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,640
of the privatization of British Rail right here,

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,480
but that wouldn't be enough, really.

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,840
We'll get to those later on.

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,520
For now, with an eye towards the benefits of privatization that I just mentioned,

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
how would you go about privatizing a rail network?

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,880
So first off, let's think about the trains themselves.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,120
It's a good place to start as any, I suppose.

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,080
The trains in the UK are not owned by the companies that run the trains,

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
you might be surprised to hear.

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
They're owned by what are called rolling stock companies,

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
and these companies lease the trains to the train operating companies.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,720
And what's the problem with that, you might be thinking?

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,640
That's just yet another wonderful level of free market choice.

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,440
If the operating companies have different competing leasing companies

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
vying to be the ones to lease the trains to them,

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,920
that'll drive down costs and increase innovation

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,400
and all the other things that are so great about privatization in theory, right?

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Well, it's a nice idea, but only that, unfortunately.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,600
The main problem here is that certain trains

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,880
only work on certain parts of the rail network.

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,440
There's no point in leasing high-speed trains

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,920
if you only operate a small part of the network

54
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,960
where those trains could never get up to full speed.

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,880
If you own a high-speed track,

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,880
there's no point running slow trains down it as they'll block the whole system.

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,680
There's no point leasing big freight trains if you operate a passenger line.

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,360
Certain electric trains use a faired rail.

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,760
Others use overhead power lines.

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
And obviously, you don't want to be leasing electric trains

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
if your company operates an unelectrified section of track.

62
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,840
And even the various faired rail and overhead lines in the country

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,320
have different power configurations.

64
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,280
All this means that the train operating companies

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,440
don't really have much of a choice.

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,520
It would be pointless for them to lease trains

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,480
that do not work on the sections of track that they control.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,080
You know, they pretty much have to lease the one type of train

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,160
that they can use on their tracks.

70
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,560
So, welcome to the free markets.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,800
But, by the way, you're only able to buy one specific thing.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
Next up, let's consider the tracks.

73
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,160
So, how would you go about running competing services

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,720
on a freshly privatized rail network?

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,960
Now, I don't like to do this,

76
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
but I'm gonna make an assumption here.

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,840
I'm going to assume that everyone watching this,

78
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,680
even the most libertarian-minded among us,

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
understand why running competing train services

80
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,360
down the same tracks with no oversight would be a bad idea.

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,040
And I'll probably include some footage of trains running into each other here,

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,920
just to make the point a little more emphatically.

83
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,120
But, yes, trains are big, heavy metal objects

84
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,400
that carry soft, squishy, unsecured humans around very fast.

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,320
You can't just have some company decide to start operating a train

86
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,840
between two points and slip one onto the rail network, you know?

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,040
So, how do we get around this problem?

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,760
Well, the system in place in the UK is that various train operating companies

89
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,120
bid to operate services on certain routes.

90
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
And then, once that service has been claimed for a certain period,

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,920
the operating company runs it exclusively.

92
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,320
Now, the big problem with this method of running things

93
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,480
is that it makes local competition virtually impossible.

94
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,200
And since competition is supposed to be a main feature

95
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,320
of this free-market privatization thing,

96
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
that's kind of a major bug there.

97
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,960
But what about innovation?

98
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
That's supposed to be the other main feature, of course.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
The profit motive will drive innovation.

100
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,560
The private companies will take one look at all the inherent problems

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,480
in running a privatized rail network,

102
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,040
and they'll just innovate their way around it.

103
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,080
You know, these Randian supermen will find whole new ways to operate rail lines,

104
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,120
ways impossible to think of in a sluggish, lazy, nationalized system.

105
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,920
Now, the big problem here, if you can call it a problem, is regulation.

106
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,840
The rail network is very heavily regulated.

107
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,920
The railway rulebook is thick with mandates and controls,

108
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,440
and for a very good reason.

109
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
Without them, lots of people die.

110
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,440
You know, this isn't mere red tape.

111
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,800
Anyone thinking about getting into the train operating game

112
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
will have to comply with these rules exactly.

113
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,240
So what's the result here?

114
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,160
Well, we have a system where operating companies are locked into providing

115
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
a very specific service in a specific area for a specific time

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,200
with no possibility for local competition or innovation.

117
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,480
We've created a local monopoly here.

118
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,440
A series of local monopolies, in fact, which,

119
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,400
besides being counter to the free-market ideas

120
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,280
behind the privatization in the first place,

121
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,080
create a few other wider problems as well.

122
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
So let's talk about those.

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,640
First of all, slowdown.

124
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,760
Now, slowdown, I hear you cry in shock.

125
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,120
I thought it was the bloated, nationalized system

126
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,320
with no profit motive to cut costs and times that was subject to slowdown.

127
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,640
You know, instead of making money,

128
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:25,600
they only had the weak, pathetic motive of operating a good service that benefits society.

129
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,480
And well, regardless of the validity of that sentiment,

130
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,400
when talking about railways specifically, the privatized system is no better.

131
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,880
And I'll throw you a couple of scenarios here.

132
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,600
Let's say a country with a nationalized rail service

133
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,960
funded by taxes needs to make some change to the system.

134
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,080
This can be in terms of maintenance, replacing and upgrading tracks,

135
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,400
closing or moving stations, implementing new regulations, you know, whatever.

136
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,120
Now, since the system is controlled by the government,

137
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,280
they can relatively simply just go ahead and make the changes.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,120
In a privatized system, however, making changes is much more complex.

139
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,560
Because of the fragmented nature of the privatized network,

140
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,440
implementing a change means the government interfacing

141
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,720
with potentially dozens of different private companies

142
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,520
all responsible for different parts of the system,

143
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,200
and all motivated not by making the process go smoothly or quickly, but by profit.

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,160
This unnecessary level of complexity makes what should be relatively simple changes

145
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,080
cost far more and run for far longer than they need to.

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,440
And this problem doesn't stop with the railways either.

147
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
Trains are just one part of a national transport system

148
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,840
and they factor into decisions made regarding airports, cars, buses, and so on.

149
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,520
A new track construction between two cities could affect the road network, for instance.

150
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,760
New train stops need to be integrated with bus and tram systems.

151
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,640
You know, when deciding upon long-term developments and allocating funds for them,

152
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,520
all these different systems need to be considered together.

153
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,400
Cost and time overruns in the rail network ripple out and affect the transport network at large.

154
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,800
So it's not looking too good there for our hypothetical rail network.

155
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,560
But let's turn now to our real-world example, British Rail.

156
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,080
What have been the effects of the British government privatizing British Rail?

157
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,160
Well, firstly, as it stands, the UK's rail network is incredibly expensive.

158
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,600
This is both on the consumer end, where we're subjected to constantly increasing fare rises.

159
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,640
A book I read while writing this video called The Transport Debate by John Shaw and Ian Doherty

160
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,160
notes that a Glasgow to Edinburgh season ticket costs as much as buying an equivalent pass in

161
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,440
Germany for the entire rail network.

162
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
But this costliness is also on the state end,

163
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,440
where we now spend much more money subsidizing the private rail network

164
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,760
than it ever cost to run British Rail in its entirety.

165
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,520
Which is pretty amazing, isn't it?

166
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,840
You know, all this free market competition was supposed to drive down costs,

167
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,640
and instead we have rising fares and subsidies.

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,480
The Transport Debate also notes that it's very telling that our method of privatizing our rail

169
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,360
network has not been adopted by any other EU country that studied it.

170
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,640
You know, as you'd imagine it would be if it led to a better service or decreased costs.

171
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,080
Now a big part of the current cost to the taxpayer is the budget for network rail,

172
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,120
and I should briefly explain just what network rail is.

173
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,440
After the UK rail system was privatized, the infrastructure of Britain's railways,

174
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,200
that is, the tracks, the signalling system, tunnels, bridges and all that,

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,960
it was all owned by Railtrack, which was a group of private companies created to oversee

176
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,440
and maintain the rail infrastructure.

177
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,040
I'm talking about Railtrack in the past tense here because, to make a long story short,

178
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,640
they were rubbish at their jobs and they kept crashing the trains.

179
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,440
Maintaining a rail network is a difficult and expensive undertaking,

180
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
and Railtrack failed spectacularly,

181
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,600
most publicly in the wake of the Hatfield rail crash on 17th of October of the year 2000,

182
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,720
which killed four people and injured more than 70.

183
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,040
The subsequent nationwide speed restrictions, safety inspections, rail replacements,

184
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,360
not to mention the over 700 million pound bill for the costs and compensation associated

185
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,960
with the Hatfield crash was the end of Railtrack, and it was replaced by Network Rail.

186
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,200
Now, Network Rail is a nationalized company owned by the government,

187
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,440
responsible for doing all the jobs that Railtrack was rubbish at.

188
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,960
So, less than a decade after handing over the reins of railway management to private companies,

189
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,320
the British government had to take them back in shame.

190
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,600
The British taxpayer now pays through government subsidies to maintain the system

191
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,400
on which the private companies run overpriced trains, all for their own profit.

192
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,840
It's a pretty good swindle they have going on, to be honest.

193
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,440
And perhaps the most shameful aspect to all this is that several of these companies

194
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,280
running overpriced British trains in the UK are foreign state-owned train companies.

195
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:31,120
For example, the trains that I regularly take from the station near my house are ran by Mersey Rail,

196
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:39,760
which is a company owned by Dutch state-owned rail transport company Nederlandse Spoorwegen.

197
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,320
Yikes, I butchered that.

198
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,320
Um, elsewhere, Areva trains are owned by German Deutsche Bahn.

199
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,680
The French own a large part of Southern Rail.

200
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,040
Southwestern Railway is partly owned by the MTR Corporation,

201
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,120
also known as Hong Kong Railway Corporation Limited.

202
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,600
There's no prizes for guessing where they're from.

203
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,920
Under this system, millions of pounds are flowing out of our country via these foreign companies,

204
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,400
understandably exploiting our totally ridiculous decision to privatize the rail network.

205
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
So I have a question.

206
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,840
The problems with privatization seem obvious.

207
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,400
Railways are inherently uncompetitive, and there is no way to prevent local monopolies forming.

208
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,840
So why was the system privatized in the first place?

209
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Now, I could just say money here and end the video.

210
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,400
That would be pretty funny.

211
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,640
But it's a little deeper than that, actually.

212
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,520
The privatization of British Rail was just one part of an ideological push

213
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,280
towards an idea of free market individualism,

214
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,720
typical of the era of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.

215
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Which is why she got on Jen's wonderful thumbnail for this video,

216
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,000
even though British Rail was actually privatized a few years later under John Major.

217
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,840
It was privatization as ideology.

218
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,160
Whether the changes actually made sense to implement or not

219
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,920
didn't really matter.

220
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,040
The individual is everything, and society...

221
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,200
Well, society doesn't even exist, actually.

222
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,720
Margaret Thatcher once said,

223
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,600
There is no such thing as society.

224
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,840
There are individual men and women, and there are families.

225
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,520
Now, the problem with this line of thinking, obviously,

226
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,120
is that it's a load of old shit.

227
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,040
But it's not hard to see why people who think like that

228
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,480
would be against public transportation and instead favor heavily the car.

229
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,880
Yeah, which is very individualistic indeed.

230
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,360
So that's my relatively obvious conclusion there.

231
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,440
Privatizing the rail network was an ideologically driven attempt

232
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,200
to enforce market conditions where they cannot exist.

233
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,520
I'm hesitant to lay the blame at any one individual's feet, however,

234
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,320
though there is a lot of blame to go around, you know.

235
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,880
The Conservatives deserve blame for actually, you know, doing it.

236
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,640
New Labour deserve blame for not undoing it.

237
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,760
The rolling stock and train operating companies

238
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,600
deserve their share of the blame as well.

239
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,800
But there exists a larger problem than any one greedy CEO or corrupt politician,

240
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,400
and it's a systemic problem.

241
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,160
I've mentioned the profit motive a few times today,

242
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,440
and that will probably factor into my next video in this vein.

243
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,680
The need for private companies to profit and grow,

244
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,120
and the need for the whole capitalist system to grow in turn,

245
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,760
that deserves a closer look.

246
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,400
Because as you run out of growth elsewhere,

247
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,520
the privatization of public services starts to look more and more viable.

248
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,160
So tune in next time where we'll be talking about capitalism's growth problem.

249
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
Thanks a lot for watching everyone,

250
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
and thanks for listening to me waffle about trains for a while.

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,760
Another possible route for continuing the line of thought in this video,

252
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,000
apart from talking about profit and growth,

253
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,040
is to talk about the current state of the NHS,

254
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,920
the UK's universal healthcare provider,

255
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,960
which the current government is not so sneakily attempting to privatize,

256
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,320
one slice at a time.

257
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
So let me know what you think there.

258
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,920
If you want more videos like this, shorter, more politics-oriented videos,

259
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,480
let me know.

260
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,080

261
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
