0	4400	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about privatization,
4400	10000	but more particularly about the difficulty of implementing the idea of privatization
10000	13200	in a tightly controlled and regulated system.
13200	17200	Now, fair warning here, this video is going to be relatively simple.
17200	22000	Most of my regular viewers, I imagine, will already know most of this stuff.
22000	27600	But this video is going to be the first, I hope, of a larger, semi-regular series
27600	33200	in which I'll be giving a basic overview of various problems with capitalist economies.
33200	36800	So I think it's best if we start off with some simpler concepts
36800	40400	with clear real-world examples we can point to.
40400	44960	So we're going to be talking about privatization and nationalization today.
44960	48000	And so we should explain what those are.
48000	51760	And very quickly here, to privatize a national system
51760	55440	means to take a system that is owned and operated nationally
55440	59680	and transfer that ownership and operation to private organizations.
60240	63520	And nationalization is, of course, the reverse of that,
63520	67840	to bring privately owned and operated services under state control.
67840	71680	And so what are the benefits of privatizing a service?
71680	77360	Well, the on-paper best-case-scenario pitch for privatization is as follows.
78480	81760	Nationalized services are bloated and slow.
81760	85200	The lack of competition means that there's no direct incentive
85200	89520	to cut costs or deliver better services, since they have a monopoly.
90160	94080	Privatized services, on the other hand, have a need to compete
94080	98560	and therefore will offer the best service they can at the best price they can
98560	101120	in order to maintain their share of the market.
101680	104720	Privatization drives down operating costs
104720	109760	and results in a blossoming of innovation and healthy profit-driven competition.
109760	111360	That's what they say, anyway.
112000	115280	This ideal runs into not insignificant problems
115280	118240	when being brought into reality, however.
118240	120080	And that's what we're going to talk about today.
120880	123600	Now, I could just list all of the negative results
123600	126640	of the privatization of British Rail right here,
126640	128480	but that wouldn't be enough, really.
128480	129840	We'll get to those later on.
130480	135520	For now, with an eye towards the benefits of privatization that I just mentioned,
135520	139280	how would you go about privatizing a rail network?
139280	142880	So first off, let's think about the trains themselves.
142880	145120	It's a good place to start as any, I suppose.
145920	150080	The trains in the UK are not owned by the companies that run the trains,
150080	151680	you might be surprised to hear.
151680	155280	They're owned by what are called rolling stock companies,
155280	159360	and these companies lease the trains to the train operating companies.
160160	162720	And what's the problem with that, you might be thinking?
162720	166640	That's just yet another wonderful level of free market choice.
167280	171440	If the operating companies have different competing leasing companies
171440	174640	vying to be the ones to lease the trains to them,
174640	177920	that'll drive down costs and increase innovation
177920	182400	and all the other things that are so great about privatization in theory, right?
183120	187120	Well, it's a nice idea, but only that, unfortunately.
187120	189600	The main problem here is that certain trains
189600	192880	only work on certain parts of the rail network.
192880	195440	There's no point in leasing high-speed trains
195440	197920	if you only operate a small part of the network
197920	200960	where those trains could never get up to full speed.
200960	202880	If you own a high-speed track,
202880	206880	there's no point running slow trains down it as they'll block the whole system.
207680	211680	There's no point leasing big freight trains if you operate a passenger line.
212320	215360	Certain electric trains use a faired rail.
215360	217760	Others use overhead power lines.
217760	220400	And obviously, you don't want to be leasing electric trains
220400	223920	if your company operates an unelectrified section of track.
224480	227840	And even the various faired rail and overhead lines in the country
227840	230320	have different power configurations.
230320	233280	All this means that the train operating companies
233280	235440	don't really have much of a choice.
235440	237520	It would be pointless for them to lease trains
237520	240480	that do not work on the sections of track that they control.
241040	244080	You know, they pretty much have to lease the one type of train
244080	246160	that they can use on their tracks.
246160	248560	So, welcome to the free markets.
248560	252800	But, by the way, you're only able to buy one specific thing.
254000	256160	Next up, let's consider the tracks.
256960	260160	So, how would you go about running competing services
260160	262720	on a freshly privatized rail network?
263520	264960	Now, I don't like to do this,
264960	267040	but I'm gonna make an assumption here.
267040	269840	I'm going to assume that everyone watching this,
270560	273680	even the most libertarian-minded among us,
273680	276560	understand why running competing train services
276560	281360	down the same tracks with no oversight would be a bad idea.
281360	285040	And I'll probably include some footage of trains running into each other here,
285040	287920	just to make the point a little more emphatically.
287920	291120	But, yes, trains are big, heavy metal objects
291120	296400	that carry soft, squishy, unsecured humans around very fast.
296400	300320	You can't just have some company decide to start operating a train
300320	303840	between two points and slip one onto the rail network, you know?
304720	307040	So, how do we get around this problem?
307040	311760	Well, the system in place in the UK is that various train operating companies
311760	315120	bid to operate services on certain routes.
315120	318720	And then, once that service has been claimed for a certain period,
318720	321920	the operating company runs it exclusively.
321920	324320	Now, the big problem with this method of running things
324320	328480	is that it makes local competition virtually impossible.
328480	331200	And since competition is supposed to be a main feature
331200	334320	of this free-market privatization thing,
334320	336320	that's kind of a major bug there.
337040	338960	But what about innovation?
339680	342000	That's supposed to be the other main feature, of course.
342000	344560	The profit motive will drive innovation.
345120	348560	The private companies will take one look at all the inherent problems
348560	350480	in running a privatized rail network,
350480	353040	and they'll just innovate their way around it.
353040	358080	You know, these Randian supermen will find whole new ways to operate rail lines,
358080	363120	ways impossible to think of in a sluggish, lazy, nationalized system.
363120	367920	Now, the big problem here, if you can call it a problem, is regulation.
368640	371840	The rail network is very heavily regulated.
371840	375920	The railway rulebook is thick with mandates and controls,
375920	377440	and for a very good reason.
378080	380400	Without them, lots of people die.
381120	383440	You know, this isn't mere red tape.
383440	386800	Anyone thinking about getting into the train operating game
386800	390400	will have to comply with these rules exactly.
390400	392240	So what's the result here?
392240	396160	Well, we have a system where operating companies are locked into providing
396160	400800	a very specific service in a specific area for a specific time
401360	405200	with no possibility for local competition or innovation.
405200	408480	We've created a local monopoly here.
408480	411440	A series of local monopolies, in fact, which,
411440	414400	besides being counter to the free-market ideas
414480	417280	behind the privatization in the first place,
417280	420080	create a few other wider problems as well.
420080	421440	So let's talk about those.
422160	424640	First of all, slowdown.
424640	427760	Now, slowdown, I hear you cry in shock.
428400	431120	I thought it was the bloated, nationalized system
431120	436320	with no profit motive to cut costs and times that was subject to slowdown.
436320	438640	You know, instead of making money,
438640	445600	they only had the weak, pathetic motive of operating a good service that benefits society.
445600	448480	And well, regardless of the validity of that sentiment,
449040	454400	when talking about railways specifically, the privatized system is no better.
454400	456880	And I'll throw you a couple of scenarios here.
456880	459600	Let's say a country with a nationalized rail service
459600	462960	funded by taxes needs to make some change to the system.
463520	468080	This can be in terms of maintenance, replacing and upgrading tracks,
468080	474400	closing or moving stations, implementing new regulations, you know, whatever.
474400	477120	Now, since the system is controlled by the government,
477120	481280	they can relatively simply just go ahead and make the changes.
482000	487120	In a privatized system, however, making changes is much more complex.
487120	490560	Because of the fragmented nature of the privatized network,
490560	493440	implementing a change means the government interfacing
493440	496720	with potentially dozens of different private companies
496720	499520	all responsible for different parts of the system,
499520	505200	and all motivated not by making the process go smoothly or quickly, but by profit.
505200	510160	This unnecessary level of complexity makes what should be relatively simple changes
510160	514080	cost far more and run for far longer than they need to.
514080	517440	And this problem doesn't stop with the railways either.
517440	520560	Trains are just one part of a national transport system
520560	525840	and they factor into decisions made regarding airports, cars, buses, and so on.
526400	531520	A new track construction between two cities could affect the road network, for instance.
531520	535760	New train stops need to be integrated with bus and tram systems.
535760	540640	You know, when deciding upon long-term developments and allocating funds for them,
540640	543520	all these different systems need to be considered together.
544240	550400	Cost and time overruns in the rail network ripple out and affect the transport network at large.
550400	554800	So it's not looking too good there for our hypothetical rail network.
554800	558560	But let's turn now to our real-world example, British Rail.
559200	564080	What have been the effects of the British government privatizing British Rail?
564080	570160	Well, firstly, as it stands, the UK's rail network is incredibly expensive.
570160	575600	This is both on the consumer end, where we're subjected to constantly increasing fare rises.
576400	582640	A book I read while writing this video called The Transport Debate by John Shaw and Ian Doherty
582640	588160	notes that a Glasgow to Edinburgh season ticket costs as much as buying an equivalent pass in
588160	591440	Germany for the entire rail network.
591440	594640	But this costliness is also on the state end,
594640	599440	where we now spend much more money subsidizing the private rail network
599440	603760	than it ever cost to run British Rail in its entirety.
603760	605520	Which is pretty amazing, isn't it?
605520	609840	You know, all this free market competition was supposed to drive down costs,
609840	612640	and instead we have rising fares and subsidies.
613200	618480	The Transport Debate also notes that it's very telling that our method of privatizing our rail
618480	623360	network has not been adopted by any other EU country that studied it.
623360	628640	You know, as you'd imagine it would be if it led to a better service or decreased costs.
628640	634080	Now a big part of the current cost to the taxpayer is the budget for network rail,
634080	637120	and I should briefly explain just what network rail is.
637920	643440	After the UK rail system was privatized, the infrastructure of Britain's railways,
643440	649200	that is, the tracks, the signalling system, tunnels, bridges and all that,
649200	654960	it was all owned by Railtrack, which was a group of private companies created to oversee
654960	657440	and maintain the rail infrastructure.
657520	663040	I'm talking about Railtrack in the past tense here because, to make a long story short,
663040	666640	they were rubbish at their jobs and they kept crashing the trains.
667280	671440	Maintaining a rail network is a difficult and expensive undertaking,
671440	674160	and Railtrack failed spectacularly,
674800	681600	most publicly in the wake of the Hatfield rail crash on 17th of October of the year 2000,
681600	684720	which killed four people and injured more than 70.
685440	691040	The subsequent nationwide speed restrictions, safety inspections, rail replacements,
691680	697360	not to mention the over 700 million pound bill for the costs and compensation associated
697360	702960	with the Hatfield crash was the end of Railtrack, and it was replaced by Network Rail.
702960	707200	Now, Network Rail is a nationalized company owned by the government,
707200	711440	responsible for doing all the jobs that Railtrack was rubbish at.
711520	716960	So, less than a decade after handing over the reins of railway management to private companies,
716960	720320	the British government had to take them back in shame.
720960	725600	The British taxpayer now pays through government subsidies to maintain the system
725600	730400	on which the private companies run overpriced trains, all for their own profit.
730960	733840	It's a pretty good swindle they have going on, to be honest.
734560	739440	And perhaps the most shameful aspect to all this is that several of these companies
739440	745280	running overpriced British trains in the UK are foreign state-owned train companies.
745280	751120	For example, the trains that I regularly take from the station near my house are ran by Mersey Rail,
751120	759760	which is a company owned by Dutch state-owned rail transport company Nederlandse Spoorwegen.
761040	762320	Yikes, I butchered that.
763200	768320	Um, elsewhere, Areva trains are owned by German Deutsche Bahn.
768960	771680	The French own a large part of Southern Rail.
772320	777040	Southwestern Railway is partly owned by the MTR Corporation,
777040	781120	also known as Hong Kong Railway Corporation Limited.
781120	783600	There's no prizes for guessing where they're from.
783600	789920	Under this system, millions of pounds are flowing out of our country via these foreign companies,
790000	796400	understandably exploiting our totally ridiculous decision to privatize the rail network.
797120	798800	So I have a question.
798800	801840	The problems with privatization seem obvious.
801840	808400	Railways are inherently uncompetitive, and there is no way to prevent local monopolies forming.
808400	811840	So why was the system privatized in the first place?
811840	814960	Now, I could just say money here and end the video.
814960	816400	That would be pretty funny.
816400	818640	But it's a little deeper than that, actually.
818640	823520	The privatization of British Rail was just one part of an ideological push
823520	827280	towards an idea of free market individualism,
827280	830720	typical of the era of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.
831600	835200	Which is why she got on Jen's wonderful thumbnail for this video,
835200	840000	even though British Rail was actually privatized a few years later under John Major.
840800	843840	It was privatization as ideology.
844480	848160	Whether the changes actually made sense to implement or not
848240	849920	didn't really matter.
849920	853040	The individual is everything, and society...
854080	857200	Well, society doesn't even exist, actually.
857200	858720	Margaret Thatcher once said,
858720	861600	There is no such thing as society.
861600	865840	There are individual men and women, and there are families.
865840	869520	Now, the problem with this line of thinking, obviously,
869520	871120	is that it's a load of old shit.
872080	875040	But it's not hard to see why people who think like that
875040	880480	would be against public transportation and instead favor heavily the car.
880480	882880	Yeah, which is very individualistic indeed.
883440	887360	So that's my relatively obvious conclusion there.
887360	891440	Privatizing the rail network was an ideologically driven attempt
891440	895200	to enforce market conditions where they cannot exist.
895200	899520	I'm hesitant to lay the blame at any one individual's feet, however,
899520	902320	though there is a lot of blame to go around, you know.
902320	906880	The Conservatives deserve blame for actually, you know, doing it.
907840	910640	New Labour deserve blame for not undoing it.
911200	913760	The rolling stock and train operating companies
913760	915600	deserve their share of the blame as well.
916160	922800	But there exists a larger problem than any one greedy CEO or corrupt politician,
922800	924400	and it's a systemic problem.
925040	928160	I've mentioned the profit motive a few times today,
928160	931440	and that will probably factor into my next video in this vein.
932240	935680	The need for private companies to profit and grow,
935680	939120	and the need for the whole capitalist system to grow in turn,
939840	941760	that deserves a closer look.
941760	944400	Because as you run out of growth elsewhere,
944400	949520	the privatization of public services starts to look more and more viable.
949520	954160	So tune in next time where we'll be talking about capitalism's growth problem.
954720	956480	Thanks a lot for watching everyone,
956480	960000	and thanks for listening to me waffle about trains for a while.
960000	963760	Another possible route for continuing the line of thought in this video,
963760	966000	apart from talking about profit and growth,
966000	969040	is to talk about the current state of the NHS,
969040	971920	the UK's universal healthcare provider,
971920	976960	which the current government is not so sneakily attempting to privatize,
976960	978320	one slice at a time.
979200	980800	So let me know what you think there.
980800	985920	If you want more videos like this, shorter, more politics-oriented videos,
985920	986480	let me know.
987040	990080	Thanks as always to my supporters over on Patreon,
990080	992080	who are all very nice.
992800	995120	Look at all those amazing names there.
