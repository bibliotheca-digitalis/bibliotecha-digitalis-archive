00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello, everyone. Today's video is going to be about chess.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,380
Okay, so for the five of you who are still here, welcome. Let's get on with it. So, chess.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,560
Chess is a strategy game and one of the oldest games in existence.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,740
Historians have determined that the first game of chess was played sometime in the early...

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,780
Okay, I'm just kidding, of course. So why do I want to talk about chess today?

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,140
Well, I was watching Black Pigeon Speaks. Do you remember him?

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,360
He's the little fascist bird that hates women. You know the guy.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,440
By allowing women to fuck freely, the West has de facto entered a matriarchy.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Yeah, him.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,580
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this what they call poisoning the well?

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,980
Poisoning the well by directly quoting things he said? Well, no.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,200
I'm not doing that because it is, in fact, completely relevant to the topic of today's video,

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,860
which is about women chess players.

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,860
Now, I'm sorry that this is necessary, but we do have to watch a short clip from his video.

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,100
Although this is the only clip of his I'm going to show today, so just muddle through as best you can.

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,600
And moving down to Canada's Southern Neighbour, which has so many stories every week, it's hard to narrow them down,

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,580
but these are the ones that I found most interesting, and here they are.

18
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:27,160
As of publication of this video, the US Men's Chess Championship is currently underway with Grandmaster Wesley So,

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:34,260
who's 23, of Minnetonka, Minnesota, in a tie for first place with Daniel Narodiski.

20
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,660
But wait, something's not right here. Men's chess? Why are there no women competing in this tournament?

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,360
Which is a game solely reliant upon one's faculty, not body strength.

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,280
Why are chess tournaments separated by gender?

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,600
Women should play chess alongside men.

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,700
Chess isn't football or boxing. I've been told since childhood that women are every bit as smart as men,

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,860
and chess shouldn't be segregated like this.

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,320
But upon further investigation, it's not that women aren't allowed in the men's tournament,

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:10,220
but they don't have the skill to get into high-level competitions, and if it wasn't separate, no woman would ever win.

28
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,280
Like in sports, women aren't actually segregated by the rules.

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:23,520
It's just that women cannot compete against men and win in the mental game of chess, when it is the best of both genders facing off.

30
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,120
So that clip there was from the Black Pigeon Speaks video,

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,020
Merkling Mayhem, slash, Women Do Chess, and Sweden, Yes.

32
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,820
Sort of a random collection of letters there.

33
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,120
And that video is a bit like a poor man's version of a Sargon of Akkad,

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,420
this Week in Stupid type thing, where Black Pigeon Speaks features a bunch of seemingly random news stories,

35
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,420
and then says something horrible about them.

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:58,720
So what's the relevance of this particular news story about Grandmaster Wesley So having to play a tie-breaking match at the end of the US Chess Championship?

37
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Well, nothing really.

38
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:08,620
Black Pigeon Speaks is just using the story to go off on a tangent about the fact that the US Chess Championship has a women's division,

39
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,020
and he uses that as proof that women can't compete with men at chess, and are therefore less intelligent.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,820
And the logic goes that if women could compete with men, there would be no need to divide men and women into separate leagues.

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,820
So is Black Pigeon Speaks onto something here? Is it true that women can't compete with men at chess?

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:35,020
Well, I'd like to skip ahead at this point and share a news story from the 17th of this month from chess.com.

43
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,920
Hou Yi Fan, I think I'm saying that right, pressures Carlson, maintains lead at Grengke.

44
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,520
That's China's Hou Yi Fan, a woman pressuring Magnus Carlson, who, in addition to being a man,

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,020
is the world number one, the world chess champion, and the highest-rated player in history,

46
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,720
into a draw to maintain her lead at the Grengke chess classic.

47
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:07,820
Now, she was leading because she had previously defeated, in the first round of that tournament, Fabiano Caruana,

48
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,420
who is the third highest-rated player in history, behind only Magnus Carlson and Garry Kasparov.

49
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:21,520
And the interesting thing about Caruana here is that he was born in Miami, which means he's American, if you follow,

50
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:28,820
so he's eligible to play in the US Chess Championship, the very tournament that Black Pigeon Speaks was talking about,

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,520
which he did, coming in joint second behind Wesley So.

52
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,920
Now then, the incredibly sharp-eyed among you will have noticed something interesting here,

53
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:46,820
and this is just a minor point, but Black Pigeon Speaks said that Wesley So was tied for first place with Daniel Naroditsky.

54
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,420
Yes, he did. I can prove it.

55
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,820
Minnesota, in a tie for first place with Daniel Naroditsky.

56
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:01,520
See, but in this results table, we see that Daniel Naroditsky is, in fact, way down the table in joint fourth, so what happened there?

57
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,520
Well, the Star Tribune article that Black Pigeon Speaks took the headline from has a photograph of Wesley So,

58
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,520
which was taken during his game against Naroditsky.

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,720
So Black Pigeon Speaks saw that picture and incorrectly came to the conclusion that Naroditsky was So's playoff opponent,

60
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,820
when if you actually read the article, it's clear that it's a fellow called Alexander Anischuk.

61
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,520
So what does this error have to do with women chess players? Well, nothing, really.

62
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,520
I just thought it was a funny coincidence that while attempting to prove that women can't play chess properly,

63
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,820
Black Pigeon Speaks revealed that he can't read properly.

64
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,820
Anyway, back to Ho-Yi Fan at the Grenca Chess Classic.

65
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,320
Now then, according to Black Pigeon Speaks' logic, this situation should be impossible.

66
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,520
He says,

67
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,320
"...why are chess tournaments separated by gender? If it wasn't separate, no woman would ever win."

68
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,820
Yeah, but here we have a chess tournament that is not separated by gender, clearly, because it's got a woman in it,

69
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,220
and she's a woman who does have the skill to win.

70
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:10,220
Clearly, because she just beat the third highest-rated player in history and drew against the world chess champion.

71
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,520
So something funny is going on, isn't it?

72
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,320
Now, could it be that Black Pigeon Speaks doesn't actually know the first thing about chess

73
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,520
and is just bullshitting his audience into hating women?

74
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,020
Well, who knows? But let's give him the benefit of the doubt for now.

75
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,220
His video was published on the 11th of April of this year,

76
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,820
and the Grenca Chess Classic didn't start until the 15th, four days later.

77
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:41,120
So if Ho-Yi Fan is the first female chess player in history to ever play competitively against men at the top tournament level,

78
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
we can let Black Pigeon Speaks off here.

79
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,720
So... is she?

80
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,020
So who is this person?

81
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,720
Well, she's Hungarian chess grandmaster, Judit Polgar.

82
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,020
She was ranked in the top 100 players in the world by the time she was 12.

83
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:04,220
She achieved grandmaster status in 1991 at the age of 15, and was at the time the youngest grandmaster in history.

84
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:12,920
She's defeated 11 world champions, including Carlson, Karpov, Kramnik, Spassky, Topalov, Anand, and Garry Kasparov.

85
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,220
And at her peak rating, she was the world number eight.

86
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,820
Now, naturally, being one of the best players in the world, she won her fair share of tournaments.

87
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,720
Tournaments that had male players in them.

88
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,420
For example, she won the Hastings International Chess Congress in 1993,

89
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,220
she won the US Open Chess Championship in 1998,

90
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,420
one of her games at the Russia vs. Rest of the World tournament in 2002 is an interesting one.

91
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,420
And that tournament is as it sounds, you know, a bunch of Russians played a bunch of non-Russians.

92
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,220
So, Judit Polgar found herself matched against Garry Kasparov,

93
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:55,520
who's pictured here being accosted at a news conference by a remote-controlled dildo helicopter.

94
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,620
Now, he was at the time the world chess champion,

95
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,520
and also had a record of saying very disparaging things about female chess players.

96
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,120
And in fact, at once described Polgar by saying,

97
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,120
And then Judit Polgar beat him,

98
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,020
becoming the first woman to ever defeat the current world number one in competitive play.

99
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,520
And the Rest of the World team went on to narrowly beat the Russia team in that tournament.

100
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:35,120
A similar story here is that in 2015, British Grandmaster Nigel Short was taken to task

101
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,920
for saying that women were naturally hardwired to be worse at chess than men.

102
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,520
And critics of this sentiment were quick to point out that a couple of years previously,

103
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,320
Nigel Short had been beaten by Judit Polgar in Chess.com's Deathmatch tournament.

104
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,320
So I suppose his superior brain wiring must have been short-circuiting that day or something.

105
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,720
So then, to Black Pigeon Speaks, the question is not

106
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,720
can women compete at the highest levels of chess,

107
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,720
because players like Judit Polgar and Ho-Yi Fan have already settled that question.

108
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,020
They can.

109
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,120
No, the question is, why don't more women compete at that level?

110
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,720
Because that's the thing, only a relatively small amount of the world's current grandmasters are women.

111
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,720
So if women can do it, what's stopping more of them from doing it?

112
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,020
And that is an interesting question.

113
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,820
It's easy to say women can't pass a certain barrier in chess because of some biological factor.

114
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,020
But if you make a declaration about the limits of any one group of people based on biology,

115
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,620
time will eventually make a fool of you.

116
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,820
You know, there were people who said there will never be a female grandmaster,

117
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,720
and there were people who said a female chess player will never break the top 100,

118
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,920
and they'll never win a chess tournament against men,

119
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,820
they'll never break the top 10, they'll never defeat the world number one, etc.,

120
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,220
and eventually, of course, all of those things happened.

121
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,420
And today, there are people who say there'll never be a female world number one.

122
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,420
And there will.

123
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,620
Obviously, eventually, a woman will take the number one spot,

124
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,420
and then what will the goalpost movers say?

125
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,020
You know, there's only been one female number one so far.

126
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,420
The truth is that these biological arguments don't hold water.

127
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:26,020
Once any one woman proves it is biologically, physically possible for women to compete at that level,

128
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,620
that's the biology argument debunked.

129
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,820
So if we're asking why there aren't more female grandmasters,

130
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,420
we have to look beyond biology to possible social and psychological reasons.

131
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,620
And this is the exciting part where I get to talk about a fun study I read once,

132
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,420
Checkmate! The Role of Gender Stereotypes in the Ultimate Intellectual Sport.

133
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,820
Now, this study set out to test whether or not gender stereotypes affect chess ability.

134
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,020
And how did they do that?

135
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:03,420
Well, they took 42 female chess players and matched them with 42 male players of equivalent ability.

136
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,820
They then had them play a series of chess matches online.

137
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,620
However, the researchers did something very sneaky.

138
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,620
They misled the female group about the gender of their opponent,

139
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,820
such that some of the time they thought they were playing against men,

140
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
and some of the time they thought they were playing against women,

141
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,820
when actually they were only ever playing men.

142
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,420
Sometimes the exact same men.

143
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,020
And the results are very interesting.

144
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:35,020
When women falsely believed to be playing against another woman, they won about one game out of two.

145
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:41,420
However, these same women performed below chance when they knew they were playing against a male opponent.

146
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,820
Indeed, they performed more poorly against the same opponent when they knew they were playing against a male

147
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,620
than when they thought they were playing against a female.

148
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,620
In the experimental condition,

149
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,820
performance was reduced by about 50% when women were reminded of the stereotype

150
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,420
and when they were aware of the fact they were playing against a male opponent.

151
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,820
In this case, they won only one-fourth of the games.

152
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Yet these same women were able to win half of the games

153
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,820
when they were misled into believing that the opponent was a female.

154
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
The difference in performance is particularly impressive

155
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,420
if one considers that the opponent was exactly the same.

156
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,420
And the study then goes into the particular ways in which the women's games differed

157
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,620
depending on what gender they thought their opponent was.

158
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,620
You can see why I like this one, right?

159
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,220
It's very fun, isn't it?

160
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,820
Although I like all studies where the researchers mislead the subjects.

161
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,820
So anyway, maybe it's not that women aren't as smart as men.

162
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,820
I mean, number of chess grandmasters is only one metric, isn't it?

163
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,220
I mean, women now outnumber men among college graduates in many places in the West,

164
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,220
so by that metric, things look different.

165
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,220
But instead, maybe it's more to do with gender roles and gender expectations.

166
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,020
And I'd like to briefly introduce two new characters here.

167
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,220
You see, Grandmaster Judith Polgar has two sisters.

168
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,020
Fellow Grandmaster Susan Polgar and International Master Sophia Polgar.

169
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,820
Now you might think, well, isn't that odd?

170
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,220
Three chess masters, all women, from the same family.

171
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,820
What's going on there?

172
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:22,220
Well, they're the daughters of a chess teacher and educational psychologist called Laszlo Polgar

173
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,420
who tutored all three in chess from a very early age.

174
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,020
And like anyone, man or woman,

175
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,220
if you spend several hours a day practicing at something for a very long time,

176
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,820
then eventually, you get to be very good at it.

177
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,820
And if women are put in that environment where they practice chess every day,

178
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,620
then they clearly turn out no differently than men do, as chess masters.

179
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,820
And the fact that not as many get into chess to start with

180
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,620
or stick with it long enough to compete at the top level

181
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,620
seemingly has little to do with biology

182
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,820
and much more to do with gender expectations.

183
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,620
So then, to the initial question, why are there women's chess leagues?

184
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,620
Well, it's actually a fairly divisive issue among women chess players, I believe.

185
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,620
Some people argue that these leagues are important for getting more women into the game to begin with.

186
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:16,020
On the other hand, some female players, Judit Polgar included, I believe, argue that at the top level,

187
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,620
these leagues can actually hold women back

188
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,220
and they should instead aim to challenge the men in tournaments that aren't divided by gender.

189
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,220
BlackPitch and Speaks ignored all of this, of course,

190
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,620
just like he ignored the existence of players like Judit Polgar and Hou Yi Fan,

191
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,220
because why bother?

192
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,220
You know, if you're speaking to a completely ignorant audience

193
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,420
and your intent is to mislead them even further,

194
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,820
you know, why not lie?

195
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,020
It's not like they're gonna go and check, is it?

196
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,420
Anyway, I'll leave BlackPitch and Speaks here with a challenge.

197
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,420
If better at chess equals more intelligent than,

198
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,820
how about I play you at chess to determine who's right in this argument?

199
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,620
If you apparently know so much about chess, you know, it shouldn't be too hard just to beat me, should it?

200
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,220
So, let's play!

201
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,820
I'll play white in the first game just to get us started,

202
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,620
and I'm gonna open with 1D4.

203
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,420
And I'll await your response over on Twitter, the link's in the description there.

204
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,620
Come and have a go, if you think you're hard enough.

205
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,420
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

206
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,020
It's a relatively short one today, eh?

207
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,620
Oh well, a change is as good as a rest, so they say.

208
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,620
Thanks, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon.

209
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,420
There's quite a few more of them recently, which is rather exciting.

210
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,420
We're slowly building a little army over there.

211
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,820
And we're also rapidly closing in on our next Patreon goal,

212
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,420
where our plans for world domination will finally enter Phase 2.

213
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,220
So come along and join us.

214
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,820
It might be the only thing that saves you.

215
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,420
I'm kidding, of course.

216
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,220
Or am I?

217
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,020
You know, it's better to be safe than sorry, isn't it?
