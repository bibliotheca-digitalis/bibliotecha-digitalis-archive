0	4200	Hello, everyone. Today's video is going to be about chess.
5880	12380	Okay, so for the five of you who are still here, welcome. Let's get on with it. So, chess.
13020	17560	Chess is a strategy game and one of the oldest games in existence.
18420	23740	Historians have determined that the first game of chess was played sometime in the early...
24420	29780	Okay, I'm just kidding, of course. So why do I want to talk about chess today?
30060	34140	Well, I was watching Black Pigeon Speaks. Do you remember him?
34540	38360	He's the little fascist bird that hates women. You know the guy.
38720	43440	By allowing women to fuck freely, the West has de facto entered a matriarchy.
43840	44840	Yeah, him.
45040	48580	Oh, I'm sorry. Is this what they call poisoning the well?
48800	52980	Poisoning the well by directly quoting things he said? Well, no.
53240	58200	I'm not doing that because it is, in fact, completely relevant to the topic of today's video,
58200	60860	which is about women chess players.
61340	65860	Now, I'm sorry that this is necessary, but we do have to watch a short clip from his video.
66160	71100	Although this is the only clip of his I'm going to show today, so just muddle through as best you can.
71260	75600	And moving down to Canada's Southern Neighbour, which has so many stories every week, it's hard to narrow them down,
75600	79580	but these are the ones that I found most interesting, and here they are.
79740	87160	As of publication of this video, the US Men's Chess Championship is currently underway with Grandmaster Wesley So,
87160	94260	who's 23, of Minnetonka, Minnesota, in a tie for first place with Daniel Narodiski.
94460	99660	But wait, something's not right here. Men's chess? Why are there no women competing in this tournament?
100000	104360	Which is a game solely reliant upon one's faculty, not body strength.
104640	107280	Why are chess tournaments separated by gender?
107560	109600	Women should play chess alongside men.
109960	114700	Chess isn't football or boxing. I've been told since childhood that women are every bit as smart as men,
114700	116860	and chess shouldn't be segregated like this.
117060	122320	But upon further investigation, it's not that women aren't allowed in the men's tournament,
122680	130220	but they don't have the skill to get into high-level competitions, and if it wasn't separate, no woman would ever win.
130380	134280	Like in sports, women aren't actually segregated by the rules.
134580	143520	It's just that women cannot compete against men and win in the mental game of chess, when it is the best of both genders facing off.
143980	147120	So that clip there was from the Black Pigeon Speaks video,
147120	153020	Merkling Mayhem, slash, Women Do Chess, and Sweden, Yes.
153420	156820	Sort of a random collection of letters there.
156820	161120	And that video is a bit like a poor man's version of a Sargon of Akkad,
161120	167420	this Week in Stupid type thing, where Black Pigeon Speaks features a bunch of seemingly random news stories,
167420	169420	and then says something horrible about them.
169720	178720	So what's the relevance of this particular news story about Grandmaster Wesley So having to play a tie-breaking match at the end of the US Chess Championship?
178720	180720	Well, nothing really.
181020	188620	Black Pigeon Speaks is just using the story to go off on a tangent about the fact that the US Chess Championship has a women's division,
188620	195020	and he uses that as proof that women can't compete with men at chess, and are therefore less intelligent.
195320	201820	And the logic goes that if women could compete with men, there would be no need to divide men and women into separate leagues.
202120	208820	So is Black Pigeon Speaks onto something here? Is it true that women can't compete with men at chess?
209020	215020	Well, I'd like to skip ahead at this point and share a news story from the 17th of this month from chess.com.
215020	221920	Hou Yi Fan, I think I'm saying that right, pressures Carlson, maintains lead at Grengke.
221920	229520	That's China's Hou Yi Fan, a woman pressuring Magnus Carlson, who, in addition to being a man,
229520	235020	is the world number one, the world chess champion, and the highest-rated player in history,
235020	239720	into a draw to maintain her lead at the Grengke chess classic.
239720	247820	Now, she was leading because she had previously defeated, in the first round of that tournament, Fabiano Caruana,
248120	254420	who is the third highest-rated player in history, behind only Magnus Carlson and Garry Kasparov.
254820	261520	And the interesting thing about Caruana here is that he was born in Miami, which means he's American, if you follow,
261520	268820	so he's eligible to play in the US Chess Championship, the very tournament that Black Pigeon Speaks was talking about,
269120	273520	which he did, coming in joint second behind Wesley So.
274220	278920	Now then, the incredibly sharp-eyed among you will have noticed something interesting here,
278920	286820	and this is just a minor point, but Black Pigeon Speaks said that Wesley So was tied for first place with Daniel Naroditsky.
287620	289420	Yes, he did. I can prove it.
289420	293820	Minnesota, in a tie for first place with Daniel Naroditsky.
293820	301520	See, but in this results table, we see that Daniel Naroditsky is, in fact, way down the table in joint fourth, so what happened there?
301820	307520	Well, the Star Tribune article that Black Pigeon Speaks took the headline from has a photograph of Wesley So,
307520	310520	which was taken during his game against Naroditsky.
310920	317720	So Black Pigeon Speaks saw that picture and incorrectly came to the conclusion that Naroditsky was So's playoff opponent,
317720	322820	when if you actually read the article, it's clear that it's a fellow called Alexander Anischuk.
322820	327520	So what does this error have to do with women chess players? Well, nothing, really.
327520	333520	I just thought it was a funny coincidence that while attempting to prove that women can't play chess properly,
333520	336820	Black Pigeon Speaks revealed that he can't read properly.
337320	340820	Anyway, back to Ho-Yi Fan at the Grenca Chess Classic.
340820	346320	Now then, according to Black Pigeon Speaks' logic, this situation should be impossible.
346720	347520	He says,
347520	354320	"...why are chess tournaments separated by gender? If it wasn't separate, no woman would ever win."
354320	359820	Yeah, but here we have a chess tournament that is not separated by gender, clearly, because it's got a woman in it,
359820	363220	and she's a woman who does have the skill to win.
363220	370220	Clearly, because she just beat the third highest-rated player in history and drew against the world chess champion.
370220	372520	So something funny is going on, isn't it?
372820	377320	Now, could it be that Black Pigeon Speaks doesn't actually know the first thing about chess
377320	380520	and is just bullshitting his audience into hating women?
380920	385020	Well, who knows? But let's give him the benefit of the doubt for now.
385520	389220	His video was published on the 11th of April of this year,
389220	393820	and the Grenca Chess Classic didn't start until the 15th, four days later.
393820	401120	So if Ho-Yi Fan is the first female chess player in history to ever play competitively against men at the top tournament level,
401520	403520	we can let Black Pigeon Speaks off here.
404020	405720	So... is she?
406220	408020	So who is this person?
408020	412720	Well, she's Hungarian chess grandmaster, Judit Polgar.
412720	417020	She was ranked in the top 100 players in the world by the time she was 12.
417020	424220	She achieved grandmaster status in 1991 at the age of 15, and was at the time the youngest grandmaster in history.
424220	432920	She's defeated 11 world champions, including Carlson, Karpov, Kramnik, Spassky, Topalov, Anand, and Garry Kasparov.
432920	436220	And at her peak rating, she was the world number eight.
436220	441820	Now, naturally, being one of the best players in the world, she won her fair share of tournaments.
441820	444720	Tournaments that had male players in them.
444720	449420	For example, she won the Hastings International Chess Congress in 1993,
449420	453220	she won the US Open Chess Championship in 1998,
453220	459420	one of her games at the Russia vs. Rest of the World tournament in 2002 is an interesting one.
459420	464420	And that tournament is as it sounds, you know, a bunch of Russians played a bunch of non-Russians.
464420	469220	So, Judit Polgar found herself matched against Garry Kasparov,
469220	475520	who's pictured here being accosted at a news conference by a remote-controlled dildo helicopter.
475520	478620	Now, he was at the time the world chess champion,
478720	483520	and also had a record of saying very disparaging things about female chess players.
483520	486120	And in fact, at once described Polgar by saying,
495820	498120	And then Judit Polgar beat him,
498120	503020	becoming the first woman to ever defeat the current world number one in competitive play.
503020	508520	And the Rest of the World team went on to narrowly beat the Russia team in that tournament.
508820	515120	A similar story here is that in 2015, British Grandmaster Nigel Short was taken to task
515120	519920	for saying that women were naturally hardwired to be worse at chess than men.
519920	524520	And critics of this sentiment were quick to point out that a couple of years previously,
524520	530320	Nigel Short had been beaten by Judit Polgar in Chess.com's Deathmatch tournament.
530320	536320	So I suppose his superior brain wiring must have been short-circuiting that day or something.
536420	539720	So then, to Black Pigeon Speaks, the question is not
539720	542720	can women compete at the highest levels of chess,
542720	547720	because players like Judit Polgar and Ho-Yi Fan have already settled that question.
547720	549020	They can.
549020	553120	No, the question is, why don't more women compete at that level?
553120	558720	Because that's the thing, only a relatively small amount of the world's current grandmasters are women.
558720	563720	So if women can do it, what's stopping more of them from doing it?
563720	566020	And that is an interesting question.
566020	571820	It's easy to say women can't pass a certain barrier in chess because of some biological factor.
571820	577020	But if you make a declaration about the limits of any one group of people based on biology,
577020	579620	time will eventually make a fool of you.
579620	583820	You know, there were people who said there will never be a female grandmaster,
583820	587720	and there were people who said a female chess player will never break the top 100,
587720	590920	and they'll never win a chess tournament against men,
590920	595820	they'll never break the top 10, they'll never defeat the world number one, etc.,
595820	599220	and eventually, of course, all of those things happened.
599220	603420	And today, there are people who say there'll never be a female world number one.
603420	604420	And there will.
604420	607620	Obviously, eventually, a woman will take the number one spot,
607620	610420	and then what will the goalpost movers say?
610420	615020	You know, there's only been one female number one so far.
615020	619420	The truth is that these biological arguments don't hold water.
619420	626020	Once any one woman proves it is biologically, physically possible for women to compete at that level,
626020	628620	that's the biology argument debunked.
628620	631820	So if we're asking why there aren't more female grandmasters,
631820	637420	we have to look beyond biology to possible social and psychological reasons.
637420	642620	And this is the exciting part where I get to talk about a fun study I read once,
642620	648420	Checkmate! The Role of Gender Stereotypes in the Ultimate Intellectual Sport.
648420	653820	Now, this study set out to test whether or not gender stereotypes affect chess ability.
653820	656020	And how did they do that?
656020	663420	Well, they took 42 female chess players and matched them with 42 male players of equivalent ability.
663420	666820	They then had them play a series of chess matches online.
666820	670620	However, the researchers did something very sneaky.
670620	674620	They misled the female group about the gender of their opponent,
674620	677820	such that some of the time they thought they were playing against men,
677820	680820	and some of the time they thought they were playing against women,
680820	683820	when actually they were only ever playing men.
683820	686420	Sometimes the exact same men.
686420	689020	And the results are very interesting.
689020	695020	When women falsely believed to be playing against another woman, they won about one game out of two.
695020	701420	However, these same women performed below chance when they knew they were playing against a male opponent.
701420	706820	Indeed, they performed more poorly against the same opponent when they knew they were playing against a male
706820	709620	than when they thought they were playing against a female.
709620	711620	In the experimental condition,
711620	716820	performance was reduced by about 50% when women were reminded of the stereotype
716820	720420	and when they were aware of the fact they were playing against a male opponent.
720420	723820	In this case, they won only one-fourth of the games.
723820	726820	Yet these same women were able to win half of the games
726820	730820	when they were misled into believing that the opponent was a female.
730820	733820	The difference in performance is particularly impressive
733820	737420	if one considers that the opponent was exactly the same.
737420	741420	And the study then goes into the particular ways in which the women's games differed
741420	744620	depending on what gender they thought their opponent was.
744620	746620	You can see why I like this one, right?
746620	748220	It's very fun, isn't it?
748220	752820	Although I like all studies where the researchers mislead the subjects.
752820	756820	So anyway, maybe it's not that women aren't as smart as men.
756820	760820	I mean, number of chess grandmasters is only one metric, isn't it?
760820	765220	I mean, women now outnumber men among college graduates in many places in the West,
765220	768220	so by that metric, things look different.
768220	773220	But instead, maybe it's more to do with gender roles and gender expectations.
773220	777020	And I'd like to briefly introduce two new characters here.
777020	781220	You see, Grandmaster Judith Polgar has two sisters.
781220	787020	Fellow Grandmaster Susan Polgar and International Master Sophia Polgar.
787020	789820	Now you might think, well, isn't that odd?
789820	794220	Three chess masters, all women, from the same family.
794220	795820	What's going on there?
795820	802220	Well, they're the daughters of a chess teacher and educational psychologist called Laszlo Polgar
802220	805420	who tutored all three in chess from a very early age.
805420	808020	And like anyone, man or woman,
808020	812220	if you spend several hours a day practicing at something for a very long time,
812220	814820	then eventually, you get to be very good at it.
814820	818820	And if women are put in that environment where they practice chess every day,
818820	823620	then they clearly turn out no differently than men do, as chess masters.
823620	826820	And the fact that not as many get into chess to start with
826820	829620	or stick with it long enough to compete at the top level
829620	832620	seemingly has little to do with biology
832620	835820	and much more to do with gender expectations.
835820	840620	So then, to the initial question, why are there women's chess leagues?
840620	844620	Well, it's actually a fairly divisive issue among women chess players, I believe.
844620	849620	Some people argue that these leagues are important for getting more women into the game to begin with.
849620	856020	On the other hand, some female players, Judit Polgar included, I believe, argue that at the top level,
856020	858620	these leagues can actually hold women back
858620	863220	and they should instead aim to challenge the men in tournaments that aren't divided by gender.
863220	866220	BlackPitch and Speaks ignored all of this, of course,
866220	870620	just like he ignored the existence of players like Judit Polgar and Hou Yi Fan,
870620	872220	because why bother?
872220	875220	You know, if you're speaking to a completely ignorant audience
875220	878420	and your intent is to mislead them even further,
878420	879820	you know, why not lie?
879820	882020	It's not like they're gonna go and check, is it?
882020	885420	Anyway, I'll leave BlackPitch and Speaks here with a challenge.
885420	889420	If better at chess equals more intelligent than,
889420	894820	how about I play you at chess to determine who's right in this argument?
894820	899620	If you apparently know so much about chess, you know, it shouldn't be too hard just to beat me, should it?
899620	901220	So, let's play!
901220	904820	I'll play white in the first game just to get us started,
904820	907620	and I'm gonna open with 1D4.
907620	912420	And I'll await your response over on Twitter, the link's in the description there.
912420	915620	Come and have a go, if you think you're hard enough.
915620	917420	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
917420	920020	It's a relatively short one today, eh?
920020	923620	Oh well, a change is as good as a rest, so they say.
923620	927620	Thanks, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon.
927620	931420	There's quite a few more of them recently, which is rather exciting.
931420	934420	We're slowly building a little army over there.
934420	937820	And we're also rapidly closing in on our next Patreon goal,
937820	942420	where our plans for world domination will finally enter Phase 2.
942420	944220	So come along and join us.
944220	946820	It might be the only thing that saves you.
946820	948420	I'm kidding, of course.
948420	949220	Or am I?
949220	952020	You know, it's better to be safe than sorry, isn't it?
