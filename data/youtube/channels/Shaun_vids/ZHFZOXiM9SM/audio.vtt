00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
Hello, everyone. Today's video is going to be about chess.

00:05.880 --> 00:12.380
Okay, so for the five of you who are still here, welcome. Let's get on with it. So, chess.

00:13.020 --> 00:17.560
Chess is a strategy game and one of the oldest games in existence.

00:18.420 --> 00:23.740
Historians have determined that the first game of chess was played sometime in the early...

00:24.420 --> 00:29.780
Okay, I'm just kidding, of course. So why do I want to talk about chess today?

00:30.060 --> 00:34.140
Well, I was watching Black Pigeon Speaks. Do you remember him?

00:34.540 --> 00:38.360
He's the little fascist bird that hates women. You know the guy.

00:38.720 --> 00:43.440
By allowing women to fuck freely, the West has de facto entered a matriarchy.

00:43.840 --> 00:44.840
Yeah, him.

00:45.040 --> 00:48.580
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this what they call poisoning the well?

00:48.800 --> 00:52.980
Poisoning the well by directly quoting things he said? Well, no.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.200
I'm not doing that because it is, in fact, completely relevant to the topic of today's video,

00:58.200 --> 01:00.860
which is about women chess players.

01:01.340 --> 01:05.860
Now, I'm sorry that this is necessary, but we do have to watch a short clip from his video.

01:06.160 --> 01:11.100
Although this is the only clip of his I'm going to show today, so just muddle through as best you can.

01:11.260 --> 01:15.600
And moving down to Canada's Southern Neighbour, which has so many stories every week, it's hard to narrow them down,

01:15.600 --> 01:19.580
but these are the ones that I found most interesting, and here they are.

01:19.740 --> 01:27.160
As of publication of this video, the US Men's Chess Championship is currently underway with Grandmaster Wesley So,

01:27.160 --> 01:34.260
who's 23, of Minnetonka, Minnesota, in a tie for first place with Daniel Narodiski.

01:34.460 --> 01:39.660
But wait, something's not right here. Men's chess? Why are there no women competing in this tournament?

01:40.000 --> 01:44.360
Which is a game solely reliant upon one's faculty, not body strength.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.280
Why are chess tournaments separated by gender?

01:47.560 --> 01:49.600
Women should play chess alongside men.

01:49.960 --> 01:54.700
Chess isn't football or boxing. I've been told since childhood that women are every bit as smart as men,

01:54.700 --> 01:56.860
and chess shouldn't be segregated like this.

01:57.060 --> 02:02.320
But upon further investigation, it's not that women aren't allowed in the men's tournament,

02:02.680 --> 02:10.220
but they don't have the skill to get into high-level competitions, and if it wasn't separate, no woman would ever win.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.280
Like in sports, women aren't actually segregated by the rules.

02:14.580 --> 02:23.520
It's just that women cannot compete against men and win in the mental game of chess, when it is the best of both genders facing off.

02:23.980 --> 02:27.120
So that clip there was from the Black Pigeon Speaks video,

02:27.120 --> 02:33.020
Merkling Mayhem, slash, Women Do Chess, and Sweden, Yes.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.820
Sort of a random collection of letters there.

02:36.820 --> 02:41.120
And that video is a bit like a poor man's version of a Sargon of Akkad,

02:41.120 --> 02:47.420
this Week in Stupid type thing, where Black Pigeon Speaks features a bunch of seemingly random news stories,

02:47.420 --> 02:49.420
and then says something horrible about them.

02:49.720 --> 02:58.720
So what's the relevance of this particular news story about Grandmaster Wesley So having to play a tie-breaking match at the end of the US Chess Championship?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.720
Well, nothing really.

03:01.020 --> 03:08.620
Black Pigeon Speaks is just using the story to go off on a tangent about the fact that the US Chess Championship has a women's division,

03:08.620 --> 03:15.020
and he uses that as proof that women can't compete with men at chess, and are therefore less intelligent.

03:15.320 --> 03:21.820
And the logic goes that if women could compete with men, there would be no need to divide men and women into separate leagues.

03:22.120 --> 03:28.820
So is Black Pigeon Speaks onto something here? Is it true that women can't compete with men at chess?

03:29.020 --> 03:35.020
Well, I'd like to skip ahead at this point and share a news story from the 17th of this month from chess.com.

03:35.020 --> 03:41.920
Hou Yi Fan, I think I'm saying that right, pressures Carlson, maintains lead at Grengke.

03:41.920 --> 03:49.520
That's China's Hou Yi Fan, a woman pressuring Magnus Carlson, who, in addition to being a man,

03:49.520 --> 03:55.020
is the world number one, the world chess champion, and the highest-rated player in history,

03:55.020 --> 03:59.720
into a draw to maintain her lead at the Grengke chess classic.

03:59.720 --> 04:07.820
Now, she was leading because she had previously defeated, in the first round of that tournament, Fabiano Caruana,

04:08.120 --> 04:14.420
who is the third highest-rated player in history, behind only Magnus Carlson and Garry Kasparov.

04:14.820 --> 04:21.520
And the interesting thing about Caruana here is that he was born in Miami, which means he's American, if you follow,

04:21.520 --> 04:28.820
so he's eligible to play in the US Chess Championship, the very tournament that Black Pigeon Speaks was talking about,

04:29.120 --> 04:33.520
which he did, coming in joint second behind Wesley So.

04:34.220 --> 04:38.920
Now then, the incredibly sharp-eyed among you will have noticed something interesting here,

04:38.920 --> 04:46.820
and this is just a minor point, but Black Pigeon Speaks said that Wesley So was tied for first place with Daniel Naroditsky.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.420
Yes, he did. I can prove it.

04:49.420 --> 04:53.820
Minnesota, in a tie for first place with Daniel Naroditsky.

04:53.820 --> 05:01.520
See, but in this results table, we see that Daniel Naroditsky is, in fact, way down the table in joint fourth, so what happened there?

05:01.820 --> 05:07.520
Well, the Star Tribune article that Black Pigeon Speaks took the headline from has a photograph of Wesley So,

05:07.520 --> 05:10.520
which was taken during his game against Naroditsky.

05:10.920 --> 05:17.720
So Black Pigeon Speaks saw that picture and incorrectly came to the conclusion that Naroditsky was So's playoff opponent,

05:17.720 --> 05:22.820
when if you actually read the article, it's clear that it's a fellow called Alexander Anischuk.

05:22.820 --> 05:27.520
So what does this error have to do with women chess players? Well, nothing, really.

05:27.520 --> 05:33.520
I just thought it was a funny coincidence that while attempting to prove that women can't play chess properly,

05:33.520 --> 05:36.820
Black Pigeon Speaks revealed that he can't read properly.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.820
Anyway, back to Ho-Yi Fan at the Grenca Chess Classic.

05:40.820 --> 05:46.320
Now then, according to Black Pigeon Speaks' logic, this situation should be impossible.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.520
He says,

05:47.520 --> 05:54.320
"...why are chess tournaments separated by gender? If it wasn't separate, no woman would ever win."

05:54.320 --> 05:59.820
Yeah, but here we have a chess tournament that is not separated by gender, clearly, because it's got a woman in it,

05:59.820 --> 06:03.220
and she's a woman who does have the skill to win.

06:03.220 --> 06:10.220
Clearly, because she just beat the third highest-rated player in history and drew against the world chess champion.

06:10.220 --> 06:12.520
So something funny is going on, isn't it?

06:12.820 --> 06:17.320
Now, could it be that Black Pigeon Speaks doesn't actually know the first thing about chess

06:17.320 --> 06:20.520
and is just bullshitting his audience into hating women?

06:20.920 --> 06:25.020
Well, who knows? But let's give him the benefit of the doubt for now.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.220
His video was published on the 11th of April of this year,

06:29.220 --> 06:33.820
and the Grenca Chess Classic didn't start until the 15th, four days later.

06:33.820 --> 06:41.120
So if Ho-Yi Fan is the first female chess player in history to ever play competitively against men at the top tournament level,

06:41.520 --> 06:43.520
we can let Black Pigeon Speaks off here.

06:44.020 --> 06:45.720
So... is she?

06:46.220 --> 06:48.020
So who is this person?

06:48.020 --> 06:52.720
Well, she's Hungarian chess grandmaster, Judit Polgar.

06:52.720 --> 06:57.020
She was ranked in the top 100 players in the world by the time she was 12.

06:57.020 --> 07:04.220
She achieved grandmaster status in 1991 at the age of 15, and was at the time the youngest grandmaster in history.

07:04.220 --> 07:12.920
She's defeated 11 world champions, including Carlson, Karpov, Kramnik, Spassky, Topalov, Anand, and Garry Kasparov.

07:12.920 --> 07:16.220
And at her peak rating, she was the world number eight.

07:16.220 --> 07:21.820
Now, naturally, being one of the best players in the world, she won her fair share of tournaments.

07:21.820 --> 07:24.720
Tournaments that had male players in them.

07:24.720 --> 07:29.420
For example, she won the Hastings International Chess Congress in 1993,

07:29.420 --> 07:33.220
she won the US Open Chess Championship in 1998,

07:33.220 --> 07:39.420
one of her games at the Russia vs. Rest of the World tournament in 2002 is an interesting one.

07:39.420 --> 07:44.420
And that tournament is as it sounds, you know, a bunch of Russians played a bunch of non-Russians.

07:44.420 --> 07:49.220
So, Judit Polgar found herself matched against Garry Kasparov,

07:49.220 --> 07:55.520
who's pictured here being accosted at a news conference by a remote-controlled dildo helicopter.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.620
Now, he was at the time the world chess champion,

07:58.720 --> 08:03.520
and also had a record of saying very disparaging things about female chess players.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.120
And in fact, at once described Polgar by saying,

08:15.820 --> 08:18.120
And then Judit Polgar beat him,

08:18.120 --> 08:23.020
becoming the first woman to ever defeat the current world number one in competitive play.

08:23.020 --> 08:28.520
And the Rest of the World team went on to narrowly beat the Russia team in that tournament.

08:28.820 --> 08:35.120
A similar story here is that in 2015, British Grandmaster Nigel Short was taken to task

08:35.120 --> 08:39.920
for saying that women were naturally hardwired to be worse at chess than men.

08:39.920 --> 08:44.520
And critics of this sentiment were quick to point out that a couple of years previously,

08:44.520 --> 08:50.320
Nigel Short had been beaten by Judit Polgar in Chess.com's Deathmatch tournament.

08:50.320 --> 08:56.320
So I suppose his superior brain wiring must have been short-circuiting that day or something.

08:56.420 --> 08:59.720
So then, to Black Pigeon Speaks, the question is not

08:59.720 --> 09:02.720
can women compete at the highest levels of chess,

09:02.720 --> 09:07.720
because players like Judit Polgar and Ho-Yi Fan have already settled that question.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.020
They can.

09:09.020 --> 09:13.120
No, the question is, why don't more women compete at that level?

09:13.120 --> 09:18.720
Because that's the thing, only a relatively small amount of the world's current grandmasters are women.

09:18.720 --> 09:23.720
So if women can do it, what's stopping more of them from doing it?

09:23.720 --> 09:26.020
And that is an interesting question.

09:26.020 --> 09:31.820
It's easy to say women can't pass a certain barrier in chess because of some biological factor.

09:31.820 --> 09:37.020
But if you make a declaration about the limits of any one group of people based on biology,

09:37.020 --> 09:39.620
time will eventually make a fool of you.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.820
You know, there were people who said there will never be a female grandmaster,

09:43.820 --> 09:47.720
and there were people who said a female chess player will never break the top 100,

09:47.720 --> 09:50.920
and they'll never win a chess tournament against men,

09:50.920 --> 09:55.820
they'll never break the top 10, they'll never defeat the world number one, etc.,

09:55.820 --> 09:59.220
and eventually, of course, all of those things happened.

09:59.220 --> 10:03.420
And today, there are people who say there'll never be a female world number one.

10:03.420 --> 10:04.420
And there will.

10:04.420 --> 10:07.620
Obviously, eventually, a woman will take the number one spot,

10:07.620 --> 10:10.420
and then what will the goalpost movers say?

10:10.420 --> 10:15.020
You know, there's only been one female number one so far.

10:15.020 --> 10:19.420
The truth is that these biological arguments don't hold water.

10:19.420 --> 10:26.020
Once any one woman proves it is biologically, physically possible for women to compete at that level,

10:26.020 --> 10:28.620
that's the biology argument debunked.

10:28.620 --> 10:31.820
So if we're asking why there aren't more female grandmasters,

10:31.820 --> 10:37.420
we have to look beyond biology to possible social and psychological reasons.

10:37.420 --> 10:42.620
And this is the exciting part where I get to talk about a fun study I read once,

10:42.620 --> 10:48.420
Checkmate! The Role of Gender Stereotypes in the Ultimate Intellectual Sport.

10:48.420 --> 10:53.820
Now, this study set out to test whether or not gender stereotypes affect chess ability.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.020
And how did they do that?

10:56.020 --> 11:03.420
Well, they took 42 female chess players and matched them with 42 male players of equivalent ability.

11:03.420 --> 11:06.820
They then had them play a series of chess matches online.

11:06.820 --> 11:10.620
However, the researchers did something very sneaky.

11:10.620 --> 11:14.620
They misled the female group about the gender of their opponent,

11:14.620 --> 11:17.820
such that some of the time they thought they were playing against men,

11:17.820 --> 11:20.820
and some of the time they thought they were playing against women,

11:20.820 --> 11:23.820
when actually they were only ever playing men.

11:23.820 --> 11:26.420
Sometimes the exact same men.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.020
And the results are very interesting.

11:29.020 --> 11:35.020
When women falsely believed to be playing against another woman, they won about one game out of two.

11:35.020 --> 11:41.420
However, these same women performed below chance when they knew they were playing against a male opponent.

11:41.420 --> 11:46.820
Indeed, they performed more poorly against the same opponent when they knew they were playing against a male

11:46.820 --> 11:49.620
than when they thought they were playing against a female.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.620
In the experimental condition,

11:51.620 --> 11:56.820
performance was reduced by about 50% when women were reminded of the stereotype

11:56.820 --> 12:00.420
and when they were aware of the fact they were playing against a male opponent.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.820
In this case, they won only one-fourth of the games.

12:03.820 --> 12:06.820
Yet these same women were able to win half of the games

12:06.820 --> 12:10.820
when they were misled into believing that the opponent was a female.

12:10.820 --> 12:13.820
The difference in performance is particularly impressive

12:13.820 --> 12:17.420
if one considers that the opponent was exactly the same.

12:17.420 --> 12:21.420
And the study then goes into the particular ways in which the women's games differed

12:21.420 --> 12:24.620
depending on what gender they thought their opponent was.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.620
You can see why I like this one, right?

12:26.620 --> 12:28.220
It's very fun, isn't it?

12:28.220 --> 12:32.820
Although I like all studies where the researchers mislead the subjects.

12:32.820 --> 12:36.820
So anyway, maybe it's not that women aren't as smart as men.

12:36.820 --> 12:40.820
I mean, number of chess grandmasters is only one metric, isn't it?

12:40.820 --> 12:45.220
I mean, women now outnumber men among college graduates in many places in the West,

12:45.220 --> 12:48.220
so by that metric, things look different.

12:48.220 --> 12:53.220
But instead, maybe it's more to do with gender roles and gender expectations.

12:53.220 --> 12:57.020
And I'd like to briefly introduce two new characters here.

12:57.020 --> 13:01.220
You see, Grandmaster Judith Polgar has two sisters.

13:01.220 --> 13:07.020
Fellow Grandmaster Susan Polgar and International Master Sophia Polgar.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.820
Now you might think, well, isn't that odd?

13:09.820 --> 13:14.220
Three chess masters, all women, from the same family.

13:14.220 --> 13:15.820
What's going on there?

13:15.820 --> 13:22.220
Well, they're the daughters of a chess teacher and educational psychologist called Laszlo Polgar

13:22.220 --> 13:25.420
who tutored all three in chess from a very early age.

13:25.420 --> 13:28.020
And like anyone, man or woman,

13:28.020 --> 13:32.220
if you spend several hours a day practicing at something for a very long time,

13:32.220 --> 13:34.820
then eventually, you get to be very good at it.

13:34.820 --> 13:38.820
And if women are put in that environment where they practice chess every day,

13:38.820 --> 13:43.620
then they clearly turn out no differently than men do, as chess masters.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.820
And the fact that not as many get into chess to start with

13:46.820 --> 13:49.620
or stick with it long enough to compete at the top level

13:49.620 --> 13:52.620
seemingly has little to do with biology

13:52.620 --> 13:55.820
and much more to do with gender expectations.

13:55.820 --> 14:00.620
So then, to the initial question, why are there women's chess leagues?

14:00.620 --> 14:04.620
Well, it's actually a fairly divisive issue among women chess players, I believe.

14:04.620 --> 14:09.620
Some people argue that these leagues are important for getting more women into the game to begin with.

14:09.620 --> 14:16.020
On the other hand, some female players, Judit Polgar included, I believe, argue that at the top level,

14:16.020 --> 14:18.620
these leagues can actually hold women back

14:18.620 --> 14:23.220
and they should instead aim to challenge the men in tournaments that aren't divided by gender.

14:23.220 --> 14:26.220
BlackPitch and Speaks ignored all of this, of course,

14:26.220 --> 14:30.620
just like he ignored the existence of players like Judit Polgar and Hou Yi Fan,

14:30.620 --> 14:32.220
because why bother?

14:32.220 --> 14:35.220
You know, if you're speaking to a completely ignorant audience

14:35.220 --> 14:38.420
and your intent is to mislead them even further,

14:38.420 --> 14:39.820
you know, why not lie?

14:39.820 --> 14:42.020
It's not like they're gonna go and check, is it?

14:42.020 --> 14:45.420
Anyway, I'll leave BlackPitch and Speaks here with a challenge.

14:45.420 --> 14:49.420
If better at chess equals more intelligent than,

14:49.420 --> 14:54.820
how about I play you at chess to determine who's right in this argument?

14:54.820 --> 14:59.620
If you apparently know so much about chess, you know, it shouldn't be too hard just to beat me, should it?

14:59.620 --> 15:01.220
So, let's play!

15:01.220 --> 15:04.820
I'll play white in the first game just to get us started,

15:04.820 --> 15:07.620
and I'm gonna open with 1D4.

15:07.620 --> 15:12.420
And I'll await your response over on Twitter, the link's in the description there.

15:12.420 --> 15:15.620
Come and have a go, if you think you're hard enough.

15:15.620 --> 15:17.420
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

15:17.420 --> 15:20.020
It's a relatively short one today, eh?

15:20.020 --> 15:23.620
Oh well, a change is as good as a rest, so they say.

15:23.620 --> 15:27.620
Thanks, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon.

15:27.620 --> 15:31.420
There's quite a few more of them recently, which is rather exciting.

15:31.420 --> 15:34.420
We're slowly building a little army over there.

15:34.420 --> 15:37.820
And we're also rapidly closing in on our next Patreon goal,

15:37.820 --> 15:42.420
where our plans for world domination will finally enter Phase 2.

15:42.420 --> 15:44.220
So come along and join us.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.820
It might be the only thing that saves you.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.420
I'm kidding, of course.

15:48.420 --> 15:49.220
Or am I?

15:49.220 --> 15:52.020
You know, it's better to be safe than sorry, isn't it?
