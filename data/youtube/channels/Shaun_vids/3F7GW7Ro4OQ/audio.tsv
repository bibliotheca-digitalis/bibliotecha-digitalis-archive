0	1200	Hello, everyone.
1200	8640	This video is part four in a series of videos about a deeply transphobic article that was posted by the BBC on their website.
9080	15040	I'd recommend that you go and watch those three first if you need to get up to speed, since I'm gonna jump right in at
15040	15800	the deep end here.
15800	21920	But do not worry if you watch those videos and get the impression that you may have missed out on the opportunity to complain,
22240	26100	because, as always, there is something new to complain about today.
26180	31540	So, the BBC have finally responded to the complaints sent to their Executive Complaints Unit,
31540	35760	and they did so in a general statement posted to their complaints page titled
44340	49860	This is a long statement that seeks to address various different complaints that were raised against the article,
49860	52620	and if we're being nice, we can call it a mixed bag.
52780	57900	So, let's start with what I suppose we can call the good news and talk about the two major
58260	60260	concessions that have been made by the BBC.
60940	62940	Firstly, the response says
82620	87020	...beyond pressure applied by trans women, whereas its focus was at least as much on
87020	95500	internalized pressure experienced by some lesbians as a result of a climate of opinion as they perceived it within the LGBT community,
95500	98940	rather than pressure directly applied by trans women.
98940	104380	In the head of the ECU's view, the headline gave a somewhat misleading impression of the article itself,
104380	110940	and it appeared from many of the complaints that this had contributed to an understanding of the article as more focused on the conduct of
110940	116620	trans women than was in fact the case. To that extent, it fell below the BBC's standards of
116620	121340	geo-accuracy. And as a result of this, the title of the article has been changed to
121340	126140	...the lesbians who feel pressured to have sex and relationships with trans women.
126140	130380	And this is a point I discussed way back in my first video about this article.
130380	135900	The original title gave the impression that pressure was being applied by trans women specifically,
135900	141420	but then the article and attached survey fail to evidence this, spending much more time talking
141420	148460	about an indirect social pressure felt by certain cis lesbians. So the BBC have changed the headline
148460	153020	of the article to make it more accurate to what they now claim the article is about.
153020	157660	I say what they now claim the article is about because I'm not willing to go along with their
157660	163340	logic that the original headline was not suited to the article's intent. Whatever they claim the
163340	169340	article is about now, its intent is to attack trans women and launder anti-trans propaganda
169340	173900	from hate groups that want to take away the rights of trans people. It is not the case,
173900	178940	as the BBC would now have you believe, that the article is in fact about something else.
178940	184140	It is intended to paint trans women as villains, they just failed to properly evidence the claim,
184140	189100	and so now they've been forced to change the headline. Also, if we go along with the BBC's
189100	194380	claim here that the topic under discussion is actually a pressure felt by cis lesbians rather
194380	199740	than a pressure applied by trans women, then a whole new problem arises with the article.
199740	204460	But let's put a pin in that for a second and first talk about the other concession from the BBC,
204460	208060	which concerns the Get the L Out questionnaire. And I quote,
208060	213660	The Get the L Out questionnaire's findings, as reported in the article, for example that 56%
213660	218460	of those who responded reported being pressured or coerced to accept a trans woman as a sexual
218460	222540	partner, tended to give the impression that pressure to have sex with trans women,
222540	226140	whether from individual trans women or from an activist consensus,
226140	229980	was a widespread or even a majority experience among lesbians.
229980	235260	In the head of the ECU's judgement, however, it provided an insufficient basis for that impression.
235260	240060	The questionnaire was sent to a small number of women-only and lesbian-only groups,
240060	243740	and only around a third of its 80 respondents were from the UK.
243740	248540	The article included some caveats. However, these did not seem to us to go far enough to
248540	253340	make clear to readers the survey's lack of statistical validity, or the extent to which
253340	257580	Get the L Out has an agenda, which the results of the survey appear to serve.
257580	262460	To the extent that the article failed to exercise the appropriate degree of skepticism in its
262460	266780	treatment of the survey, it fell below the BBC's standards of geo-accuracy.
266780	271020	And as a result of this finding, the article has been amended to include a description of the
271100	275660	survey as being not statistically valid. Now, this is a relative good,
275660	279100	but it still falls short of the only acceptable response here,
279100	282700	which is to delete the entire article and apologize.
282700	285820	I mean, it's getting a bit embarrassing, right?
285820	289980	If we consider the whole article's history, they've had to drop their biggest contributor
289980	293660	for being a transphobe with a history of sexually assaulting women.
293660	298300	They've been forced to change the title for falling below their standards of geo-accuracy.
298300	303100	They've had to admit their main source of data is biased and statistically invalid.
303100	305900	So why does this article still exist?
305900	310620	The ECU response even concludes that, despite all this, the piece is still, quote,
310620	313420	a legitimate piece of journalism overall.
313420	318300	And I'd like to remind everyone of the BBC's earlier response to the initial complaints
318300	322700	sent about the article, where they claimed the article was carefully considered before
322700	326940	publication and went through an internal editorial review process.
326940	329260	And did it? Because,
329260	334140	and I'm forced to point out the obvious here, but they didn't do a very good job, did they?
334140	338460	Not only did they not catch the instances in which the ECU response declares the
338460	342140	article to have fallen below the BBC's accuracy standards,
342140	347260	Lily Cade's sexual assault allegations were public knowledge before this article was published,
347260	349020	and they didn't catch that either.
349020	353740	I think the BBC's internal review process needs an external review,
353740	357180	because this article never should have made it to publication.
357180	363180	And I really dislike the slimy way they refuse to admit anything they'd have to issue an apology for.
363180	366620	For instance, on the issue of Lily Cade's sexual assault allegations,
366620	372060	they merely say they escaped attention, and then later they came to light.
372060	378060	Yes, they came to light when people did your job for you and told you about publicly available
378060	381660	information that you could have discovered with a basic Google search.
382300	386940	Internal editorial review process. My foot.
386940	388780	So, that was the good news.
388780	392940	Now let's talk about the points where I disagree with the ECU response.
392940	394060	And there's a few of these.
394620	398780	And in no particular order, let's start with their defense of the decision to not mention
398780	401660	the reasons why Lily Cade was cut from the article.
401660	402780	And I quote,
402780	407420	A number of complainants considered the update did not give sufficient detail of the reason
407420	412780	why Miss Cade's contribution had been removed, but the BBC has to consider how to describe offensive
412780	418140	material without repeating and perpetuating any offense it may cause, and the head of the ECU
418140	422300	believed the absence of detail was justified in this instance.
422300	425740	Now this response reveals a blatant double standard.
425740	428780	If we consider this claim in isolation, we can say,
428780	434460	sure, maybe, to avoid causing offense, the BBC didn't want to bring up Lily Cade's violent
434460	440060	threats and sexual assaults unnecessarily, so they simply used euphemisms and called them
440060	442700	comments and inappropriate behavior.
442700	443660	Fair enough.
443660	447020	However, we're not considering this claim in isolation.
447020	451980	This amendment is attached to an article which contains several descriptions of both violent
451980	454140	threats and sexual assaults.
454140	458220	The first sentence of the article is describing a death threat, in fact,
458220	460860	and none of these are described euphemistically.
460860	466140	So why does the BBC's responsibility to describe offensive material without repeating and
466140	469580	perpetuating any offense it may cause not apply here?
469580	473900	Why isn't there an absence of detail when it comes to the violence and sexual assault
473900	475980	described in the text of the article?
475980	480700	The answer to these rhetorical questions is that whatever the BBC says, the point of this
480700	486780	article is to attack trans women and paint them as presenting some unique danger to cis lesbians,
486780	491340	and describing Lily Cade's behaviors would undermine that point.
491340	495180	So it's okay to talk about death threats and rape when you're attributing those things
495180	501180	to anonymous trans women, but when it's a cis lesbian doing those things, those exact
501180	502460	same things.
502460	507340	Suddenly, after thousands of words of talking about these topics openly, we're now all
507340	511980	of a sudden concerned about offense, so we can't repeat what Lily Cade did to get removed
511980	513260	from the article.
513260	515100	What a load of shit.
515100	520060	The ECU response really starts tying itself in knots when trying to wriggle out of admitting
520060	524540	the article may have contributed to discrimination against trans people.
524540	531100	They really do not want to admit that possibility, and so treat us to some advanced mental gymnastics.
531100	532700	See if you can follow this.
532700	537900	The BBC's guidelines on harm and defense and portrayal say that the content broadcast or
537900	542620	published by the BBC may reflect, but should not perpetuate, the prejudice which exists
542620	547980	in our society, and that output which includes views which might incite hatred or cause offense
547980	553580	must have a clear editorial justification and include appropriate challenge and or appropriate
553580	554380	context.
554380	558540	In judging how far the article complied with these editorial standards, the head of the
558540	562940	ECU first considered the extent to which it concerned behavior which would be likely to
562940	567020	convey a harmful and negative impression of those said to be engaged in it.
567020	572060	He noted that though the concept of pressure to have sex invoked by the headline could
572060	577420	be regarded as implying impropriety on the part of those supposedly applying the pressure,
577420	581660	there is nevertheless a distinction between coercion, which would generally be regarded
581660	587100	as reprehensible, and persuasion or advocacy, and that there could well be instances where
587100	592300	one party experienced as pressure what the other party regarded in good faith as legitimate
592300	593100	persuasion.
593100	597740	The article included one instance of behavior which could only be regarded as coercive,
597740	602460	if accurately reported, in the case of the unnamed respondent to the Get the L Out questionnaire
602460	606540	who claimed to have been raped by a trans woman, but there was no suggestion that this
606540	609900	reflected on the behavior of trans women in general.
609900	613740	This is the same questionnaire, let me remind you, that includes the quote,
613740	619260	"...all transsexuals rape women's bodies", but there is no suggestion that this reflects
619260	622460	on the behavior of trans women in general, of course.
622460	626220	What the BBC are saying here is that the article's original title,
626220	631820	We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Trans Women, only could be regarded as conveying
631820	636620	a harmful or negative impression of trans women because, they say, there's a distinction
636620	638940	between coercion and persuasion.
638940	644940	And as we all know, the phrase pressure into sex is exactly midway between coercion and
644940	645980	persuasion.
645980	649980	It could mean rape, it could mean flirting, who knows?
649980	653580	So, this headline has a neutral connotation, apparently.
653580	656460	It's supposed to draw you in by making you curious.
656460	660700	You're supposed to ask, oh, I wonder if they're talking about the bad version of
660700	665420	pressuring someone into sex, or the good version of pressuring someone into sex.
665420	670700	There's just no way to infer either a positive or negative connotation from these words,
670700	671340	apparently.
672140	672860	Awful.
672860	678380	Perhaps the worst instance of the BBC deliberately overlooking blatant transphobia comes when
678380	680860	they say that the head of the ECU, quote,
680860	686940	"...found no example of misgendering or bio-essentialist language in the author's own words."
687580	691900	Well, head of the ECU, allow me to point one out for you.
691900	696380	Some complainants drew attention to what they regarded as misgendering or bio-essentialist
696380	698540	language offensive to trans people.
698540	703660	Of the examples given, one seemed to the head of the ECU to rest on a misconception.
703660	706060	The contributor, Jenny, was quoted as saying,
706140	720780	However, Jenny said nothing to indicate that the comments in question were made by a transwoman,
720780	724700	and the head of the ECU saw no basis for assuming that they had been.
724700	728940	Consequently, he did not accept that this was an instance of misgendering.
728940	731420	So, fair enough, so far.
731420	734940	Maybe when this contributor used they to refer to someone else,
734940	741020	she wasn't referring to a transwoman, and so using they was justified and therefore not misgendering.
741020	744300	However, there is a very similar case in the article that goes
744300	748060	completely unmentioned in the ECU response, and it's this.
748060	753740	Another reported a transwoman physically forcing her to have sex after they went on a date.
754380	761340	They threatened to out me as a TERF and risk my job if I refused to sleep with them, she wrote, and so on.
761340	765740	Now, the article says they in brackets here because the original quote from the
765740	768780	Get the L Out survey uses he, of course.
768780	774780	So, the author of this piece, Carolyn Lowbridge, identified someone as a transwoman in the text,
774780	780460	and then in her own words changed the pronoun used to refer to that person to they.
780460	785500	Now, whatever we think of that, the head of the ECU describes this as misgendering,
785500	791020	and this passage certainly wasn't missed because the quote is referred to elsewhere in the response.
791020	797020	So, what's happened here is that the BBC received a bunch of complaints about the article misgendering transwomen,
797020	802700	and has chosen to deliberately attribute all of those complaints to one instance in which there is ambiguity
802700	807660	as to the gender of the person being described, and then they completely ignored another instance
807660	809820	in which there is no such ambiguity.
809820	814780	And I'd ask that you remember this bit of the video, because it's gonna come up again at the end.
814780	821340	I want now to talk about the point I mentioned earlier when talking about the decision to change the headline of the article,
821340	824620	and let me first quote you a section of the ECU response.
824620	829340	Some complainants argued that it was inaccurate and misleading for the author to write,
829340	837420	In addition to Veronica Ivey, I contacted several other high-profile transwomen who have either written or spoken about sex and relationships.
837420	842380	None of them wanted to speak to me, on the grounds that Chelsea Poe had agreed to be interviewed,
842380	846540	though in the event no extracts from the interview were used in the article.
846540	853500	Whether the description high-profile fits a particular transwoman is clearly a matter of judgment in which there may be a subjective element.
853500	860140	Now, we've been through this before, there is in fact no subjective element if you name other supposedly high-profile sources
860140	865180	who have a smaller profile than Chelsea Poe, but that's not actually what I'm interested in here.
865180	867340	You see, this response goes on to say,
867340	871820	Nor did he believe the question materially affected the point being made by the author,
871820	876700	based as it was on contacting ten transwomen she regarded as high-profile,
876700	883020	and who would have represented the view that lesbians should be open to dating transwomen.
883020	887340	Now, this is what I want to examine here in relation to the change in headline.
887340	895820	This article seeks to describe a division between cis lesbians and transwomen in a way that is clearly unfavorable to transwomen.
895820	901020	And as such, the original headline of the article suited that intent perfectly.
901020	906220	Cis lesbians versus transwomen is how the article is framing its debate.
906220	914140	So, with cis lesbians providing one view, the author obviously reaches out to transwomen to provide the opposing view.
914140	917340	But now, with the headline change, the BBC is saying,
917340	919740	Oh no, you got the wrong end of the stick there.
919740	923820	This article isn't about transwomen pressuring people into sex,
923820	928140	it's actually mainly about cis lesbians who don't want to date transwomen
928140	931580	feeling an indirect social pressure to do so.
931580	935740	Now, if this is the case, the group who should be being contacted by the author
935740	939500	to provide the opposing view here is not transwomen at all.
939500	943740	It's cis lesbians who are open to dating transwomen,
943740	948620	and or those who don't feel a specific social pressure to do so.
948620	951180	They should be offering the other opinion here.
951180	956140	Because, as we know, many cis lesbians are fine with dating transwomen.
956140	959180	But not one of them is quoted in the article.
959180	964060	There's no mention that the author attempted to contact anyone who fits that description,
964060	969660	or did any research at all into the views of cis lesbians who are fine with dating transwomen.
969660	973500	There's no, none of them wanted to speak to me excuse this time.
973500	976860	They're not in the article because the author didn't contact them,
976860	980940	because it would have undermined the actual reason the article exists,
980940	983020	which is to hurt transwomen.
983020	988780	To sum up my point here, if the article exists for the reason the BBC says it does,
988780	993020	then they have completely failed the basic journalistic responsibility
993020	995420	to provide an alternate point of view.
995420	998220	Now, I've got many more points I could make about this response,
998220	1002060	but my last main one is to note that the head of the ECU disagrees
1002060	1006940	that Chelsea Poe informed the BBC about the actions and opinions of Lilycade
1006940	1008940	prior to the article's publication.
1008940	1013260	But frankly, after considering all the other deliberate oversights in this response,
1013260	1018140	I just don't trust the BBC to hear something that they don't want to hear.
1018140	1022140	I don't trust their evaluation of what counts as transphobia,
1022140	1026540	and given that the BBC refuses to release the audio of the interview with Chelsea Poe,
1026540	1031580	I hope that Ofcom are willing and able to investigate the actual truth there.
1031580	1034940	Which brings us to the next step in the complaints process,
1034940	1039740	which is to talk to Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator.
1039740	1043340	I'll post a link below to their complaints form, which looks like this,
1043340	1047260	and I'd encourage anyone who's been along for the ride so far to fill out that form,
1047260	1049420	if they have the inclination to, of course.
1049420	1053660	Ofcom will usually only respond if you've already complained to the BBC,
1053660	1058620	and the BBC has issued a final word on the matter, which has now happened in this case.
1058620	1062620	Now, how you fill out this form is going to be specific to your own individual complaints
1062620	1065420	about the article, but I will give a couple of notes.
1065420	1069980	Firstly, if you have your BBC response case number, remember to include that.
1069980	1073580	It will be in the email correspondence that you got from the BBC.
1073580	1078300	Next, Ofcom appears to require you to submit the BBC's final response to you
1078300	1081340	in the form of an attachment, which is weird.
1081340	1085260	It's on the BBC's website, and I tried to just link to it,
1085260	1088460	but it wouldn't let me proceed without attaching something.
1088460	1091580	You should be able to download the email from the BBC
1091580	1095180	pointing you to the ECU response as a file, and then attach that.
1095900	1100780	Failing that, you can copy the text of the BBC response into a word processor document,
1100780	1103260	save it, and attach that file, I suppose.
1103980	1106780	But I'm not just going to be contacting Ofcom today.
1106780	1110220	I'm also going to be submitting a new complaint to the BBC,
1110220	1112940	a complaint about the ECU response.
1112940	1117500	This complaint is going to be about the issue of misgendering that we talked about earlier.
1117500	1120140	You see, the Executive Complaints Unit got lazy
1120140	1122940	when trying to dismiss the complaints about misgendering,
1122940	1125260	and they argued themselves into a corner.
1125260	1129260	As we talked about earlier, they pretended all instances of misgendering
1129260	1134460	were referencing a use of the word they when referring to someone whose gender is unknown,
1134460	1137500	and they ignored the times the author uses they in brackets
1137500	1141580	to refer to someone she has already identified as a trans woman.
1141580	1144140	And let me be candid about the strategy here.
1144140	1147660	You might say, why focus on only one instance of misgendering,
1147660	1149900	considering the many other problems with the response?
1149900	1153660	But my aim here is to make them amend the article again,
1153660	1156380	because the more times they have to amend the article,
1156380	1160540	the closer they will get, I hope, to giving up on it and taking it down.
1160540	1162620	And by focusing on only one issue,
1162620	1167660	I hope to avoid giving them opportunities to wriggle out of offering a specific response.
1167660	1169340	If I complain about ten things,
1169340	1172780	they'll only respond to the few things they feel most able to counter,
1172780	1174300	and the rest will be lost.
1174300	1179420	So I'm hoping to exploit the misstep in the ECU response with a precision strike.
1179420	1182620	I'm going to be complaining only about their ignoring of an instance
1182620	1186300	of what can be proved by their own statements to be misgendering.
1186300	1188700	I'll include the text of my new complaint below,
1188700	1192780	and would highly, highly recommend that, if you feel like it,
1192780	1197340	you also contact the BBC with your own complaint about this ECU response,
1197340	1201420	either on the same issue or any other issue that you'd like to focus on.
1201420	1205260	I will put the link to their complaints page in the video description below.
1205260	1208300	I know I'm asking a lot of you all with all of these complaints,
1208300	1212060	but we've got them on the run right now, so let's keep the pressure up.
1212060	1214220	So I'm going to go to the complaints link below,
1214220	1216860	I'm going to select BBC website or apps,
1216860	1219260	another BBC website or app,
1219260	1223340	I'm going to paste the link to the ECU response, which is included below.
1223340	1226460	Then, are you contacting us about a previous complaint?
1226460	1227020	No.
1227020	1231420	On the next page, I'm going to select factual error or inaccuracy, I suppose,
1231420	1236620	and for a title, I'm going with ECU finding ignores instance of misgendering.
1236620	1240780	In the next box, I'm going to paste the text of my complaint, which you can read below,
1240780	1245420	and then I'm going to select, do you require a response to your complaint? Yes.
1245420	1247580	So, here's to another six months.
1247580	1249740	With how slow the BBC have been replying,
1249740	1253740	we'll probably be elevating this new complaint to Ofcom around Christmas.
1253740	1255660	Thanks a lot for watching, folks.
1255660	1257660	One more note before I go, though.
1257660	1261740	I'd like to make clear that I'm not the only person kicking up a fuss here.
1261740	1263980	Lots of people, particularly trans people,
1263980	1268060	have been doing a much better job than I can raising awareness about this article,
1268060	1273820	and I particularly point to Trans Activism UK's excellent written response to the ECU response,
1273820	1275340	which I will also link below.
1275340	1280380	I just thought I'd mention that here after seeing a few comments about me leading a charge and such.
1281020	1283180	I am supporting a charge.
1283180	1285660	I'm just part of a general charge.
1286460	1289580	Right. Thanks, folks. I'll see you next time.
