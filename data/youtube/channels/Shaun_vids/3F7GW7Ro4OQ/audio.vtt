00:00.000 --> 00:01.200
Hello, everyone.

00:01.200 --> 00:08.640
This video is part four in a series of videos about a deeply transphobic article that was posted by the BBC on their website.

00:09.080 --> 00:15.040
I'd recommend that you go and watch those three first if you need to get up to speed, since I'm gonna jump right in at

00:15.040 --> 00:15.800
the deep end here.

00:15.800 --> 00:21.920
But do not worry if you watch those videos and get the impression that you may have missed out on the opportunity to complain,

00:22.240 --> 00:26.100
because, as always, there is something new to complain about today.

00:26.180 --> 00:31.540
So, the BBC have finally responded to the complaints sent to their Executive Complaints Unit,

00:31.540 --> 00:35.760
and they did so in a general statement posted to their complaints page titled

00:44.340 --> 00:49.860
This is a long statement that seeks to address various different complaints that were raised against the article,

00:49.860 --> 00:52.620
and if we're being nice, we can call it a mixed bag.

00:52.780 --> 00:57.900
So, let's start with what I suppose we can call the good news and talk about the two major

00:58.260 --> 01:00.260
concessions that have been made by the BBC.

01:00.940 --> 01:02.940
Firstly, the response says

01:22.620 --> 01:27.020
...beyond pressure applied by trans women, whereas its focus was at least as much on

01:27.020 --> 01:35.500
internalized pressure experienced by some lesbians as a result of a climate of opinion as they perceived it within the LGBT community,

01:35.500 --> 01:38.940
rather than pressure directly applied by trans women.

01:38.940 --> 01:44.380
In the head of the ECU's view, the headline gave a somewhat misleading impression of the article itself,

01:44.380 --> 01:50.940
and it appeared from many of the complaints that this had contributed to an understanding of the article as more focused on the conduct of

01:50.940 --> 01:56.620
trans women than was in fact the case. To that extent, it fell below the BBC's standards of

01:56.620 --> 02:01.340
geo-accuracy. And as a result of this, the title of the article has been changed to

02:01.340 --> 02:06.140
...the lesbians who feel pressured to have sex and relationships with trans women.

02:06.140 --> 02:10.380
And this is a point I discussed way back in my first video about this article.

02:10.380 --> 02:15.900
The original title gave the impression that pressure was being applied by trans women specifically,

02:15.900 --> 02:21.420
but then the article and attached survey fail to evidence this, spending much more time talking

02:21.420 --> 02:28.460
about an indirect social pressure felt by certain cis lesbians. So the BBC have changed the headline

02:28.460 --> 02:33.020
of the article to make it more accurate to what they now claim the article is about.

02:33.020 --> 02:37.660
I say what they now claim the article is about because I'm not willing to go along with their

02:37.660 --> 02:43.340
logic that the original headline was not suited to the article's intent. Whatever they claim the

02:43.340 --> 02:49.340
article is about now, its intent is to attack trans women and launder anti-trans propaganda

02:49.340 --> 02:53.900
from hate groups that want to take away the rights of trans people. It is not the case,

02:53.900 --> 02:58.940
as the BBC would now have you believe, that the article is in fact about something else.

02:58.940 --> 03:04.140
It is intended to paint trans women as villains, they just failed to properly evidence the claim,

03:04.140 --> 03:09.100
and so now they've been forced to change the headline. Also, if we go along with the BBC's

03:09.100 --> 03:14.380
claim here that the topic under discussion is actually a pressure felt by cis lesbians rather

03:14.380 --> 03:19.740
than a pressure applied by trans women, then a whole new problem arises with the article.

03:19.740 --> 03:24.460
But let's put a pin in that for a second and first talk about the other concession from the BBC,

03:24.460 --> 03:28.060
which concerns the Get the L Out questionnaire. And I quote,

03:28.060 --> 03:33.660
The Get the L Out questionnaire's findings, as reported in the article, for example that 56%

03:33.660 --> 03:38.460
of those who responded reported being pressured or coerced to accept a trans woman as a sexual

03:38.460 --> 03:42.540
partner, tended to give the impression that pressure to have sex with trans women,

03:42.540 --> 03:46.140
whether from individual trans women or from an activist consensus,

03:46.140 --> 03:49.980
was a widespread or even a majority experience among lesbians.

03:49.980 --> 03:55.260
In the head of the ECU's judgement, however, it provided an insufficient basis for that impression.

03:55.260 --> 04:00.060
The questionnaire was sent to a small number of women-only and lesbian-only groups,

04:00.060 --> 04:03.740
and only around a third of its 80 respondents were from the UK.

04:03.740 --> 04:08.540
The article included some caveats. However, these did not seem to us to go far enough to

04:08.540 --> 04:13.340
make clear to readers the survey's lack of statistical validity, or the extent to which

04:13.340 --> 04:17.580
Get the L Out has an agenda, which the results of the survey appear to serve.

04:17.580 --> 04:22.460
To the extent that the article failed to exercise the appropriate degree of skepticism in its

04:22.460 --> 04:26.780
treatment of the survey, it fell below the BBC's standards of geo-accuracy.

04:26.780 --> 04:31.020
And as a result of this finding, the article has been amended to include a description of the

04:31.100 --> 04:35.660
survey as being not statistically valid. Now, this is a relative good,

04:35.660 --> 04:39.100
but it still falls short of the only acceptable response here,

04:39.100 --> 04:42.700
which is to delete the entire article and apologize.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.820
I mean, it's getting a bit embarrassing, right?

04:45.820 --> 04:49.980
If we consider the whole article's history, they've had to drop their biggest contributor

04:49.980 --> 04:53.660
for being a transphobe with a history of sexually assaulting women.

04:53.660 --> 04:58.300
They've been forced to change the title for falling below their standards of geo-accuracy.

04:58.300 --> 05:03.100
They've had to admit their main source of data is biased and statistically invalid.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.900
So why does this article still exist?

05:05.900 --> 05:10.620
The ECU response even concludes that, despite all this, the piece is still, quote,

05:10.620 --> 05:13.420
a legitimate piece of journalism overall.

05:13.420 --> 05:18.300
And I'd like to remind everyone of the BBC's earlier response to the initial complaints

05:18.300 --> 05:22.700
sent about the article, where they claimed the article was carefully considered before

05:22.700 --> 05:26.940
publication and went through an internal editorial review process.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.260
And did it? Because,

05:29.260 --> 05:34.140
and I'm forced to point out the obvious here, but they didn't do a very good job, did they?

05:34.140 --> 05:38.460
Not only did they not catch the instances in which the ECU response declares the

05:38.460 --> 05:42.140
article to have fallen below the BBC's accuracy standards,

05:42.140 --> 05:47.260
Lily Cade's sexual assault allegations were public knowledge before this article was published,

05:47.260 --> 05:49.020
and they didn't catch that either.

05:49.020 --> 05:53.740
I think the BBC's internal review process needs an external review,

05:53.740 --> 05:57.180
because this article never should have made it to publication.

05:57.180 --> 06:03.180
And I really dislike the slimy way they refuse to admit anything they'd have to issue an apology for.

06:03.180 --> 06:06.620
For instance, on the issue of Lily Cade's sexual assault allegations,

06:06.620 --> 06:12.060
they merely say they escaped attention, and then later they came to light.

06:12.060 --> 06:18.060
Yes, they came to light when people did your job for you and told you about publicly available

06:18.060 --> 06:21.660
information that you could have discovered with a basic Google search.

06:22.300 --> 06:26.940
Internal editorial review process. My foot.

06:26.940 --> 06:28.780
So, that was the good news.

06:28.780 --> 06:32.940
Now let's talk about the points where I disagree with the ECU response.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.060
And there's a few of these.

06:34.620 --> 06:38.780
And in no particular order, let's start with their defense of the decision to not mention

06:38.780 --> 06:41.660
the reasons why Lily Cade was cut from the article.

06:41.660 --> 06:42.780
And I quote,

06:42.780 --> 06:47.420
A number of complainants considered the update did not give sufficient detail of the reason

06:47.420 --> 06:52.780
why Miss Cade's contribution had been removed, but the BBC has to consider how to describe offensive

06:52.780 --> 06:58.140
material without repeating and perpetuating any offense it may cause, and the head of the ECU

06:58.140 --> 07:02.300
believed the absence of detail was justified in this instance.

07:02.300 --> 07:05.740
Now this response reveals a blatant double standard.

07:05.740 --> 07:08.780
If we consider this claim in isolation, we can say,

07:08.780 --> 07:14.460
sure, maybe, to avoid causing offense, the BBC didn't want to bring up Lily Cade's violent

07:14.460 --> 07:20.060
threats and sexual assaults unnecessarily, so they simply used euphemisms and called them

07:20.060 --> 07:22.700
comments and inappropriate behavior.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.660
Fair enough.

07:23.660 --> 07:27.020
However, we're not considering this claim in isolation.

07:27.020 --> 07:31.980
This amendment is attached to an article which contains several descriptions of both violent

07:31.980 --> 07:34.140
threats and sexual assaults.

07:34.140 --> 07:38.220
The first sentence of the article is describing a death threat, in fact,

07:38.220 --> 07:40.860
and none of these are described euphemistically.

07:40.860 --> 07:46.140
So why does the BBC's responsibility to describe offensive material without repeating and

07:46.140 --> 07:49.580
perpetuating any offense it may cause not apply here?

07:49.580 --> 07:53.900
Why isn't there an absence of detail when it comes to the violence and sexual assault

07:53.900 --> 07:55.980
described in the text of the article?

07:55.980 --> 08:00.700
The answer to these rhetorical questions is that whatever the BBC says, the point of this

08:00.700 --> 08:06.780
article is to attack trans women and paint them as presenting some unique danger to cis lesbians,

08:06.780 --> 08:11.340
and describing Lily Cade's behaviors would undermine that point.

08:11.340 --> 08:15.180
So it's okay to talk about death threats and rape when you're attributing those things

08:15.180 --> 08:21.180
to anonymous trans women, but when it's a cis lesbian doing those things, those exact

08:21.180 --> 08:22.460
same things.

08:22.460 --> 08:27.340
Suddenly, after thousands of words of talking about these topics openly, we're now all

08:27.340 --> 08:31.980
of a sudden concerned about offense, so we can't repeat what Lily Cade did to get removed

08:31.980 --> 08:33.260
from the article.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.100
What a load of shit.

08:35.100 --> 08:40.060
The ECU response really starts tying itself in knots when trying to wriggle out of admitting

08:40.060 --> 08:44.540
the article may have contributed to discrimination against trans people.

08:44.540 --> 08:51.100
They really do not want to admit that possibility, and so treat us to some advanced mental gymnastics.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.700
See if you can follow this.

08:52.700 --> 08:57.900
The BBC's guidelines on harm and defense and portrayal say that the content broadcast or

08:57.900 --> 09:02.620
published by the BBC may reflect, but should not perpetuate, the prejudice which exists

09:02.620 --> 09:07.980
in our society, and that output which includes views which might incite hatred or cause offense

09:07.980 --> 09:13.580
must have a clear editorial justification and include appropriate challenge and or appropriate

09:13.580 --> 09:14.380
context.

09:14.380 --> 09:18.540
In judging how far the article complied with these editorial standards, the head of the

09:18.540 --> 09:22.940
ECU first considered the extent to which it concerned behavior which would be likely to

09:22.940 --> 09:27.020
convey a harmful and negative impression of those said to be engaged in it.

09:27.020 --> 09:32.060
He noted that though the concept of pressure to have sex invoked by the headline could

09:32.060 --> 09:37.420
be regarded as implying impropriety on the part of those supposedly applying the pressure,

09:37.420 --> 09:41.660
there is nevertheless a distinction between coercion, which would generally be regarded

09:41.660 --> 09:47.100
as reprehensible, and persuasion or advocacy, and that there could well be instances where

09:47.100 --> 09:52.300
one party experienced as pressure what the other party regarded in good faith as legitimate

09:52.300 --> 09:53.100
persuasion.

09:53.100 --> 09:57.740
The article included one instance of behavior which could only be regarded as coercive,

09:57.740 --> 10:02.460
if accurately reported, in the case of the unnamed respondent to the Get the L Out questionnaire

10:02.460 --> 10:06.540
who claimed to have been raped by a trans woman, but there was no suggestion that this

10:06.540 --> 10:09.900
reflected on the behavior of trans women in general.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.740
This is the same questionnaire, let me remind you, that includes the quote,

10:13.740 --> 10:19.260
"...all transsexuals rape women's bodies", but there is no suggestion that this reflects

10:19.260 --> 10:22.460
on the behavior of trans women in general, of course.

10:22.460 --> 10:26.220
What the BBC are saying here is that the article's original title,

10:26.220 --> 10:31.820
We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Trans Women, only could be regarded as conveying

10:31.820 --> 10:36.620
a harmful or negative impression of trans women because, they say, there's a distinction

10:36.620 --> 10:38.940
between coercion and persuasion.

10:38.940 --> 10:44.940
And as we all know, the phrase pressure into sex is exactly midway between coercion and

10:44.940 --> 10:45.980
persuasion.

10:45.980 --> 10:49.980
It could mean rape, it could mean flirting, who knows?

10:49.980 --> 10:53.580
So, this headline has a neutral connotation, apparently.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.460
It's supposed to draw you in by making you curious.

10:56.460 --> 11:00.700
You're supposed to ask, oh, I wonder if they're talking about the bad version of

11:00.700 --> 11:05.420
pressuring someone into sex, or the good version of pressuring someone into sex.

11:05.420 --> 11:10.700
There's just no way to infer either a positive or negative connotation from these words,

11:10.700 --> 11:11.340
apparently.

11:12.140 --> 11:12.860
Awful.

11:12.860 --> 11:18.380
Perhaps the worst instance of the BBC deliberately overlooking blatant transphobia comes when

11:18.380 --> 11:20.860
they say that the head of the ECU, quote,

11:20.860 --> 11:26.940
"...found no example of misgendering or bio-essentialist language in the author's own words."

11:27.580 --> 11:31.900
Well, head of the ECU, allow me to point one out for you.

11:31.900 --> 11:36.380
Some complainants drew attention to what they regarded as misgendering or bio-essentialist

11:36.380 --> 11:38.540
language offensive to trans people.

11:38.540 --> 11:43.660
Of the examples given, one seemed to the head of the ECU to rest on a misconception.

11:43.660 --> 11:46.060
The contributor, Jenny, was quoted as saying,

11:46.140 --> 12:00.780
However, Jenny said nothing to indicate that the comments in question were made by a transwoman,

12:00.780 --> 12:04.700
and the head of the ECU saw no basis for assuming that they had been.

12:04.700 --> 12:08.940
Consequently, he did not accept that this was an instance of misgendering.

12:08.940 --> 12:11.420
So, fair enough, so far.

12:11.420 --> 12:14.940
Maybe when this contributor used they to refer to someone else,

12:14.940 --> 12:21.020
she wasn't referring to a transwoman, and so using they was justified and therefore not misgendering.

12:21.020 --> 12:24.300
However, there is a very similar case in the article that goes

12:24.300 --> 12:28.060
completely unmentioned in the ECU response, and it's this.

12:28.060 --> 12:33.740
Another reported a transwoman physically forcing her to have sex after they went on a date.

12:34.380 --> 12:41.340
They threatened to out me as a TERF and risk my job if I refused to sleep with them, she wrote, and so on.

12:41.340 --> 12:45.740
Now, the article says they in brackets here because the original quote from the

12:45.740 --> 12:48.780
Get the L Out survey uses he, of course.

12:48.780 --> 12:54.780
So, the author of this piece, Carolyn Lowbridge, identified someone as a transwoman in the text,

12:54.780 --> 13:00.460
and then in her own words changed the pronoun used to refer to that person to they.

13:00.460 --> 13:05.500
Now, whatever we think of that, the head of the ECU describes this as misgendering,

13:05.500 --> 13:11.020
and this passage certainly wasn't missed because the quote is referred to elsewhere in the response.

13:11.020 --> 13:17.020
So, what's happened here is that the BBC received a bunch of complaints about the article misgendering transwomen,

13:17.020 --> 13:22.700
and has chosen to deliberately attribute all of those complaints to one instance in which there is ambiguity

13:22.700 --> 13:27.660
as to the gender of the person being described, and then they completely ignored another instance

13:27.660 --> 13:29.820
in which there is no such ambiguity.

13:29.820 --> 13:34.780
And I'd ask that you remember this bit of the video, because it's gonna come up again at the end.

13:34.780 --> 13:41.340
I want now to talk about the point I mentioned earlier when talking about the decision to change the headline of the article,

13:41.340 --> 13:44.620
and let me first quote you a section of the ECU response.

13:44.620 --> 13:49.340
Some complainants argued that it was inaccurate and misleading for the author to write,

13:49.340 --> 13:57.420
In addition to Veronica Ivey, I contacted several other high-profile transwomen who have either written or spoken about sex and relationships.

13:57.420 --> 14:02.380
None of them wanted to speak to me, on the grounds that Chelsea Poe had agreed to be interviewed,

14:02.380 --> 14:06.540
though in the event no extracts from the interview were used in the article.

14:06.540 --> 14:13.500
Whether the description high-profile fits a particular transwoman is clearly a matter of judgment in which there may be a subjective element.

14:13.500 --> 14:20.140
Now, we've been through this before, there is in fact no subjective element if you name other supposedly high-profile sources

14:20.140 --> 14:25.180
who have a smaller profile than Chelsea Poe, but that's not actually what I'm interested in here.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.340
You see, this response goes on to say,

14:27.340 --> 14:31.820
Nor did he believe the question materially affected the point being made by the author,

14:31.820 --> 14:36.700
based as it was on contacting ten transwomen she regarded as high-profile,

14:36.700 --> 14:43.020
and who would have represented the view that lesbians should be open to dating transwomen.

14:43.020 --> 14:47.340
Now, this is what I want to examine here in relation to the change in headline.

14:47.340 --> 14:55.820
This article seeks to describe a division between cis lesbians and transwomen in a way that is clearly unfavorable to transwomen.

14:55.820 --> 15:01.020
And as such, the original headline of the article suited that intent perfectly.

15:01.020 --> 15:06.220
Cis lesbians versus transwomen is how the article is framing its debate.

15:06.220 --> 15:14.140
So, with cis lesbians providing one view, the author obviously reaches out to transwomen to provide the opposing view.

15:14.140 --> 15:17.340
But now, with the headline change, the BBC is saying,

15:17.340 --> 15:19.740
Oh no, you got the wrong end of the stick there.

15:19.740 --> 15:23.820
This article isn't about transwomen pressuring people into sex,

15:23.820 --> 15:28.140
it's actually mainly about cis lesbians who don't want to date transwomen

15:28.140 --> 15:31.580
feeling an indirect social pressure to do so.

15:31.580 --> 15:35.740
Now, if this is the case, the group who should be being contacted by the author

15:35.740 --> 15:39.500
to provide the opposing view here is not transwomen at all.

15:39.500 --> 15:43.740
It's cis lesbians who are open to dating transwomen,

15:43.740 --> 15:48.620
and or those who don't feel a specific social pressure to do so.

15:48.620 --> 15:51.180
They should be offering the other opinion here.

15:51.180 --> 15:56.140
Because, as we know, many cis lesbians are fine with dating transwomen.

15:56.140 --> 15:59.180
But not one of them is quoted in the article.

15:59.180 --> 16:04.060
There's no mention that the author attempted to contact anyone who fits that description,

16:04.060 --> 16:09.660
or did any research at all into the views of cis lesbians who are fine with dating transwomen.

16:09.660 --> 16:13.500
There's no, none of them wanted to speak to me excuse this time.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.860
They're not in the article because the author didn't contact them,

16:16.860 --> 16:20.940
because it would have undermined the actual reason the article exists,

16:20.940 --> 16:23.020
which is to hurt transwomen.

16:23.020 --> 16:28.780
To sum up my point here, if the article exists for the reason the BBC says it does,

16:28.780 --> 16:33.020
then they have completely failed the basic journalistic responsibility

16:33.020 --> 16:35.420
to provide an alternate point of view.

16:35.420 --> 16:38.220
Now, I've got many more points I could make about this response,

16:38.220 --> 16:42.060
but my last main one is to note that the head of the ECU disagrees

16:42.060 --> 16:46.940
that Chelsea Poe informed the BBC about the actions and opinions of Lilycade

16:46.940 --> 16:48.940
prior to the article's publication.

16:48.940 --> 16:53.260
But frankly, after considering all the other deliberate oversights in this response,

16:53.260 --> 16:58.140
I just don't trust the BBC to hear something that they don't want to hear.

16:58.140 --> 17:02.140
I don't trust their evaluation of what counts as transphobia,

17:02.140 --> 17:06.540
and given that the BBC refuses to release the audio of the interview with Chelsea Poe,

17:06.540 --> 17:11.580
I hope that Ofcom are willing and able to investigate the actual truth there.

17:11.580 --> 17:14.940
Which brings us to the next step in the complaints process,

17:14.940 --> 17:19.740
which is to talk to Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator.

17:19.740 --> 17:23.340
I'll post a link below to their complaints form, which looks like this,

17:23.340 --> 17:27.260
and I'd encourage anyone who's been along for the ride so far to fill out that form,

17:27.260 --> 17:29.420
if they have the inclination to, of course.

17:29.420 --> 17:33.660
Ofcom will usually only respond if you've already complained to the BBC,

17:33.660 --> 17:38.620
and the BBC has issued a final word on the matter, which has now happened in this case.

17:38.620 --> 17:42.620
Now, how you fill out this form is going to be specific to your own individual complaints

17:42.620 --> 17:45.420
about the article, but I will give a couple of notes.

17:45.420 --> 17:49.980
Firstly, if you have your BBC response case number, remember to include that.

17:49.980 --> 17:53.580
It will be in the email correspondence that you got from the BBC.

17:53.580 --> 17:58.300
Next, Ofcom appears to require you to submit the BBC's final response to you

17:58.300 --> 18:01.340
in the form of an attachment, which is weird.

18:01.340 --> 18:05.260
It's on the BBC's website, and I tried to just link to it,

18:05.260 --> 18:08.460
but it wouldn't let me proceed without attaching something.

18:08.460 --> 18:11.580
You should be able to download the email from the BBC

18:11.580 --> 18:15.180
pointing you to the ECU response as a file, and then attach that.

18:15.900 --> 18:20.780
Failing that, you can copy the text of the BBC response into a word processor document,

18:20.780 --> 18:23.260
save it, and attach that file, I suppose.

18:23.980 --> 18:26.780
But I'm not just going to be contacting Ofcom today.

18:26.780 --> 18:30.220
I'm also going to be submitting a new complaint to the BBC,

18:30.220 --> 18:32.940
a complaint about the ECU response.

18:32.940 --> 18:37.500
This complaint is going to be about the issue of misgendering that we talked about earlier.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.140
You see, the Executive Complaints Unit got lazy

18:40.140 --> 18:42.940
when trying to dismiss the complaints about misgendering,

18:42.940 --> 18:45.260
and they argued themselves into a corner.

18:45.260 --> 18:49.260
As we talked about earlier, they pretended all instances of misgendering

18:49.260 --> 18:54.460
were referencing a use of the word they when referring to someone whose gender is unknown,

18:54.460 --> 18:57.500
and they ignored the times the author uses they in brackets

18:57.500 --> 19:01.580
to refer to someone she has already identified as a trans woman.

19:01.580 --> 19:04.140
And let me be candid about the strategy here.

19:04.140 --> 19:07.660
You might say, why focus on only one instance of misgendering,

19:07.660 --> 19:09.900
considering the many other problems with the response?

19:09.900 --> 19:13.660
But my aim here is to make them amend the article again,

19:13.660 --> 19:16.380
because the more times they have to amend the article,

19:16.380 --> 19:20.540
the closer they will get, I hope, to giving up on it and taking it down.

19:20.540 --> 19:22.620
And by focusing on only one issue,

19:22.620 --> 19:27.660
I hope to avoid giving them opportunities to wriggle out of offering a specific response.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.340
If I complain about ten things,

19:29.340 --> 19:32.780
they'll only respond to the few things they feel most able to counter,

19:32.780 --> 19:34.300
and the rest will be lost.

19:34.300 --> 19:39.420
So I'm hoping to exploit the misstep in the ECU response with a precision strike.

19:39.420 --> 19:42.620
I'm going to be complaining only about their ignoring of an instance

19:42.620 --> 19:46.300
of what can be proved by their own statements to be misgendering.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.700
I'll include the text of my new complaint below,

19:48.700 --> 19:52.780
and would highly, highly recommend that, if you feel like it,

19:52.780 --> 19:57.340
you also contact the BBC with your own complaint about this ECU response,

19:57.340 --> 20:01.420
either on the same issue or any other issue that you'd like to focus on.

20:01.420 --> 20:05.260
I will put the link to their complaints page in the video description below.

20:05.260 --> 20:08.300
I know I'm asking a lot of you all with all of these complaints,

20:08.300 --> 20:12.060
but we've got them on the run right now, so let's keep the pressure up.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.220
So I'm going to go to the complaints link below,

20:14.220 --> 20:16.860
I'm going to select BBC website or apps,

20:16.860 --> 20:19.260
another BBC website or app,

20:19.260 --> 20:23.340
I'm going to paste the link to the ECU response, which is included below.

20:23.340 --> 20:26.460
Then, are you contacting us about a previous complaint?

20:26.460 --> 20:27.020
No.

20:27.020 --> 20:31.420
On the next page, I'm going to select factual error or inaccuracy, I suppose,

20:31.420 --> 20:36.620
and for a title, I'm going with ECU finding ignores instance of misgendering.

20:36.620 --> 20:40.780
In the next box, I'm going to paste the text of my complaint, which you can read below,

20:40.780 --> 20:45.420
and then I'm going to select, do you require a response to your complaint? Yes.

20:45.420 --> 20:47.580
So, here's to another six months.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.740
With how slow the BBC have been replying,

20:49.740 --> 20:53.740
we'll probably be elevating this new complaint to Ofcom around Christmas.

20:53.740 --> 20:55.660
Thanks a lot for watching, folks.

20:55.660 --> 20:57.660
One more note before I go, though.

20:57.660 --> 21:01.740
I'd like to make clear that I'm not the only person kicking up a fuss here.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.980
Lots of people, particularly trans people,

21:03.980 --> 21:08.060
have been doing a much better job than I can raising awareness about this article,

21:08.060 --> 21:13.820
and I particularly point to Trans Activism UK's excellent written response to the ECU response,

21:13.820 --> 21:15.340
which I will also link below.

21:15.340 --> 21:20.380
I just thought I'd mention that here after seeing a few comments about me leading a charge and such.

21:21.020 --> 21:23.180
I am supporting a charge.

21:23.180 --> 21:25.660
I'm just part of a general charge.

21:26.460 --> 21:29.580
Right. Thanks, folks. I'll see you next time.
