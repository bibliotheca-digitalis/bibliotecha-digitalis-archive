00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:08,640
This video is part four in a series of videos about a deeply transphobic article that was posted by the BBC on their website.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,040
I'd recommend that you go and watch those three first if you need to get up to speed, since I'm gonna jump right in at

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,800
the deep end here.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,920
But do not worry if you watch those videos and get the impression that you may have missed out on the opportunity to complain,

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,100
because, as always, there is something new to complain about today.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,540
So, the BBC have finally responded to the complaints sent to their Executive Complaints Unit,

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,760
and they did so in a general statement posted to their complaints page titled

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,860
This is a long statement that seeks to address various different complaints that were raised against the article,

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,620
and if we're being nice, we can call it a mixed bag.

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,900
So, let's start with what I suppose we can call the good news and talk about the two major

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,260
concessions that have been made by the BBC.

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,940
Firstly, the response says

14
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,020
...beyond pressure applied by trans women, whereas its focus was at least as much on

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:35,500
internalized pressure experienced by some lesbians as a result of a climate of opinion as they perceived it within the LGBT community,

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,940
rather than pressure directly applied by trans women.

17
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,380
In the head of the ECU's view, the headline gave a somewhat misleading impression of the article itself,

18
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,940
and it appeared from many of the complaints that this had contributed to an understanding of the article as more focused on the conduct of

19
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,620
trans women than was in fact the case. To that extent, it fell below the BBC's standards of

20
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,340
geo-accuracy. And as a result of this, the title of the article has been changed to

21
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,140
...the lesbians who feel pressured to have sex and relationships with trans women.

22
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,380
And this is a point I discussed way back in my first video about this article.

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,900
The original title gave the impression that pressure was being applied by trans women specifically,

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,420
but then the article and attached survey fail to evidence this, spending much more time talking

25
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,460
about an indirect social pressure felt by certain cis lesbians. So the BBC have changed the headline

26
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,020
of the article to make it more accurate to what they now claim the article is about.

27
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,660
I say what they now claim the article is about because I'm not willing to go along with their

28
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,340
logic that the original headline was not suited to the article's intent. Whatever they claim the

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,340
article is about now, its intent is to attack trans women and launder anti-trans propaganda

30
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,900
from hate groups that want to take away the rights of trans people. It is not the case,

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,940
as the BBC would now have you believe, that the article is in fact about something else.

32
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,140
It is intended to paint trans women as villains, they just failed to properly evidence the claim,

33
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,100
and so now they've been forced to change the headline. Also, if we go along with the BBC's

34
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,380
claim here that the topic under discussion is actually a pressure felt by cis lesbians rather

35
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,740
than a pressure applied by trans women, then a whole new problem arises with the article.

36
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,460
But let's put a pin in that for a second and first talk about the other concession from the BBC,

37
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,060
which concerns the Get the L Out questionnaire. And I quote,

38
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,660
The Get the L Out questionnaire's findings, as reported in the article, for example that 56%

39
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,460
of those who responded reported being pressured or coerced to accept a trans woman as a sexual

40
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,540
partner, tended to give the impression that pressure to have sex with trans women,

41
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,140
whether from individual trans women or from an activist consensus,

42
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,980
was a widespread or even a majority experience among lesbians.

43
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,260
In the head of the ECU's judgement, however, it provided an insufficient basis for that impression.

44
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,060
The questionnaire was sent to a small number of women-only and lesbian-only groups,

45
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,740
and only around a third of its 80 respondents were from the UK.

46
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,540
The article included some caveats. However, these did not seem to us to go far enough to

47
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,340
make clear to readers the survey's lack of statistical validity, or the extent to which

48
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,580
Get the L Out has an agenda, which the results of the survey appear to serve.

49
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,460
To the extent that the article failed to exercise the appropriate degree of skepticism in its

50
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,780
treatment of the survey, it fell below the BBC's standards of geo-accuracy.

51
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,020
And as a result of this finding, the article has been amended to include a description of the

52
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,660
survey as being not statistically valid. Now, this is a relative good,

53
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,100
but it still falls short of the only acceptable response here,

54
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,700
which is to delete the entire article and apologize.

55
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,820
I mean, it's getting a bit embarrassing, right?

56
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,980
If we consider the whole article's history, they've had to drop their biggest contributor

57
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,660
for being a transphobe with a history of sexually assaulting women.

58
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,300
They've been forced to change the title for falling below their standards of geo-accuracy.

59
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,100
They've had to admit their main source of data is biased and statistically invalid.

60
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,900
So why does this article still exist?

61
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,620
The ECU response even concludes that, despite all this, the piece is still, quote,

62
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,420
a legitimate piece of journalism overall.

63
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,300
And I'd like to remind everyone of the BBC's earlier response to the initial complaints

64
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,700
sent about the article, where they claimed the article was carefully considered before

65
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,940
publication and went through an internal editorial review process.

66
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,260
And did it? Because,

67
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,140
and I'm forced to point out the obvious here, but they didn't do a very good job, did they?

68
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,460
Not only did they not catch the instances in which the ECU response declares the

69
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,140
article to have fallen below the BBC's accuracy standards,

70
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,260
Lily Cade's sexual assault allegations were public knowledge before this article was published,

71
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,020
and they didn't catch that either.

72
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,740
I think the BBC's internal review process needs an external review,

73
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,180
because this article never should have made it to publication.

74
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,180
And I really dislike the slimy way they refuse to admit anything they'd have to issue an apology for.

75
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,620
For instance, on the issue of Lily Cade's sexual assault allegations,

76
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,060
they merely say they escaped attention, and then later they came to light.

77
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,060
Yes, they came to light when people did your job for you and told you about publicly available

78
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,660
information that you could have discovered with a basic Google search.

79
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,940
Internal editorial review process. My foot.

80
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,780
So, that was the good news.

81
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,940
Now let's talk about the points where I disagree with the ECU response.

82
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,060
And there's a few of these.

83
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,780
And in no particular order, let's start with their defense of the decision to not mention

84
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,660
the reasons why Lily Cade was cut from the article.

85
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,780
And I quote,

86
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,420
A number of complainants considered the update did not give sufficient detail of the reason

87
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,780
why Miss Cade's contribution had been removed, but the BBC has to consider how to describe offensive

88
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,140
material without repeating and perpetuating any offense it may cause, and the head of the ECU

89
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,300
believed the absence of detail was justified in this instance.

90
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,740
Now this response reveals a blatant double standard.

91
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,780
If we consider this claim in isolation, we can say,

92
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,460
sure, maybe, to avoid causing offense, the BBC didn't want to bring up Lily Cade's violent

93
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,060
threats and sexual assaults unnecessarily, so they simply used euphemisms and called them

94
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,700
comments and inappropriate behavior.

95
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,660
Fair enough.

96
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,020
However, we're not considering this claim in isolation.

97
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,980
This amendment is attached to an article which contains several descriptions of both violent

98
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,140
threats and sexual assaults.

99
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,220
The first sentence of the article is describing a death threat, in fact,

100
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,860
and none of these are described euphemistically.

101
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,140
So why does the BBC's responsibility to describe offensive material without repeating and

102
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,580
perpetuating any offense it may cause not apply here?

103
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,900
Why isn't there an absence of detail when it comes to the violence and sexual assault

104
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,980
described in the text of the article?

105
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,700
The answer to these rhetorical questions is that whatever the BBC says, the point of this

106
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,780
article is to attack trans women and paint them as presenting some unique danger to cis lesbians,

107
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,340
and describing Lily Cade's behaviors would undermine that point.

108
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,180
So it's okay to talk about death threats and rape when you're attributing those things

109
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,180
to anonymous trans women, but when it's a cis lesbian doing those things, those exact

110
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,460
same things.

111
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,340
Suddenly, after thousands of words of talking about these topics openly, we're now all

112
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,980
of a sudden concerned about offense, so we can't repeat what Lily Cade did to get removed

113
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,260
from the article.

114
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,100
What a load of shit.

115
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,060
The ECU response really starts tying itself in knots when trying to wriggle out of admitting

116
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,540
the article may have contributed to discrimination against trans people.

117
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:51,100
They really do not want to admit that possibility, and so treat us to some advanced mental gymnastics.

118
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,700
See if you can follow this.

119
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,900
The BBC's guidelines on harm and defense and portrayal say that the content broadcast or

120
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,620
published by the BBC may reflect, but should not perpetuate, the prejudice which exists

121
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,980
in our society, and that output which includes views which might incite hatred or cause offense

122
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,580
must have a clear editorial justification and include appropriate challenge and or appropriate

123
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,380
context.

124
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,540
In judging how far the article complied with these editorial standards, the head of the

125
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,940
ECU first considered the extent to which it concerned behavior which would be likely to

126
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,020
convey a harmful and negative impression of those said to be engaged in it.

127
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,060
He noted that though the concept of pressure to have sex invoked by the headline could

128
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,420
be regarded as implying impropriety on the part of those supposedly applying the pressure,

129
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,660
there is nevertheless a distinction between coercion, which would generally be regarded

130
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,100
as reprehensible, and persuasion or advocacy, and that there could well be instances where

131
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,300
one party experienced as pressure what the other party regarded in good faith as legitimate

132
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,100
persuasion.

133
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,740
The article included one instance of behavior which could only be regarded as coercive,

134
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,460
if accurately reported, in the case of the unnamed respondent to the Get the L Out questionnaire

135
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,540
who claimed to have been raped by a trans woman, but there was no suggestion that this

136
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,900
reflected on the behavior of trans women in general.

137
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,740
This is the same questionnaire, let me remind you, that includes the quote,

138
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,260
"...all transsexuals rape women's bodies", but there is no suggestion that this reflects

139
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,460
on the behavior of trans women in general, of course.

140
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,220
What the BBC are saying here is that the article's original title,

141
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,820
We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Trans Women, only could be regarded as conveying

142
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,620
a harmful or negative impression of trans women because, they say, there's a distinction

143
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,940
between coercion and persuasion.

144
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,940
And as we all know, the phrase pressure into sex is exactly midway between coercion and

145
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,980
persuasion.

146
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,980
It could mean rape, it could mean flirting, who knows?

147
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,580
So, this headline has a neutral connotation, apparently.

148
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,460
It's supposed to draw you in by making you curious.

149
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,700
You're supposed to ask, oh, I wonder if they're talking about the bad version of

150
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,420
pressuring someone into sex, or the good version of pressuring someone into sex.

151
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,700
There's just no way to infer either a positive or negative connotation from these words,

152
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,340
apparently.

153
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,860
Awful.

154
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,380
Perhaps the worst instance of the BBC deliberately overlooking blatant transphobia comes when

155
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,860
they say that the head of the ECU, quote,

156
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,940
"...found no example of misgendering or bio-essentialist language in the author's own words."

157
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,900
Well, head of the ECU, allow me to point one out for you.

158
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,380
Some complainants drew attention to what they regarded as misgendering or bio-essentialist

159
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,540
language offensive to trans people.

160
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,660
Of the examples given, one seemed to the head of the ECU to rest on a misconception.

161
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,060
The contributor, Jenny, was quoted as saying,

162
00:11:46,140 --> 00:12:00,780
However, Jenny said nothing to indicate that the comments in question were made by a transwoman,

163
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,700
and the head of the ECU saw no basis for assuming that they had been.

164
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,940
Consequently, he did not accept that this was an instance of misgendering.

165
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,420
So, fair enough, so far.

166
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,940
Maybe when this contributor used they to refer to someone else,

167
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,020
she wasn't referring to a transwoman, and so using they was justified and therefore not misgendering.

168
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,300
However, there is a very similar case in the article that goes

169
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,060
completely unmentioned in the ECU response, and it's this.

170
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,740
Another reported a transwoman physically forcing her to have sex after they went on a date.

171
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,340
They threatened to out me as a TERF and risk my job if I refused to sleep with them, she wrote, and so on.

172
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,740
Now, the article says they in brackets here because the original quote from the

173
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,780
Get the L Out survey uses he, of course.

174
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:54,780
So, the author of this piece, Carolyn Lowbridge, identified someone as a transwoman in the text,

175
00:12:54,780 --> 00:13:00,460
and then in her own words changed the pronoun used to refer to that person to they.

176
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,500
Now, whatever we think of that, the head of the ECU describes this as misgendering,

177
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,020
and this passage certainly wasn't missed because the quote is referred to elsewhere in the response.

178
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:17,020
So, what's happened here is that the BBC received a bunch of complaints about the article misgendering transwomen,

179
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,700
and has chosen to deliberately attribute all of those complaints to one instance in which there is ambiguity

180
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,660
as to the gender of the person being described, and then they completely ignored another instance

181
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,820
in which there is no such ambiguity.

182
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,780
And I'd ask that you remember this bit of the video, because it's gonna come up again at the end.

183
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:41,340
I want now to talk about the point I mentioned earlier when talking about the decision to change the headline of the article,

184
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,620
and let me first quote you a section of the ECU response.

185
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,340
Some complainants argued that it was inaccurate and misleading for the author to write,

186
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:57,420
In addition to Veronica Ivey, I contacted several other high-profile transwomen who have either written or spoken about sex and relationships.

187
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,380
None of them wanted to speak to me, on the grounds that Chelsea Poe had agreed to be interviewed,

188
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,540
though in the event no extracts from the interview were used in the article.

189
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:13,500
Whether the description high-profile fits a particular transwoman is clearly a matter of judgment in which there may be a subjective element.

190
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,140
Now, we've been through this before, there is in fact no subjective element if you name other supposedly high-profile sources

191
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,180
who have a smaller profile than Chelsea Poe, but that's not actually what I'm interested in here.

192
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,340
You see, this response goes on to say,

193
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,820
Nor did he believe the question materially affected the point being made by the author,

194
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,700
based as it was on contacting ten transwomen she regarded as high-profile,

195
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:43,020
and who would have represented the view that lesbians should be open to dating transwomen.

196
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,340
Now, this is what I want to examine here in relation to the change in headline.

197
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:55,820
This article seeks to describe a division between cis lesbians and transwomen in a way that is clearly unfavorable to transwomen.

198
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,020
And as such, the original headline of the article suited that intent perfectly.

199
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:06,220
Cis lesbians versus transwomen is how the article is framing its debate.

200
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:14,140
So, with cis lesbians providing one view, the author obviously reaches out to transwomen to provide the opposing view.

201
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,340
But now, with the headline change, the BBC is saying,

202
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,740
Oh no, you got the wrong end of the stick there.

203
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,820
This article isn't about transwomen pressuring people into sex,

204
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,140
it's actually mainly about cis lesbians who don't want to date transwomen

205
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,580
feeling an indirect social pressure to do so.

206
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,740
Now, if this is the case, the group who should be being contacted by the author

207
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,500
to provide the opposing view here is not transwomen at all.

208
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,740
It's cis lesbians who are open to dating transwomen,

209
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,620
and or those who don't feel a specific social pressure to do so.

210
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,180
They should be offering the other opinion here.

211
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,140
Because, as we know, many cis lesbians are fine with dating transwomen.

212
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,180
But not one of them is quoted in the article.

213
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,060
There's no mention that the author attempted to contact anyone who fits that description,

214
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,660
or did any research at all into the views of cis lesbians who are fine with dating transwomen.

215
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,500
There's no, none of them wanted to speak to me excuse this time.

216
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,860
They're not in the article because the author didn't contact them,

217
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,940
because it would have undermined the actual reason the article exists,

218
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,020
which is to hurt transwomen.

219
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,780
To sum up my point here, if the article exists for the reason the BBC says it does,

220
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,020
then they have completely failed the basic journalistic responsibility

221
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,420
to provide an alternate point of view.

222
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,220
Now, I've got many more points I could make about this response,

223
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,060
but my last main one is to note that the head of the ECU disagrees

224
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,940
that Chelsea Poe informed the BBC about the actions and opinions of Lilycade

225
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,940
prior to the article's publication.

226
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,260
But frankly, after considering all the other deliberate oversights in this response,

227
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,140
I just don't trust the BBC to hear something that they don't want to hear.

228
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,140
I don't trust their evaluation of what counts as transphobia,

229
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,540
and given that the BBC refuses to release the audio of the interview with Chelsea Poe,

230
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,580
I hope that Ofcom are willing and able to investigate the actual truth there.

231
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,940
Which brings us to the next step in the complaints process,

232
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,740
which is to talk to Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator.

233
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,340
I'll post a link below to their complaints form, which looks like this,

234
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,260
and I'd encourage anyone who's been along for the ride so far to fill out that form,

235
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,420
if they have the inclination to, of course.

236
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,660
Ofcom will usually only respond if you've already complained to the BBC,

237
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,620
and the BBC has issued a final word on the matter, which has now happened in this case.

238
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,620
Now, how you fill out this form is going to be specific to your own individual complaints

239
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,420
about the article, but I will give a couple of notes.

240
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,980
Firstly, if you have your BBC response case number, remember to include that.

241
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,580
It will be in the email correspondence that you got from the BBC.

242
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,300
Next, Ofcom appears to require you to submit the BBC's final response to you

243
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,340
in the form of an attachment, which is weird.

244
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,260
It's on the BBC's website, and I tried to just link to it,

245
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,460
but it wouldn't let me proceed without attaching something.

246
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,580
You should be able to download the email from the BBC

247
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,180
pointing you to the ECU response as a file, and then attach that.

248
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,780
Failing that, you can copy the text of the BBC response into a word processor document,

249
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,260
save it, and attach that file, I suppose.

250
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,780
But I'm not just going to be contacting Ofcom today.

251
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,220
I'm also going to be submitting a new complaint to the BBC,

252
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,940
a complaint about the ECU response.

253
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,500
This complaint is going to be about the issue of misgendering that we talked about earlier.

254
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,140
You see, the Executive Complaints Unit got lazy

255
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,940
when trying to dismiss the complaints about misgendering,

256
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,260
and they argued themselves into a corner.

257
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,260
As we talked about earlier, they pretended all instances of misgendering

258
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,460
were referencing a use of the word they when referring to someone whose gender is unknown,

259
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,500
and they ignored the times the author uses they in brackets

260
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,580
to refer to someone she has already identified as a trans woman.

261
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,140
And let me be candid about the strategy here.

262
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,660
You might say, why focus on only one instance of misgendering,

263
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,900
considering the many other problems with the response?

264
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,660
But my aim here is to make them amend the article again,

265
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,380
because the more times they have to amend the article,

266
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,540
the closer they will get, I hope, to giving up on it and taking it down.

267
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,620
And by focusing on only one issue,

268
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,660
I hope to avoid giving them opportunities to wriggle out of offering a specific response.

269
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,340
If I complain about ten things,

270
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,780
they'll only respond to the few things they feel most able to counter,

271
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,300
and the rest will be lost.

272
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,420
So I'm hoping to exploit the misstep in the ECU response with a precision strike.

273
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,620
I'm going to be complaining only about their ignoring of an instance

274
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,300
of what can be proved by their own statements to be misgendering.

275
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,700
I'll include the text of my new complaint below,

276
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,780
and would highly, highly recommend that, if you feel like it,

277
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,340
you also contact the BBC with your own complaint about this ECU response,

278
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,420
either on the same issue or any other issue that you'd like to focus on.

279
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,260
I will put the link to their complaints page in the video description below.

280
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,300
I know I'm asking a lot of you all with all of these complaints,

281
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,060
but we've got them on the run right now, so let's keep the pressure up.

282
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,220
So I'm going to go to the complaints link below,

283
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,860
I'm going to select BBC website or apps,

284
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,260
another BBC website or app,

285
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,340
I'm going to paste the link to the ECU response, which is included below.

286
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,460
Then, are you contacting us about a previous complaint?

287
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,020
No.

288
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,420
On the next page, I'm going to select factual error or inaccuracy, I suppose,

289
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,620
and for a title, I'm going with ECU finding ignores instance of misgendering.

290
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,780
In the next box, I'm going to paste the text of my complaint, which you can read below,

291
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,420
and then I'm going to select, do you require a response to your complaint? Yes.

292
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,580
So, here's to another six months.

293
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,740
With how slow the BBC have been replying,

294
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,740
we'll probably be elevating this new complaint to Ofcom around Christmas.

295
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,660
Thanks a lot for watching, folks.

296
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
One more note before I go, though.

297
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,740
I'd like to make clear that I'm not the only person kicking up a fuss here.

298
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,980
Lots of people, particularly trans people,

299
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,060
have been doing a much better job than I can raising awareness about this article,

300
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:13,820
and I particularly point to Trans Activism UK's excellent written response to the ECU response,

301
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,340
which I will also link below.

302
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,380
I just thought I'd mention that here after seeing a few comments about me leading a charge and such.

303
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,180
I am supporting a charge.

304
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,660
I'm just part of a general charge.

305
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,580
Right. Thanks, folks. I'll see you next time.
