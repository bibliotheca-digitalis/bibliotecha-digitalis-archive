0	7920	Hello there. This is a video about Stefan Molyneux, and in particular his video The Truth About the Fall of Rome
8620	16400	Modern Parallels. Now his video is two and a half hours long, but I decided to take a look at it anyway, for two main reasons.
17600	20080	Firstly, I love talking about Rome.
20080	25320	I'm a big Roman history fan, and secondly, a particular pet peeve of mine is people
25320	31760	cherry-picking from Roman history, and ancient history in general, to support some modern ideology.
31960	36100	Not that I'm suggesting we should ignore history, or that there are no specific
36360	42120	parallels between the ancient world and the modern, because I think there are plenty of legitimate points of comparison.
42240	48540	Nor do I have any problem in particular with historical revisionism, if it's done for the right reasons.
48540	53920	If you find new evidence to support or disprove some facets of current historical knowledge,
54400	56400	excellent. Revise history.
56560	61920	Now, what bothers me is people who approach history with a specific modern political agenda,
61920	66080	and oh boy, does Stefan Molyneux have a political agenda.
66560	73200	Now there's plenty of things that are gonna go wrong when you try to apply contemporary political leanings to the ancient world.
73520	77340	You will end up missing things out that contradict your bias,
77720	80640	and overemphasizing certain things that support it.
81120	84320	And you might end up being guilty of what Aldous Huxley would call,
84320	90720	temporal oversimplification, and compressing or stretching the timeline to suit your narrative.
90720	94320	And this is of particular note when we're talking about Roman history.
95040	99680	Ancient Roman civilization existed in so many forms, and for so long,
99680	104800	that there's more than enough evidence to support any sort of modern political leaning.
104800	108160	That is, as long as you're very selective about it.
108560	112560	Rome was, at times, a kingdom, a republic, an empire,
112560	118080	first a city-state that grew to control the Italian peninsula, and then the whole of the Mediterranean.
118800	124240	And it existed for an enormous length of time. It was a republic for about 500 years,
124800	128480	the Western empire fell after another 500 years,
128480	133200	and the eastern half of the empire lasted for another thousand after that.
133200	136640	And actually, something to keep in mind going forward,
136640	140720	is that the entire history of the United States of America,
140720	144080	from the Declaration of Independence to today,
144080	151520	can fit neatly inside just what is considered the decline period of the Western Roman Empire.
151520	156240	Trying to condense this wealth of history and apply it to just the last few decades
156240	162800	of modern politics in the West is, well, difficult to say the least.
162800	166800	And I'm mentioning all this now because Stefan Molyneux, bless him,
166800	168960	does all of this in his video.
168960	174960	He's gonna take his square peg views and try to hammer them into the round hole of Roman history.
175520	177600	For two and a half hours.
177600	180160	But what are Stefan's views, you might be wondering?
180160	186160	Well, for the uninitiated, he's anti-state, anti-taxes, pro-free market,
186960	190960	and in particular, he doesn't much like women, to put it lightly.
191520	197760	And he applies this thinking relentlessly to basically everything, all the time.
197760	201680	And before we get to Rome, actually, I've invented a game called
201680	204240	What Is Stefan Molyneux Talking About?
204800	206240	And I'm gonna show you some clips,
206240	210880	and you have to try and guess the subject of the video that the clip came from.
212160	216080	For men, an attack from the males of another tribe was the greatest evil.
216960	220560	If the men of tribe B attack and conquer tribe A,
220560	224400	the men of tribe A would generally be killed off or enslaved along with their descendants,
224400	227680	thus effectively ending the transmission of their genes.
228480	231840	The women, however, would usually be taken as spoils of war,
231840	234880	which would allow the continuation of their genetics.
235920	241360	Thus, men are conditioned by evolution to guard the tribal perimeters and fight to the death.
241360	244800	That's from his video about Zootopia.
246320	246960	Next clip.
247840	252240	Feminists portray men as evil and patriarchal in order to provoke
252240	257920	the white knight protects the eggs response that actually characterizes historical masculinity,
258560	262720	while single mothers have to pretend that all men are shiftless and irresponsible,
262720	266960	otherwise they themselves will be blamed by their children who are forced to grow up poor
267680	268480	and fatherless.
269040	273680	Almost always the same thing, because their mother chose to mate with a bad man,
273680	277040	or drove away a good man, which is even worse.
277760	283520	And that's from his video about Star Wars The Force Awakens, the last one now.
284960	291120	Young men are worth substantially less in the sexual marketplace than young women,
291920	298000	because young men do not have a lot of resources to provide to pregnant and child-raising women,
298640	303200	while young women have a decade or two of fertility ahead of them.
304640	310560	Young women so often mistake their sexual appeal for personal value,
311280	316080	since it is infinitely easier to giggle and surf the tsunami of male desires
316080	319520	than it is to struggle for a life of virtue and meaning.
320640	324560	And that's from his video about the movie Frozen.
324560	328960	And if you watched Frozen and came away talking about human fertilization
328960	334800	and the sexual marketplace, well, you know, you definitely took a wrong turn somewhere.
335520	339680	Now, I can't tell if Stefan is actually sitting there watching children's movies
339680	341840	and genuinely getting all exasperated,
341840	345760	or if he just views these recent popular movies as good vehicles
345760	348960	for him to get his ideology to a wider audience.
348960	352240	And it's tempting to just talk about Stefan on movies, to be honest,
352240	354640	but we're here for ancient Rome right now.
355200	357760	We'll save the movies for another day.
357760	359200	So let's get to it.
359200	361520	Because this is about saving Western civilization.
361520	365760	We look deep into the past so that we can control the future.
365760	370000	And your past has been so falsified to you, so lied about.
370000	371520	You know, they constantly say,
371520	375440	oh, the only thing that's constant in history is how little people learn from their history.
375440	378080	No, you can absolutely learn from your history.
378080	382080	You can save everything that our ancestors worked so hard to provide to us.
382080	385680	But you must first know the facts about your history.
385680	388160	And when you understand the facts about your history,
388160	392560	which have been so falsified that you live in a matrix of leftist propaganda
392560	394480	rather than any basic empirical facts,
394480	399200	once you understand your history, we can, we might have the possibility,
399200	403360	but this technology, this new Gutenberg press of the internet,
403360	408800	we might have the chance of stopping the 10 generation cycle of empire,
408800	411360	cycle of civilization in its tracks.
411360	414880	We might be able to pile up enough facts, reason, evidence and knowledge
414880	419600	and courage that we can stop the giant grim stone wheel of history
419600	425440	from crushing yet another civilization as it seems poised to do with the West.
425440	428320	Well now, who's ready to stop history?
428320	430800	So we're gonna go through Stefan's video
430800	435040	and examine what he claims are the parallels to the modern Western world.
435840	439120	And as I said, his video is two and a half hours long.
439760	443120	So for sanity's sake, I've decided to cut a lot for time
443120	445520	and just focus on a few specific areas.
445520	447760	Otherwise, we'll be here all day.
447760	452080	But just so you can be sure, I'm not misrepresenting Stefan's arguments here.
452880	456480	I'd encourage you all to go and watch Stefan's video.
457600	458480	Who am I kidding?
459520	461920	Okay, let's move on to our first section.
462480	465680	Now in 58 BC, as we said, Rome began distributing free grain
465680	469680	and this brought huge numbers of the rural poor into Rome.
469680	472320	There was the, again, with ever this mass kind of movement,
472320	473920	there's a push and there's a pull.
473920	476320	The pull was that there was free grain.
476320	479600	The push was the massive influx of slaves from the empire
479600	482480	that the rural poor could not compete with.
483280	489440	Now by the reign of Julius Caesar, 320,000 people were on this welfare dole.
490880	493840	Now the expansion of the dole of the welfare state
493840	496480	drove steep rises in Roman taxes.
497120	499680	And if you're a citizen farmer
499680	501600	and you can't compete with all this slave labor, right?
501600	503840	I mean, then you have a big problem.
503840	507520	You end up leaving your farm, going to the city and living on welfare.
508240	511120	They were a burden on the state and what did they have to do with their time?
511120	512240	Well, not much.
512240	517120	Except cause trouble and contribute to an ever-increasing crime rate.
517120	520560	Huh, now that that's got to be just a coincidence.
520560	526640	And this sort of one-to-one comparison is the standard for the rest of Stefan's video.
526640	530000	The displaced Roman farmers become the modern urban poor,
530560	534480	our western democratic governments become the Roman Empire,
534480	539120	modern immigrants into the west are cast as both the cheap Roman slave labor
539120	542480	and later on the invading barbarian tribes.
543040	548640	So here he's comparing Rome's grain dole to our modern idea of the welfare state
548640	552480	and citing it as one of the reasons that the empire fell.
552480	555360	And now I hate to start this section off with such a minor point,
555360	557360	but see here where Stefan writes,
557440	562320	The conquests of the third and second centuries BC brought so many slaves into the empire.
562320	567520	Well, that doesn't really make sense because the empire didn't exist at that point
568160	572240	and it didn't exist until Augustus a few hundred years later.
572240	578640	What Stefan means to say is slaves were brought into the republic, not the empire.
578640	581920	Now I'm not suggesting Stefan was trying to mislead anyone with this.
581920	584560	He later writes republic in this section even,
584560	587760	so I think saying empire here was just an honest error.
587760	593200	I'm only highlighting it here because it's an indicator of the enormous length of time
593200	595280	that Stefan is compressing.
595280	597280	So, history lesson time.
597280	600560	Before Rome's straight grain dole there was a grain subsidy,
600560	606160	which was one of the reforms brought about under the tribune ships of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus.
606960	611600	And they were two Roman politicians who tried to address the economic inequality
611600	616320	brought about by slavery, forcing all the poorer farmers into unemployment.
616320	620320	And Gaius Gracchus passed a grain law in 123 BC
620320	625360	that set aside a certain amount of state grain to be distributed to the poor at a reduced cost.
625920	630560	And this subsidized grain eventually became free grain in 58 BC,
630560	635520	which was about 500 years before the western empire fell,
635520	640640	and indeed about 30 years before the Roman empire even existed.
640640	644240	So if the grain dole was one of the reasons the empire fell,
644240	647200	it took kind of a long time to kick in.
647200	651360	And I'd like to hear Stefan's solution to this apparent grain dole problem.
651360	652560	Earlier he says,
652560	657600	"...the answers are obvious, but political correctness prevents us from talking about them."
658160	659440	Whatever that means.
659440	664720	Stopping the grain dole would mean food riots and starvation in the capital at best.
664720	669600	It's not like those people could just go and get jobs, you know, slaves had all the jobs.
669600	673680	Really, the grain dole was a sensible state expenditure that, you know,
673680	677680	beyond it being generally quite nice to feed the hungry if you're able to,
677680	682640	it was necessary to prevent the poor from getting their torches and pitchforks out.
682640	686720	But Stefan doesn't like state expenditures in general.
686720	688800	Not even sensible ones.
688800	690240	But it wasn't just the Roman army.
690240	691920	Entire layers of bureaucracy grew.
692480	695840	You know, like how we have national governments in Europe,
695840	698640	and then we have the additional layer of the European Union,
698640	701680	I guess except for the United Kingdom recently.
702400	705120	So originally it was just like Rome, province, city.
705120	706880	Boom. One, two, three, that was it.
706880	712160	By the time of Diocletian, 284 to 305 AD, there were four emperors,
712160	716160	four imperial courts, four Praetorian gods, four palaces, etc.
716160	717440	Kind of a lot of overhead.
718000	720080	So let's talk about Diocletian.
720080	724800	Here, Stefan is presenting the Tetrarchy, which is the common name for the time when
724800	730480	Rome had four emperors as an example of the growth of government bureaucracy.
730480	735120	Now what he fails to mention is why the Tetrarchy was instituted.
735120	739280	And since Diocletian's reforms are generally considered to have prevented
739280	743600	the early collapse of the empire, I think this is worth exploring.
743600	745680	So history lesson time again.
745680	750720	In the third century AD, the Roman Empire went through what has been come to be known as
750720	753200	the Crisis of the Third Century.
753200	758320	Which, as you can probably guess, wasn't a terribly fun time for the Romans.
758320	763840	There were invasions, plague, civil wars, assassinated emperors.
763840	767600	The empire split into three separate empires for a while.
767600	770880	It was... it was like Game of Thrones.
771600	777040	Now the ascension of Diocletian and his following reforms typically mark the end of the crisis.
777040	781520	He basically brought the empire back from the brink of collapse and stabilized it
782160	784960	for a while, at least until he resigned.
784960	787760	And, yes, he resigned.
787760	791760	He was the emperor of Rome, the most powerful man in the world,
791760	794960	and he resigned and went to farm cabbages.
794960	798080	So Diocletian was a pretty interesting guy all around.
798800	800960	As long as you weren't Christian, anyway.
800960	805920	And one of the more interesting reforms was the Tetrarchy, the Rule of Four.
805920	807440	So let's talk about that.
807440	814160	Now the Roman emperors, during the Crisis of the Third Century, had a few relevant problems here.
814160	816960	First was the succession of emperors.
816960	824400	The transfer of power from one to another, quite often his assassin, was usually a very dangerous time.
824400	830560	Next was the size of the empire, which made it extremely difficult for one man to rule by himself.
830560	834560	He couldn't be everywhere at once, and you don't want to get attacked on two fronts
834560	838640	when it can take months for a message from one front to reach the other.
838640	844160	And you don't want to give too many troops and too much power to any one of your generals in particular,
844160	848880	because if they end up winning their battles, they might turn around and march on you,
849440	852160	and kill you, and become the new emperor.
852160	856240	Because, after all, that's probably how you got into power as well.
856240	859760	And another problem here is Rome, the city.
859840	866000	Rome was not, as it turns out, all that well situated, at least in certain circumstances.
866000	870000	You know, an emperor based in Rome is going to take a very long time to reach
870000	874480	and respond to anything of note happening near the borders of his empire.
874480	879840	Now Diocletian's response to these problems was first to appoint a co-emperor,
879840	885520	and later they each appointed a junior emperor, and they divided their territory thusly.
885520	890960	Now the result of this was that the empire was able to fight effectively on multiple fronts,
890960	898240	with multiple leaders in regional capitals who all had the ability to exert power with some level of autonomy.
898240	903280	And there was a more formalized line of succession from junior to senior emperor.
903280	906640	And at least while Diocletian was around, it worked.
906640	910160	And yes, it was a massive increase in state bureaucracy,
910160	914160	but it brought an end to the crisis of the third century.
914160	919600	Now Stefan condenses all this history into one sentence about the growth of government.
919600	924400	And this is really emblematic of his oversimplification of history in general.
924400	926400	In Stefan's history it goes,
926400	930880	No Greindoll, Greindoll instituted, Rome collapses.
930880	934720	One emperor, four emperors, Rome collapses.
934720	939600	And this radical simplification of huge stretches of time is misleading,
939600	945760	but it's necessary in order to make the sorts of comparisons to modern times Stefan is making.
945760	950000	And now at one point Stefan offers a more direct contemporary comparison.
950640	955920	As the parasites overwhelm the host, you have huge problems.
955920	960240	So up to a third, about a third of the people in Rome at certain periods,
960240	963600	were dependent on the state for their survival.
963600	966480	And as Mitt Romney pointed out, I think it was in 2012,
967200	969520	it's pretty hard for Republicans to get elected.
969520	972880	Because close to half of the American population rely
972880	975200	on the state for all or significant portions of their income,
975200	978160	so why would they vote for a shrinkage of the state?
978160	980880	And now there's a lot of things wrong with this comparison.
980880	985200	First of all, Stefan mentions it's difficult for the Republicans to get elected.
985200	989680	And well, it was very difficult indeed for anyone to be elected emperor,
989680	991840	because they didn't have elections.
991840	995760	But let's talk about Mitt Romney's 47% comments.
995760	999120	And for those who haven't seen it, here is that leaked recording.
999520	1002720	There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.
1003840	1007600	There are 47% who are with him who are dependent upon government,
1007600	1009200	who believe that they are victims,
1009200	1012000	who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them,
1012000	1017200	who believe that they're entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.
1017760	1019360	These are people who pay no income tax.
1019360	1022160	47% of Americans pay no income tax.
1022160	1024800	So our message of low taxes doesn't connect.
1025360	1028560	And so my job is not to worry about those people.
1028640	1033040	I'll never think they'd say that they should take first the responsibility and care for the last-
1033040	1034480	Now here's the problem.
1034480	1036800	Mitt Romney was full of shit.
1036800	1042240	He claims that this 47% of people will vote for the president no matter what.
1042240	1048320	But if you look at the actual reasons as to why some of that 47% pay no federal income tax,
1048320	1052000	that claim is quickly exposed as delusional.
1052000	1056560	First off, a large part of that 47% are the elderly,
1056560	1059360	who in one sense do depend on state welfare,
1059360	1064320	but certainly did not exclusively vote for Barack Obama, believe it or not.
1064320	1067680	And aside from the elderly, there's also the working poor who,
1067680	1071920	despite having a job, don't earn enough to pay federal income tax.
1071920	1076000	And there's exemptions for things like households with young children.
1076000	1081200	And notably, the rich don't pay federal income tax because they know how to avoid it.
1081200	1085360	And they're certainly not voting overwhelmingly for Barack Obama either.
1085360	1087440	And let's briefly address Stefan's point,
1087440	1091600	where he says that it's hard to get people to vote for a contraction of the state
1091600	1092880	when they're dependent on it.
1092880	1095920	So we can infer from that that he thinks the Republicans
1095920	1099120	are for contracting the state and reducing spending.
1099680	1102000	And I know they say they're for that,
1102000	1106080	but the most recent Republican president, George W. Bush,
1106080	1110560	oversaw an enormous percentage increase in government spending.
1110560	1112080	Way more than Bill Clinton.
1112640	1115120	Wars aren't cheap, it turns out.
1115120	1117440	And if you're for reducing state spending,
1117440	1121040	then the recent history of the Republican Party should turn you right off.
1121600	1125200	Anyway, let's get back to Rome and move on to our next section.
1125200	1128880	So we're going to start off this section by looking at a quote about women
1128880	1131600	from Stefan's conclusion to his video.
1131600	1133600	And then we'll work backwards from that.
1134480	1135840	Now, here's a quote.
1135840	1137680	I put this out there for discussion.
1137680	1142240	I have not figured out all of my perspectives on this.
1142240	1145440	I put this out for our discussion and we'll put the source to this below.
1146960	1149680	An increase in the influence of women in public life
1149680	1151760	has often been associated with national decline.
1152400	1155520	The later Romans complained that although Rome ruled the world,
1155520	1157120	women ruled Rome.
1157840	1161120	In the 10th century, a similar tendency was observed in the Arab empire.
1161120	1165040	The women demanding admission to the professions hitherto monopolized by men.
1166640	1169760	What, wrote the contemporary historian Ibn Bessan,
1169760	1173680	have the professions of clerk, tax collector or preacher to do with women?
1173680	1176720	These occupations have always been limited to men alone.
1177840	1181440	Many women practiced law while others obtained posts as university professors.
1182000	1184960	There was an agitation for the appointment of female judges,
1184960	1187280	which however does not appear to have succeeded.
1187280	1190640	Soon after this period, government and public order collapsed
1190640	1193200	and foreign invaders overran the country.
1193920	1197120	The resulting increase in confusion and violence made it unsafe for women
1197120	1198640	to move unescorted in the streets
1199360	1202480	with the result that this feminist movement collapsed.
1204480	1206160	I leave you to ponder that one
1206160	1207680	and please let me know what you think in the comments.
1208400	1209360	So there you go.
1209360	1213120	Once women are given power, civilizations collapse.
1213680	1214960	I've heard that one before.
1216000	1217120	But it's okay though.
1217120	1219520	Stefan didn't really say that, of course.
1219520	1221920	He just quoted someone else saying it.
1221920	1224880	He just threw it out there totally randomly,
1225600	1227680	just as a topic for discussion.
1227680	1232240	Now this tactic of sneakily hiding behind his source is especially funny here
1232240	1235280	because until that point Stefan had, in his conclusion,
1235280	1238720	been quoting almost verbatim from that same source,
1239360	1242160	which is Sir John Glubb's The Fate of Empires.
1242160	1243680	And let's take a look.
1243680	1245040	Like out of nowhere, boom!
1245040	1250400	Some small group, kind of ignored beforehand, just explodes and grows and spreads
1250960	1253920	and this is sort of the pioneers as they're bursting out.
1254400	1257520	And rather than virtue and action,
1257520	1262000	there is this interminable engagement in intellectual debate.
1262640	1267200	But these intellectual arguments, they rarely lead to any kind of agreement
1267200	1271280	because, and it's kind of tragic, you know, way back in the day,
1271280	1275920	used to have just a very few number of elite intellectual institutions,
1275920	1278080	you know, Harvard and Cambridge and Oxford and so on.
1278720	1282160	And now it's like every city, every town, every block, it sometimes seems them.
1282880	1286640	So through this process of debate rather than action,
1286640	1291280	there tends to be an intensification of hostilities in the political realm.
1291920	1294640	There is an influx of foreigners, right?
1294640	1297760	Because it's a wealthy region, Rome and Greece and the West,
1297760	1300000	it's wealthy so people want to get in.
1300720	1305600	And so there's an end to sort of cultural or ethnic homogeneity
1306720	1309600	and we can just look at New York and just walk around the streets of New York
1309600	1312240	and see how many descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers are around.
1312240	1317680	The heroes of empires in seemingly terminal decline are always the same.
1317680	1319680	You got your athlete, you got your singer,
1319680	1321760	you got your pretty person, you got your actor.
1322640	1325840	And so if we look at way back in Arab empires in Baghdad,
1325840	1328000	in the golden days of Harum al-Rashid,
1328960	1334640	the Arabs were actually a minority in the capital imperial city of Istanbul.
1335600	1340960	And this is in the great days or in the significant or powerful days of Ottoman rule.
1341520	1344640	Now, did you notice that he fucked that last one up?
1344640	1349120	He accidentally read out two sentences as if they were one sentence.
1349680	1354000	And as a result he created a history Frankenstein's monster
1354000	1357200	where Istanbul is somehow the capital of Baghdad
1357840	1364400	and Harun al-Rashid, who lived in the 700s, is now the leader of the Ottoman Empire somehow.
1364480	1367440	Which didn't even exist for another 500 years.
1367440	1372240	So Stefan is about a thousand miles and five centuries out there.
1372240	1376320	And that's the real problem with just reading things out to support your arguments
1376320	1378480	without really understanding them.
1378480	1383520	So anyway, after basically just straight up reading John Glubb's workout,
1383520	1385840	when he gets to the section on women's rights,
1385840	1387760	Stefan picks that point to be like,
1387760	1391280	oh well, this is just a quote here, I'm quoting someone else.
1391280	1394640	It's just food for thought, not my opinion.
1394640	1399120	You know, he's trying to fly the anti-woman part of the argument under the radar there.
1399680	1403840	So what does Stefan himself actually think about women?
1403840	1406160	And this is taken from his video entitled,
1406720	1409440	The Matriarchal Lineage of Corruption.
1410720	1415920	Women who choose the assholes will fucking end this race.
1416720	1418960	They will fucking end this human race.
1419760	1423280	If we don't start holding them a-fucking-countable.
1424240	1429520	Women who choose assholes guarantee child abuse.
1431520	1440320	Women who choose assholes guarantee criminality, sociopathy, politicians.
1441520	1444560	All the cold-hearted jerks who run the world
1445520	1449680	came out of the vaginas of women who married assholes.
1450880	1453440	And I don't know how to make the world a better place
1453440	1457280	without holding women accountable for choosing assholes.
1458480	1464640	If asshole wasn't a great reproductive strategy, it would have been gone long ago.
1464640	1469280	Women keep that black bastard flame alive.
1469280	1472880	They cup their hands around it, they protect it with their bodies.
1472880	1478800	They keep the evil of the species going by continually choosing these guys.
1480400	1484480	If being an asshole didn't get women, there would be no assholes left.
1485360	1488160	If women chose nice guys over assholes,
1488160	1491920	we would have a glorious and peaceful world in one generation.
1492800	1498480	So women are the root of all evil and will end the human race, apparently.
1498480	1499600	And I have a question,
1499840	1503600	why is everything so cataclysmic with these alt-right people?
1503600	1506320	You know, women won't go out with, quote,
1506320	1511040	nice guys, so the human race is facing annihilation, apparently.
1511040	1514800	Why does every problem have to be an extinction-level event?
1514800	1520160	I saw some guy recently say that Black Lives Matter will end Western civilization.
1520160	1522080	Yeah, Black Lives Matter.
1522080	1525120	You know, we survived the Napoleonic Wars,
1525120	1528640	and the breakup of the empires, and the rise of Nazism,
1528640	1532960	but, you know, some black people who are annoyed about police shooting at them,
1532960	1536400	well, that's game over for Western civilization.
1536400	1538720	Anyway, with regards to Rome,
1538720	1543280	Stefan does think women are somewhat responsible for the fall of the city
1543280	1545840	because they just weren't having enough babies, you see.
1546640	1549040	And there's strong evidence of a steady decline in population
1549680	1552480	across the entire empire from the 2nd century CE on.
1553520	1558080	And by the 500s, there were only 6,000 people left in Rome by.
1558720	1560080	A thousand.
1560080	1566880	And why this fairly drastic reduction in population occurred,
1566880	1568640	well, nobody knows for sure.
1570320	1574560	Though the sort of luxurious lifestyle and the fact that a lot of women became
1574560	1578800	less interested in producing and raising children certainly played some part in that.
1579680	1583600	So then, the depopulation of the city of Rome.
1583600	1586400	Stefan says no one knows for sure why it happened,
1587200	1588000	which isn't true,
1588640	1592800	but that loosening of women's morality played a part.
1592800	1598800	So Stefan quotes the low population of the city of Rome by the time of the 500s.
1598800	1602720	And now, I'd say that, as well as the aforementioned plagues,
1602720	1605520	the sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths,
1605520	1608400	and the sack of Rome in 455 by the Vandals,
1609040	1612000	probably had more to do with the population decline
1612000	1614240	than the lifestyles of the Roman women.
1614320	1617920	But the real truth here is that the importance of the city of Rome
1617920	1621440	had been waning for a very long time before that.
1621440	1625760	Stefan doesn't mention it here, but by the time Rome was sacked by the Visigoths,
1625760	1628960	it wasn't the capital of the Western Empire anymore,
1628960	1632480	and it hadn't been the capital for at least a hundred years.
1632480	1636640	In 286, Diocletian moved the capital from Rome to Milan,
1636640	1638480	and it was later moved to Ravenna,
1638480	1643520	and it's the fall of Ravenna in 476 that is typically marked by historians,
1644000	1646560	as the end of the Western Roman Empire.
1646560	1650320	Stefan really seems to have the blinders on when it comes to women's rights.
1651120	1654560	Let's take a look at another time he quotes a source talking about women.
1655280	1660240	So by the late Republic, a rich wife, who could divorce and take her wealth with her,
1661120	1664000	had a real threat against her husband and could wield influence over him.
1664000	1669200	This increasing female power manifested in escalating sexual promiscuity and adultery.
1669200	1670880	And I guess the modern equivalent would be,
1670880	1673360	I'm going to drag you through the family court system,
1674160	1680960	and that's how I'm going to have power over you, and so I'm going to be more bullying.
1682960	1684400	And one historian wrote,
1684400	1687360	Roman men deplored the fact that these rich women were more concerned
1687360	1690160	with their own figures and luxuries than with their families.
1690160	1694400	Unlike the good old time matrons, according to the historian Tacitus around 100 CE,
1694960	1698800	these modern women did not spend time with their children and did not nurse their infants,
1698800	1700880	but left them to slave wet nurses.
1701840	1705040	Furthermore, children were handed over to be raised by child minders,
1705040	1707920	usually the most useless slaves of the household.
1707920	1710480	Now, I worked in a daycare and there were some nice people there,
1710480	1712880	but a lot of them are kind of like minimum wage people and so on.
1712880	1718960	They would be the least economically productive or valuable people to have raise your children.
1718960	1723920	So that quote there is from Family Values in Ancient Rome by Richard Sala,
1723920	1727760	and it's some excellent selective quoting by Stefan.
1727760	1733520	Now, first of all, all this text on the screen right here came from the article by Richard Sala,
1733520	1736880	so I don't know why Stefan singles out the last section by saying
1736880	1739840	one historian wrote and put in quotation marks around it,
1739840	1744560	because that one historian also wrote all of these sections as well.
1744560	1747520	But whatever Stefan's motivation for doing that,
1747520	1753840	if we read this article by Sala in its entirety, we see what Stefan chose to leave out.
1753840	1758160	And the two sentences preceding Stefan's quotes here read as follows.
1758160	1761920	The Romans had their own evolutionary story about family mores,
1761920	1764480	and it had nothing to do with the invention of affection
1764480	1767280	which they took to be natural and eternal in the family.
1767280	1773600	However, their story did contain elements of the decline of paternal authority and the stable family.
1773600	1776160	Emphasis on the word story there.
1776160	1780240	And then Sala goes on to write everything that Stefan quotes in this video.
1780240	1785840	Now, it's clear that Sala's presenting what Roman authors thought of family values in ancient Rome,
1785840	1788880	not what those family values actually were.
1788880	1793520	And this is made all the more obvious when later Sala goes on to write.
1793520	1796480	What is interesting about these earliest Latin authors
1796480	1800720	is that they are already deploring the moral decline of their own time.
1800720	1805680	In short, the earliest Latin authors were already writing of the breakdown of the good
1805680	1811360	orderly family in which the Pater Familius maintained authority over his wife and children.
1811360	1816800	If there was ever a better age before the decline, it must have been in the prehistoric era.
1816800	1820880	An alternative interpretation, one that I lean towards,
1820880	1825840	is that the golden age before the moral decline never existed in reality,
1825840	1829040	but was a later invention by Roman authors
1829040	1833920	who certainly had no reliable historical evidence for moral trends.
1833920	1837920	That is to say, the narrative of moral decline of the family
1837920	1843760	was based on a historical mirage of a better past, and it was no more than a mirage.
1843760	1845280	So then, a question.
1845280	1849440	What is it with these alt-right guys and not reading their own sources?
1849440	1854560	I'd say about half the time I go and check a source, it says the opposite of what they say it does.
1854560	1859600	And I really can't tell to what degree they're willfully misrepresenting the sources here, you know?
1859600	1862720	I don't know if it's scarier if they know they're lying,
1862720	1864800	or if they think they're telling the truth.
1864800	1869040	It's either incompetence or malice, and I can't tell which.
1869040	1871760	So, thoughts in the comments, please.
1871760	1875280	Now, Stefan does mention at least one form of moral decline
1875280	1877440	that doesn't have anything to do with women.
1878080	1879280	Let's take a look.
1879280	1884720	And Greece, in its own decline, just collapsed or decayed, I guess you could say,
1884720	1887680	into a pretty lawless and disreputable nation.
1887680	1891760	And then they were conquered by the Romans, 146 BC,
1891840	1896240	because they had decayed and had become selfish and had become lazy
1896240	1898560	and become ridiculously self-critical at the same time
1898560	1900880	as there were these ridiculously high levels of hedonism.
1902000	1905680	And they then were conquered from outside.
1905680	1911600	And there's this grim cycle, which we'll talk more in just a moment.
1911600	1916320	It was a very decadent and brutal society, right?
1916320	1919760	The Colosseum would get so soaked with blood
1919760	1922240	during the battles in there, the gladiatorial battles,
1922240	1925920	that they would shovel new sand on the blood hoping to soak it up
1925920	1928640	so it wasn't too unstable for the next round of fighters.
1929200	1935120	383 AD, captive barbarians were being fed to wild animals in the Colosseum.
1935120	1937600	And that is not good.
1938320	1944400	So that's Rome's moral decay as represented by the violence of the Colosseum.
1944400	1946880	And there's two main problems with this picture.
1946880	1951040	The first is that Rome had been doing horrible things to people in arenas
1951040	1954080	for centuries before the dates the fan mentioned.
1954080	1957200	We can look at Suetonius talking about Caligula,
1957200	1963840	who was only the third emperor of Rome, feeding prisoners to wild beasts without a trial.
1963840	1969040	Now Christians, particularly during the times when Christianity was persecuted in the empire,
1969040	1974720	didn't much like the practice of people being fed to animals in arenas, for obvious reasons.
1974720	1977440	And that matters because in the early fourth century,
1977440	1982320	Emperor Constantine came to power and he was the first Christian emperor.
1982320	1987280	And a relevant lore of Constantine's is quoted in the Codex Theodosianus,
1987280	1993040	which was a fifth century compilation of all the edicts and laws issued under Christian emperors.
1993040	1993920	And I quote,
1993920	1998560	Bloody spectacles are not suitable for civil ease and domestic quiet.
1998560	2001520	Wherefore, since we have prescribed gladiators,
2001520	2006080	those who have been accustomed to be sentenced to such work as punishment for their crimes,
2006720	2009360	you should cause the serve in the mines,
2009360	2012560	so that they may be punished without shedding their blood.
2012560	2014400	Constantine Augustus.
2014400	2018560	Now not that this actually put an immediate stop to gladiatorial combat or anything,
2018560	2024960	but the more violent arena events did generally decline under a succession of Christian emperors,
2024960	2030080	coinciding, oddly enough, with the latter days of the Western Empire.
2030080	2032320	And if I were to play devil's advocate here,
2032320	2035760	I could say that these reformers trying to ban gladiator fights
2035760	2040240	were an early example of liberal, PC, social justice types,
2040240	2044400	who were so pathologically altruistic that they were willing to undermine
2044400	2048560	the centuries-old masculine tradition of gladiatorial combat.
2048560	2053200	The decline of the arena shows an erosion of masculine Roman culture
2053200	2055760	right before the fall of the Empire.
2055760	2057280	Blah, blah, blah.
2057280	2060560	And that's the ideologue's approach to history right there.
2060560	2065760	It doesn't matter what actually happened, just spin it to support your position regardless.
2066400	2069280	And one more point on moral decay here.
2069280	2072880	There's a Roman legend of the first generation of Romans
2072880	2075840	called the Kidnapping of the Sabine Women.
2075840	2080640	And as the Romans tell it, the first generation of Romans were mostly men,
2080640	2084400	and they didn't have enough women to establish enough families.
2084400	2087680	So what they did was, they announced a huge festival
2087680	2090960	and invited people from all the nearby towns to attend,
2091520	2095520	and then, at a signal from Romulus, the Romans grabbed all the women,
2095520	2098560	fought off the men, and ran away.
2098560	2101280	And that's a classic comic caper right there,
2101280	2106000	but absolutely horrific if you actually think through any of the particulars.
2106640	2110320	So why am I telling you about the Kidnapping of the Sabine Women?
2110320	2115520	Well, my point here is that the early Romans weren't always moral and virtuous.
2116320	2119360	If morality has one constant throughout history,
2119360	2125520	it's that the preceding generation views the next generation as the worst, most immoral lot yet.
2126240	2128320	But that doesn't make it true.
2128320	2133840	So let's talk about something a little more concrete than concepts of morality and virtue.
2135760	2139280	Now, this is the mind-blowing aspect of it.
2139520	2142880	Just put this into your cogitator and take it for a hamster wheel spin.
2143680	2147840	For all of this peace, all of this amazing public infrastructure,
2147840	2152240	these roads, the astonishing roads that were really the backbone of the army's strength,
2153280	2157280	the legal system, the soldiers, the courts, everything,
2158000	2167840	for all of this, the ordinary Roman citizen worked for only two days a year to pay his taxes.
2167840	2169760	Let me say it again, brothers and sisters!
2169760	2175440	The ordinary Roman citizen worked for only two days a year to pay his taxes.
2175440	2175940	Okay.
2176960	2181600	A little bit more at the end, which we'll get to, but just think of that.
2181600	2182480	Just think of that.
2184000	2190160	So then, the average Roman citizen paid his taxes by working only two days a year.
2190160	2196400	And man, I hunted this source all over the internet, but I found it eventually.
2197040	2198000	I think.
2198000	2204320	An American historian called J. Rufus Fiers put out an audiobook called History of Freedom.
2204320	2209360	And the two days a year thing comes from chapter 9 called Freedom in the Roman Empire.
2209360	2212320	And I think it was from here that Stefan got it,
2212320	2218560	because all of Stefan's other points in this section also come from this chapter of Fiers' audiobook.
2218560	2222160	The Roman Empire of Titus stretched from the
2223360	2227920	Isle of Britain all the way out to the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys of
2228720	2233440	Iraq today, and from the North Sea to the sands of the Sahara.
2234560	2238800	We remember the case of Saint Paul when he is arrested and about to be beaten by a tribune.
2239600	2243120	He says, you cannot beat me, it is against my rights as a Roman citizen.
2243120	2245520	And the tribune says, I don't believe you.
2245520	2246800	Paul pulls out his papers.
2247520	2249040	How did you get to be a Roman citizen?
2249040	2250400	I had to pay a bribe to get one.
2250960	2255840	Because for this wealth and prosperity, this protection by a superb army,
2256480	2266560	for this infrastructure of roads, the ordinary Roman works two days a year to pay his taxes.
2267120	2270560	Now J. Rufus Fiers declines to show his workings here,
2270560	2274720	so I can't actually be sure how he arrived at two days a year.
2274720	2279840	And from listening to his audiobook, Fiers also has a very clear modern political bias,
2279840	2284160	so I wouldn't be surprised if he was fudging the numbers a little bit, to be honest.
2284160	2285760	But I don't know.
2285760	2289520	Now, there is a book in the reading list that came with the audiobook
2289520	2292400	that contains the two days worth of tax thing.
2292400	2293520	And that's entitled,
2294080	2297760	Preparing America's Foreign Policy for the 21st Century.
2297760	2303840	And that's a collection of talks and discussions held at the University of Oklahoma in 1999
2303840	2307440	by a bunch of professors and foreign policy experts.
2307440	2310400	And the two days quote is in a section called
2310400	2313440	The Roman Experience Commentary and Discussion.
2313440	2317760	And that chapter is authored by J. Rufus Fiers.
2317760	2322320	Now, if this book's intended as a source, then that's quite funny, to be honest.
2322320	2325280	I like the audacity of just quoting yourself.
2325280	2327280	But it might not be meant to be a source.
2327920	2328720	I don't know.
2328720	2333280	It might just be an instance of the professor putting his own book on the reading list, you know.
2333840	2336160	Anyway, just for the sake of this argument,
2336160	2340320	I'm gonna assume that the two days a year thing is true.
2340320	2341040	So, okay.
2341040	2345200	The average Roman citizen pays his taxes in just two days of work.
2345200	2347360	Well, the first thing to note here is the phrase
2347360	2352160	average citizen is not the same as average inhabitant.
2352160	2356080	The Roman understanding of the word citizen is not the same as ours.
2356080	2359040	Not everyone in the empire was a citizen.
2359040	2365040	Rome was a slave state, for starters, and slaves were considered property, not citizens.
2365040	2369680	Actually, before the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD,
2369680	2376960	pretty much only three Roman men born on the Italian peninsula were considered full citizens.
2376960	2381520	Inhabitants of the other provinces of the empire were not full citizens.
2381520	2387280	And this is significant because Italy itself was largely exempt from taxation
2387280	2391440	until Diocletian's tax reforms in 290 AD.
2391440	2398080	So to be a full Roman citizen before both the Edict of Caracalla and Diocletian's reforms
2398080	2401840	means that you're not likely to be paying taxes anyway.
2401840	2406240	And so we have to ask, what period of time is Stefan talking about?
2406240	2409280	Stefan says taxes were paid in two days of work
2409280	2412640	except for an increase near the end of the empire,
2412640	2415840	and wouldn't that be narratively convenient?
2415840	2418880	Well, the section of Fier's audiobook the quote comes from
2418880	2423200	is talking about an average day in the life of a citizen of Pompeii.
2423200	2429200	And Pompeii was destroyed in 79 AD, so we're necessarily talking earlier than that.
2429840	2434480	Relatively early empire, and long before the Edict of Caracalla.
2434480	2439840	Meaning most full Roman citizens at this point were exempt from most taxes,
2439840	2443280	so it's not surprising they were quite low, to be honest.
2443280	2447200	And I'm very interested if Stefan thinks this system would work today.
2447920	2452160	Imagine President Trump comes to office and he says,
2452160	2457760	okay everyone, all American citizens are now exempt from taxation.
2459280	2465360	Except from now on only white men who were born here count as citizens.
2466160	2468400	And also we're bringing slavery back.
2469120	2472400	And by the way, I've just declared war on Canada
2472400	2476960	so that we can go and steal all of their things and get more slaves.
2477520	2480640	I imagine there'd be somewhat of a mixed reaction.
2480640	2484720	Also, I'm reminded of Stefan talking about the Grain Doll.
2484720	2490800	Now the expansion of the doll of the welfare state drove steep rises in Roman taxes.
2490800	2494160	But how does this work in Stefan's world?
2494160	2497920	I mean, the Grain Doll was brought in before Pompeii was destroyed,
2498560	2500800	and it didn't go away or anything.
2500800	2503840	The Grain Doll was around throughout this whole period, so...
2504400	2508320	Stefan at one point makes it seem like the citizens of Rome were struggling
2508320	2513040	under the heavy tax burden of paying for the welfare of all the lazy scroungers,
2513040	2517920	while at another point making it seem like the Romans were paying almost no taxes
2517920	2520640	and enjoying economic freedom and growth.
2520640	2523280	You know, which is it? It can't be both.
2523280	2527680	And I'd like now to consider one point in Stefan's video where he either ignores
2527680	2531360	or just fails to mention a contradiction in his argument,
2531360	2533680	even when it's staring him right in the face.
2534480	2539680	Octavian took the name Augustus and became the first emperor of Rome,
2539680	2542080	ruling from 27 BC to 14 AD.
2542800	2546320	Now this did shrink some political freedom, you know, he's an emperor,
2547040	2550240	but it did lead to an expansion of economic freedom.
2550240	2555360	So Augustus did favour private enterprise, private property, and free trade.
2555440	2559040	So that's good, for merchants at least,
2559040	2561520	and for the general population who care more about bread than votes.
2562800	2565600	So under Augustus, taxes were lowered significantly.
2565600	2569040	He abolished tax farming, which was this practice of just saying to people
2569040	2572560	go get me a bunch of taxes and if you can't get them you have to pay me anyway.
2573440	2576160	And he regulated taxation as a whole.
2576160	2580720	So Trump-ish could be made the case.
2581280	2586640	So Stefan says that Augustus favoured private enterprise and free trade.
2586640	2590560	But then he immediately gives an example of Augustus doing something
2590560	2594560	which could very much be seen as the opposite of those things.
2594560	2600480	So tax farming was the way that Rome collected taxes until Augustus's reforms.
2600480	2605280	And what would happen is the state would auction off the rights to tax particular areas
2605280	2609040	to private individuals, and then that private individual
2609040	2611680	would be responsible for taxing the area.
2611680	2617360	And as you might imagine, it tended to be abused by people looking to maximise profit.
2617360	2621840	And Augustus abolished this practice and regulated the tax system,
2621840	2626240	which resulted, as Stefan points out, in lower taxes.
2626240	2631760	So could one not argue that this is an example of the state interfering with
2631760	2634960	and imposing restrictions on the free market?
2635280	2638800	Augustus abolished the right to trade tax farming rights
2638800	2642160	and brought tax under the regulation of the state.
2642160	2647600	So couldn't it be said that it was the free market that led to the unfairly high taxes
2647600	2650240	and the state bureaucracy that lowered them?
2650240	2653440	A point of comparison here is Augustus's creation
2653440	2656960	of an institutionalised police force and fire brigade.
2656960	2660960	Before Augustus, Rome's fire brigades were owned privately
2660960	2664960	and this is a bust of Marcus Licinius Crassus,
2664960	2667840	which is a hell of a name to say if you have a lisp, by the way,
2668560	2671920	who was the owner of such a privatised fire brigade
2671920	2676960	and not so coincidentally one of the richest men in human history.
2676960	2681440	You see, when there was a fire in Rome, Crassus would have his fire brigade turn up
2681440	2686560	and then do nothing while Crassus argued prices with the owner of the burning property.
2686560	2689360	And if they didn't agree to pay Crassus what he wanted,
2689360	2692480	he'd just leave and take his fire brigade with him.
2692480	2697360	And that's obviously not a very reliable or safe system of firefighting.
2697360	2700960	And so Augustus instituted a public fire brigade
2700960	2705920	and he actually levied a new tax on the sale of slaves in order to set it up.
2705920	2712240	What a tax and spend anti-free market socialist, one might say.
2712240	2715600	Also, while we're looking at this section of Stefan's video,
2715600	2718560	let's just, for a laugh, check out this source here.
2719360	2721920	The historian Oertle wrote in 1934,
2721920	2726160	quote, the victory of Augustus and of the West meant a repulse
2726160	2729840	of the tendencies towards state capitalism and state socialism
2730480	2736080	which might have come to fruition had Anthony and Cleopatra been victorious.
2736080	2739920	So in that war, if the central planning of Egypt had spread to Rome
2739920	2742800	it would have been a disaster and it didn't spread the other way
2742800	2748400	because Egypt was like the basket case for the Roman crane.
2748400	2754080	So first off, as we know by now, the importation of post-industrial revolution ideas
2754080	2759600	like socialism and capitalism into the ancient world is misleading and annoying.
2759600	2762480	But let's check out this Oertle guy.
2762480	2766640	So Stefan is quoting here from a Cato Institute article called
2766640	2770000	How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome.
2770000	2775520	And a more cynical man than me might suspect that an article by a libertarian think tank
2775520	2781040	talking about the evils of excessive government might just be a tiny bit biased.
2781040	2788000	But far-fetched speculation aside, the article includes two sources for its quotes by Oertle
2788000	2792640	and that's chapter 10 and chapter 12 of the Cambridge Ancient History
2792640	2796160	published in 1934 and 1939.
2796160	2799600	And when I saw that I thought, oh, that's quite a long time ago.
2799600	2803840	I wonder if there are any more recent editions of those books
2803920	2806880	and would you believe it, yes there are.
2806880	2812240	But I just want to detour a little before we get to those and mention Michael Rostovzef
2813440	2814880	better said that wrong
2814880	2819840	who is another historian quoted by both the Cato Institute and Stefan.
2819840	2824640	And he's someone else who compared his contemporary political situation to ancient Rome
2824640	2828240	and funnily enough whose Wikipedia article says
2828240	2833760	Rostovzef used terms such as proletariat, bourgeoisie and capitalism freely in his work
2833760	2837520	and the importation of those terms into a description of the ancient world
2837520	2841360	where they did not necessarily apply caused criticism.
2841360	2843360	So then, do you have those two names?
2843920	2849280	Right, so let's look at the updated version of Cambridge Ancient History.
2849280	2855840	And firstly, the newer edition of volume 10 published in 1996 says
2855840	2858960	It is probably true that there is no period in Roman history
2858960	2864320	on which the views of modern scholars have been more radically transformed in the last six decades.
2864320	2869840	It's therefore appropriate to indicate briefly in what respects this volume differs most significantly,
2870480	2871200	etc.
2871760	2875280	You get the point, the volume has been heavily revised.
2875280	2879200	And it goes on to outline the reasons for the changes in perspective
2879200	2881040	and then the revisions themselves.
2881680	2886960	And one of these revisions was to just drop Oertl's contribution entirely,
2886960	2892160	saying basically that it was interesting in its day but it no longer holds up.
2892160	2894880	Now then, the new edition of volume 12.
2894880	2899760	And this volume is openly critical of both Rostovzef and Oertl's tactic
2899760	2903200	of comparing contemporary politics to the ancient world.
2903200	2908320	And here's a quote taken from the introduction to the section where it first mentions Oertl.
2908320	2911760	In a rather loose way, modern bourgeois ideology-
2911760	2912800	Bourgeois?
2912800	2914720	Bourgeois, I can never say that.
2914720	2920480	ideology has thought it possible to identify the present-day bourgeoisie with the curiales
2920480	2926400	and has taken up their cause against the despotism of a totalitarian imperial state.
2926400	2931840	This is a singularly anachronistic projection of contemporary realities.
2931840	2933440	So what's my point here?
2933440	2939600	Well, the Cato Institute and by proxy Stefan are selectively quoting older editions
2939600	2943600	of the Cambridge ancient history from the 1930s
2943600	2948400	and ignoring the more recent editions that take a contrary and critical view
2948400	2950240	of those earlier editions.
2950240	2953440	But hey, I guess if you want to stop the wheel of history,
2953440	2956320	you also have to stop historical research.
2956880	2960800	Let's look at one of the times that Rostovzef shows up in Stefan's video.
2960800	2965280	And I'm going to show you two clips now, both concerning historian Edward Gibbon.
2967440	2971760	Gibbon, one of the famous historians who really knew the history of Rome and, you know,
2971760	2976800	turned his hands into arthritic claws writing all this stuff out.
2976800	2980880	He wrote once, he said that if a person were to pick the one period
2980880	2985280	in the history of the human race when mankind was happiest, he would, without hesitation,
2986160	2991360	choose that period of the second century AD when Rome was stable, when peace reigned
2991360	2993280	and trade reigned throughout the empire.
2993280	2996080	Trade was constantly rising and falling as empires rose and fall.
2996800	3001280	And that is really, really astonishing to think about.
3001280	3005600	Michael Rostovzef has described this as a period of quote,
3005600	3011520	almost complete freedom for trade and of splendid opportunities for private initiative.
3011520	3014800	And this is one of the reasons why, earlier Gibbon said,
3014800	3017680	this was some of the best places to live ever.
3018320	3021120	Two days a year, pay your taxes, five percent on customs duties,
3021120	3022400	which means locally produced goods.
3022400	3024800	There's no tax, no duties, no nothing at all.
3025440	3026960	And it's just astounding.
3026960	3030880	So firstly, this quote of Rostovzef is specifically talking about
3030880	3034000	the reign of Augustus and his immediate successors.
3034560	3039760	The time Gibbon identified as the best time to live was under the reign of the so-called
3039760	3043440	Five Good Emperors, which was a century later.
3043440	3046000	So let's read Gibbon's actual quote.
3046000	3049760	If a man were called to fix the period in the history of the world
3049760	3054480	during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous,
3054480	3056640	he would, without hesitation,
3056640	3061440	name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus.
3061440	3066160	The vast extent of the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power
3066160	3069360	under the guidance of virtue and wisdom.
3069360	3074560	And he goes on to mention the civil administration and the laws and the relative peace.
3074560	3080240	Nowhere here does Gibbon say anything about free trade or the economy or anything.
3080240	3085040	But he does mention the absolute power wielded by the state as a positive,
3085600	3089680	which I wouldn't think Stefan would be too keen on, to be perfectly honest.
3089680	3093760	So I'd like to wrap up my video by responding to a few key moments
3093760	3096080	from Stefan's conclusion to his video.
3097040	3099600	And the last thing that I want to say is that
3101600	3102320	people complain.
3102320	3103280	I mentioned this at the beginning.
3103280	3104000	People complain.
3104000	3106160	They say, well, nobody learns anything from history.
3106160	3108800	Well, it's like because nobody tells the truth about history.
3108800	3114080	So what has happened is the history of the West in particular,
3115440	3118160	the glories, the triumphs and the disasters,
3118160	3121280	the full span of the Shakespearean span of Western history
3121280	3125040	has been replaced by vituperative calumny and nagging.
3125040	3126480	Your ancestors were bad.
3126480	3127680	Your ancestors were mean.
3127680	3128320	They were sexist.
3128320	3129040	They were patriarchs.
3129040	3129600	They were racist.
3129600	3130320	They were homophobes.
3130320	3131840	They were bad, bad, bad.
3131840	3134080	Colonialism was just terrible, terrible, terrible.
3134080	3135920	They slaughtered all the natives and all, right?
3137040	3142800	The truth is that the West has bought by far the greatest values to the world.
3142800	3145600	The values of science, the values of reason, the values of the free market,
3145600	3147680	the values of modern medicine, the values of capitalism.
3147680	3155680	You are the offspring and the descendants of many heroes,
3156560	3162160	of many brave souls who fought very hard to bring and extend the freedoms you now enjoy.
3164320	3168480	If you feel that you are descended from evil,
3169840	3172960	you have nothing in your civilization to defend.
3172960	3186080	You are children of heroes and only heroes get to keep their freedoms.
3186080	3188160	Oh, Stefan.
3190560	3195360	So included there is Stefan saying that nobody tells the truth about history,
3195360	3199520	but what is the truth about history according to him?
3199520	3205520	Truth for Molyneux appears to be whatever historical facts conform to his narrative,
3205520	3208400	and everything else is just, to quote him,
3208400	3212160	interminable engagement in intellectual debate.
3212160	3216640	Stefan also says that unless you think you're descended from heroes,
3216640	3220320	you have nothing to defend about your civilization.
3220320	3221600	And that's just not true.
3221600	3224320	I don't think I'm descended from heroes,
3224320	3228320	and I'll fully admit all the horrible things my society's done in the past,
3228320	3231520	but I'm still proud of things about my society.
3231520	3233520	You know, specifically here,
3233520	3238800	that I have the freedom to admit that my society's done those awful things.
3238800	3243600	The things I want to defend about my society are all the things that Stefan Molyneux
3243600	3246080	would take away if he had the chance.
3246080	3251920	You know, the fall of western civilization for me would be the reinstitution of slavery,
3251920	3255600	the taken away of women's rights, and things like that.
3255600	3258320	I don't like this ultra-nationalist idea
3258320	3262960	where you have to ignore all the bad things your culture or race has ever done.
3262960	3267440	You know, what does Stefan think happened to the Native American societies?
3268240	3272000	I don't know, I guess their taxes must have been too high or something.
3272960	3273840	Oh, god.
3274480	3276640	No, I'm not doing it.
3276640	3277840	I'm not watching it.
3277840	3282560	I'm all Molyneuxed out for a good six months, at least.
3282560	3285360	If you enjoyed this interminable intellectual debate,
3285920	3287040	please like and subscribe.
3287600	3289280	I know what they do now, I think.
3290160	3293680	I've also got a donation link on the YouTube banner there,
3293680	3295920	if you're feeling particularly generous,
3295920	3299360	and I've had quite a few donations of some very lovely people
3299360	3301120	whose names I won't read out,
3301120	3303600	because I don't know if they want me to, to be honest.
3303600	3307360	But you know who you are, and you are very much appreciated.
3307360	3310880	Also, if you'd like me to take a look at any specific video,
3310880	3313600	hit me up on either Twitter or Ask FM,
3313600	3316400	and there will be links to those in the description.
3316400	3319520	And look at me doing the proper YouTuber ending to the video,
3319520	3322000	rather than just cutting away mid-sentence.
3322000	3324400	I'm learning.
3324400	3326960	Next, I have to figure out motion graphics.
