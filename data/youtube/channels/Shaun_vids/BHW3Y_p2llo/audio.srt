00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Hello there. This is a video about Stefan Molyneux, and in particular his video The Truth About the Fall of Rome

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:16,400
Modern Parallels. Now his video is two and a half hours long, but I decided to take a look at it anyway, for two main reasons.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,080
Firstly, I love talking about Rome.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,320
I'm a big Roman history fan, and secondly, a particular pet peeve of mine is people

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,760
cherry-picking from Roman history, and ancient history in general, to support some modern ideology.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,100
Not that I'm suggesting we should ignore history, or that there are no specific

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,120
parallels between the ancient world and the modern, because I think there are plenty of legitimate points of comparison.

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,540
Nor do I have any problem in particular with historical revisionism, if it's done for the right reasons.

9
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,920
If you find new evidence to support or disprove some facets of current historical knowledge,

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
excellent. Revise history.

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,920
Now, what bothers me is people who approach history with a specific modern political agenda,

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,080
and oh boy, does Stefan Molyneux have a political agenda.

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,200
Now there's plenty of things that are gonna go wrong when you try to apply contemporary political leanings to the ancient world.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,340
You will end up missing things out that contradict your bias,

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,640
and overemphasizing certain things that support it.

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,320
And you might end up being guilty of what Aldous Huxley would call,

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,720
temporal oversimplification, and compressing or stretching the timeline to suit your narrative.

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,320
And this is of particular note when we're talking about Roman history.

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,680
Ancient Roman civilization existed in so many forms, and for so long,

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,800
that there's more than enough evidence to support any sort of modern political leaning.

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,160
That is, as long as you're very selective about it.

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Rome was, at times, a kingdom, a republic, an empire,

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,080
first a city-state that grew to control the Italian peninsula, and then the whole of the Mediterranean.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,240
And it existed for an enormous length of time. It was a republic for about 500 years,

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,480
the Western empire fell after another 500 years,

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,200
and the eastern half of the empire lasted for another thousand after that.

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,640
And actually, something to keep in mind going forward,

28
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,720
is that the entire history of the United States of America,

29
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,080
from the Declaration of Independence to today,

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,520
can fit neatly inside just what is considered the decline period of the Western Roman Empire.

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,240
Trying to condense this wealth of history and apply it to just the last few decades

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,800
of modern politics in the West is, well, difficult to say the least.

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
And I'm mentioning all this now because Stefan Molyneux, bless him,

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,960
does all of this in his video.

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,960
He's gonna take his square peg views and try to hammer them into the round hole of Roman history.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,600
For two and a half hours.

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,160
But what are Stefan's views, you might be wondering?

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,160
Well, for the uninitiated, he's anti-state, anti-taxes, pro-free market,

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,960
and in particular, he doesn't much like women, to put it lightly.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,760
And he applies this thinking relentlessly to basically everything, all the time.

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
And before we get to Rome, actually, I've invented a game called

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,240
What Is Stefan Molyneux Talking About?

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
And I'm gonna show you some clips,

44
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,880
and you have to try and guess the subject of the video that the clip came from.

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,080
For men, an attack from the males of another tribe was the greatest evil.

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,560
If the men of tribe B attack and conquer tribe A,

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
the men of tribe A would generally be killed off or enslaved along with their descendants,

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
thus effectively ending the transmission of their genes.

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,840
The women, however, would usually be taken as spoils of war,

50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,880
which would allow the continuation of their genetics.

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,360
Thus, men are conditioned by evolution to guard the tribal perimeters and fight to the death.

52
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,800
That's from his video about Zootopia.

53
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Next clip.

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,240
Feminists portray men as evil and patriarchal in order to provoke

55
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,920
the white knight protects the eggs response that actually characterizes historical masculinity,

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,720
while single mothers have to pretend that all men are shiftless and irresponsible,

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,960
otherwise they themselves will be blamed by their children who are forced to grow up poor

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
and fatherless.

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,680
Almost always the same thing, because their mother chose to mate with a bad man,

60
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,040
or drove away a good man, which is even worse.

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,520
And that's from his video about Star Wars The Force Awakens, the last one now.

62
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,120
Young men are worth substantially less in the sexual marketplace than young women,

63
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,000
because young men do not have a lot of resources to provide to pregnant and child-raising women,

64
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,200
while young women have a decade or two of fertility ahead of them.

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,560
Young women so often mistake their sexual appeal for personal value,

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,080
since it is infinitely easier to giggle and surf the tsunami of male desires

67
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,520
than it is to struggle for a life of virtue and meaning.

68
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,560
And that's from his video about the movie Frozen.

69
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,960
And if you watched Frozen and came away talking about human fertilization

70
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,800
and the sexual marketplace, well, you know, you definitely took a wrong turn somewhere.

71
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,680
Now, I can't tell if Stefan is actually sitting there watching children's movies

72
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
and genuinely getting all exasperated,

73
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,760
or if he just views these recent popular movies as good vehicles

74
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,960
for him to get his ideology to a wider audience.

75
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,240
And it's tempting to just talk about Stefan on movies, to be honest,

76
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,640
but we're here for ancient Rome right now.

77
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,760
We'll save the movies for another day.

78
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
So let's get to it.

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,520
Because this is about saving Western civilization.

80
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,760
We look deep into the past so that we can control the future.

81
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,000
And your past has been so falsified to you, so lied about.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,520
You know, they constantly say,

83
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,440
oh, the only thing that's constant in history is how little people learn from their history.

84
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,080
No, you can absolutely learn from your history.

85
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,080
You can save everything that our ancestors worked so hard to provide to us.

86
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
But you must first know the facts about your history.

87
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160
And when you understand the facts about your history,

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,560
which have been so falsified that you live in a matrix of leftist propaganda

89
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,480
rather than any basic empirical facts,

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,200
once you understand your history, we can, we might have the possibility,

91
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,360
but this technology, this new Gutenberg press of the internet,

92
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,800
we might have the chance of stopping the 10 generation cycle of empire,

93
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,360
cycle of civilization in its tracks.

94
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
We might be able to pile up enough facts, reason, evidence and knowledge

95
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,600
and courage that we can stop the giant grim stone wheel of history

96
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,440
from crushing yet another civilization as it seems poised to do with the West.

97
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,320
Well now, who's ready to stop history?

98
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,800
So we're gonna go through Stefan's video

99
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,040
and examine what he claims are the parallels to the modern Western world.

100
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,120
And as I said, his video is two and a half hours long.

101
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,120
So for sanity's sake, I've decided to cut a lot for time

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
and just focus on a few specific areas.

103
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,760
Otherwise, we'll be here all day.

104
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,080
But just so you can be sure, I'm not misrepresenting Stefan's arguments here.

105
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,480
I'd encourage you all to go and watch Stefan's video.

106
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,480
Who am I kidding?

107
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,920
Okay, let's move on to our first section.

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,680
Now in 58 BC, as we said, Rome began distributing free grain

109
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,680
and this brought huge numbers of the rural poor into Rome.

110
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,320
There was the, again, with ever this mass kind of movement,

111
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,920
there's a push and there's a pull.

112
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,320
The pull was that there was free grain.

113
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,600
The push was the massive influx of slaves from the empire

114
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,480
that the rural poor could not compete with.

115
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,440
Now by the reign of Julius Caesar, 320,000 people were on this welfare dole.

116
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,840
Now the expansion of the dole of the welfare state

117
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,480
drove steep rises in Roman taxes.

118
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
And if you're a citizen farmer

119
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
and you can't compete with all this slave labor, right?

120
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,840
I mean, then you have a big problem.

121
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,520
You end up leaving your farm, going to the city and living on welfare.

122
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
They were a burden on the state and what did they have to do with their time?

123
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,240
Well, not much.

124
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,120
Except cause trouble and contribute to an ever-increasing crime rate.

125
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,560
Huh, now that that's got to be just a coincidence.

126
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,640
And this sort of one-to-one comparison is the standard for the rest of Stefan's video.

127
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,000
The displaced Roman farmers become the modern urban poor,

128
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,480
our western democratic governments become the Roman Empire,

129
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,120
modern immigrants into the west are cast as both the cheap Roman slave labor

130
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
and later on the invading barbarian tribes.

131
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,640
So here he's comparing Rome's grain dole to our modern idea of the welfare state

132
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,480
and citing it as one of the reasons that the empire fell.

133
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
And now I hate to start this section off with such a minor point,

134
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
but see here where Stefan writes,

135
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,320
The conquests of the third and second centuries BC brought so many slaves into the empire.

136
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,520
Well, that doesn't really make sense because the empire didn't exist at that point

137
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,240
and it didn't exist until Augustus a few hundred years later.

138
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,640
What Stefan means to say is slaves were brought into the republic, not the empire.

139
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,920
Now I'm not suggesting Stefan was trying to mislead anyone with this.

140
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,560
He later writes republic in this section even,

141
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
so I think saying empire here was just an honest error.

142
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,200
I'm only highlighting it here because it's an indicator of the enormous length of time

143
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,280
that Stefan is compressing.

144
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
So, history lesson time.

145
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,560
Before Rome's straight grain dole there was a grain subsidy,

146
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,160
which was one of the reforms brought about under the tribune ships of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus.

147
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,600
And they were two Roman politicians who tried to address the economic inequality

148
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,320
brought about by slavery, forcing all the poorer farmers into unemployment.

149
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,320
And Gaius Gracchus passed a grain law in 123 BC

150
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,360
that set aside a certain amount of state grain to be distributed to the poor at a reduced cost.

151
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,560
And this subsidized grain eventually became free grain in 58 BC,

152
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,520
which was about 500 years before the western empire fell,

153
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,640
and indeed about 30 years before the Roman empire even existed.

154
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,240
So if the grain dole was one of the reasons the empire fell,

155
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
it took kind of a long time to kick in.

156
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,360
And I'd like to hear Stefan's solution to this apparent grain dole problem.

157
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,560
Earlier he says,

158
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,600
"...the answers are obvious, but political correctness prevents us from talking about them."

159
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
Whatever that means.

160
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,720
Stopping the grain dole would mean food riots and starvation in the capital at best.

161
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,600
It's not like those people could just go and get jobs, you know, slaves had all the jobs.

162
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,680
Really, the grain dole was a sensible state expenditure that, you know,

163
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
beyond it being generally quite nice to feed the hungry if you're able to,

164
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,640
it was necessary to prevent the poor from getting their torches and pitchforks out.

165
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,720
But Stefan doesn't like state expenditures in general.

166
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,800
Not even sensible ones.

167
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,240
But it wasn't just the Roman army.

168
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,920
Entire layers of bureaucracy grew.

169
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,840
You know, like how we have national governments in Europe,

170
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,640
and then we have the additional layer of the European Union,

171
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,680
I guess except for the United Kingdom recently.

172
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,120
So originally it was just like Rome, province, city.

173
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,880
Boom. One, two, three, that was it.

174
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,160
By the time of Diocletian, 284 to 305 AD, there were four emperors,

175
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160
four imperial courts, four Praetorian gods, four palaces, etc.

176
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,440
Kind of a lot of overhead.

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,080
So let's talk about Diocletian.

178
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,800
Here, Stefan is presenting the Tetrarchy, which is the common name for the time when

179
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,480
Rome had four emperors as an example of the growth of government bureaucracy.

180
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,120
Now what he fails to mention is why the Tetrarchy was instituted.

181
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,280
And since Diocletian's reforms are generally considered to have prevented

182
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,600
the early collapse of the empire, I think this is worth exploring.

183
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
So history lesson time again.

184
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,720
In the third century AD, the Roman Empire went through what has been come to be known as

185
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,200
the Crisis of the Third Century.

186
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,320
Which, as you can probably guess, wasn't a terribly fun time for the Romans.

187
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,840
There were invasions, plague, civil wars, assassinated emperors.

188
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,600
The empire split into three separate empires for a while.

189
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
It was... it was like Game of Thrones.

190
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,040
Now the ascension of Diocletian and his following reforms typically mark the end of the crisis.

191
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,520
He basically brought the empire back from the brink of collapse and stabilized it

192
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,960
for a while, at least until he resigned.

193
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,760
And, yes, he resigned.

194
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,760
He was the emperor of Rome, the most powerful man in the world,

195
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,960
and he resigned and went to farm cabbages.

196
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,080
So Diocletian was a pretty interesting guy all around.

197
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,960
As long as you weren't Christian, anyway.

198
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,920
And one of the more interesting reforms was the Tetrarchy, the Rule of Four.

199
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
So let's talk about that.

200
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,160
Now the Roman emperors, during the Crisis of the Third Century, had a few relevant problems here.

201
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,960
First was the succession of emperors.

202
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,400
The transfer of power from one to another, quite often his assassin, was usually a very dangerous time.

203
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:50,560
Next was the size of the empire, which made it extremely difficult for one man to rule by himself.

204
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,560
He couldn't be everywhere at once, and you don't want to get attacked on two fronts

205
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,640
when it can take months for a message from one front to reach the other.

206
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,160
And you don't want to give too many troops and too much power to any one of your generals in particular,

207
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,880
because if they end up winning their battles, they might turn around and march on you,

208
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
and kill you, and become the new emperor.

209
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,240
Because, after all, that's probably how you got into power as well.

210
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,760
And another problem here is Rome, the city.

211
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,000
Rome was not, as it turns out, all that well situated, at least in certain circumstances.

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You know, an emperor based in Rome is going to take a very long time to reach

213
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,480
and respond to anything of note happening near the borders of his empire.

214
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,840
Now Diocletian's response to these problems was first to appoint a co-emperor,

215
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,520
and later they each appointed a junior emperor, and they divided their territory thusly.

216
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,960
Now the result of this was that the empire was able to fight effectively on multiple fronts,

217
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:58,240
with multiple leaders in regional capitals who all had the ability to exert power with some level of autonomy.

218
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,280
And there was a more formalized line of succession from junior to senior emperor.

219
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,640
And at least while Diocletian was around, it worked.

220
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,160
And yes, it was a massive increase in state bureaucracy,

221
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,160
but it brought an end to the crisis of the third century.

222
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,600
Now Stefan condenses all this history into one sentence about the growth of government.

223
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,400
And this is really emblematic of his oversimplification of history in general.

224
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
In Stefan's history it goes,

225
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,880
No Greindoll, Greindoll instituted, Rome collapses.

226
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,720
One emperor, four emperors, Rome collapses.

227
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,600
And this radical simplification of huge stretches of time is misleading,

228
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,760
but it's necessary in order to make the sorts of comparisons to modern times Stefan is making.

229
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,000
And now at one point Stefan offers a more direct contemporary comparison.

230
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,920
As the parasites overwhelm the host, you have huge problems.

231
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,240
So up to a third, about a third of the people in Rome at certain periods,

232
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,600
were dependent on the state for their survival.

233
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
And as Mitt Romney pointed out, I think it was in 2012,

234
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,520
it's pretty hard for Republicans to get elected.

235
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,880
Because close to half of the American population rely

236
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,200
on the state for all or significant portions of their income,

237
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,160
so why would they vote for a shrinkage of the state?

238
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,880
And now there's a lot of things wrong with this comparison.

239
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,200
First of all, Stefan mentions it's difficult for the Republicans to get elected.

240
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,680
And well, it was very difficult indeed for anyone to be elected emperor,

241
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,840
because they didn't have elections.

242
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,760
But let's talk about Mitt Romney's 47% comments.

243
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,120
And for those who haven't seen it, here is that leaked recording.

244
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,720
There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.

245
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,600
There are 47% who are with him who are dependent upon government,

246
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,200
who believe that they are victims,

247
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,000
who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them,

248
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,200
who believe that they're entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.

249
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,360
These are people who pay no income tax.

250
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,160
47% of Americans pay no income tax.

251
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,800
So our message of low taxes doesn't connect.

252
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,560
And so my job is not to worry about those people.

253
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,040
I'll never think they'd say that they should take first the responsibility and care for the last-

254
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,480
Now here's the problem.

255
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,800
Mitt Romney was full of shit.

256
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,240
He claims that this 47% of people will vote for the president no matter what.

257
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,320
But if you look at the actual reasons as to why some of that 47% pay no federal income tax,

258
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,000
that claim is quickly exposed as delusional.

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,560
First off, a large part of that 47% are the elderly,

260
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,360
who in one sense do depend on state welfare,

261
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,320
but certainly did not exclusively vote for Barack Obama, believe it or not.

262
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,680
And aside from the elderly, there's also the working poor who,

263
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,920
despite having a job, don't earn enough to pay federal income tax.

264
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,000
And there's exemptions for things like households with young children.

265
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,200
And notably, the rich don't pay federal income tax because they know how to avoid it.

266
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,360
And they're certainly not voting overwhelmingly for Barack Obama either.

267
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,440
And let's briefly address Stefan's point,

268
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,600
where he says that it's hard to get people to vote for a contraction of the state

269
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,880
when they're dependent on it.

270
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,920
So we can infer from that that he thinks the Republicans

271
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,120
are for contracting the state and reducing spending.

272
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,000
And I know they say they're for that,

273
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,080
but the most recent Republican president, George W. Bush,

274
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,560
oversaw an enormous percentage increase in government spending.

275
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,080
Way more than Bill Clinton.

276
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,120
Wars aren't cheap, it turns out.

277
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,440
And if you're for reducing state spending,

278
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,040
then the recent history of the Republican Party should turn you right off.

279
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
Anyway, let's get back to Rome and move on to our next section.

280
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
So we're going to start off this section by looking at a quote about women

281
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,600
from Stefan's conclusion to his video.

282
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
And then we'll work backwards from that.

283
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
Now, here's a quote.

284
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,680
I put this out there for discussion.

285
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,240
I have not figured out all of my perspectives on this.

286
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,440
I put this out for our discussion and we'll put the source to this below.

287
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,680
An increase in the influence of women in public life

288
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,760
has often been associated with national decline.

289
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,520
The later Romans complained that although Rome ruled the world,

290
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,120
women ruled Rome.

291
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,120
In the 10th century, a similar tendency was observed in the Arab empire.

292
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,040
The women demanding admission to the professions hitherto monopolized by men.

293
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,760
What, wrote the contemporary historian Ibn Bessan,

294
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,680
have the professions of clerk, tax collector or preacher to do with women?

295
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,720
These occupations have always been limited to men alone.

296
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,440
Many women practiced law while others obtained posts as university professors.

297
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,960
There was an agitation for the appointment of female judges,

298
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,280
which however does not appear to have succeeded.

299
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,640
Soon after this period, government and public order collapsed

300
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
and foreign invaders overran the country.

301
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,120
The resulting increase in confusion and violence made it unsafe for women

302
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,640
to move unescorted in the streets

303
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,480
with the result that this feminist movement collapsed.

304
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,160
I leave you to ponder that one

305
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,680
and please let me know what you think in the comments.

306
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,360
So there you go.

307
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,120
Once women are given power, civilizations collapse.

308
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,960
I've heard that one before.

309
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
But it's okay though.

310
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,520
Stefan didn't really say that, of course.

311
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,920
He just quoted someone else saying it.

312
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,880
He just threw it out there totally randomly,

313
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,680
just as a topic for discussion.

314
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,240
Now this tactic of sneakily hiding behind his source is especially funny here

315
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,280
because until that point Stefan had, in his conclusion,

316
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,720
been quoting almost verbatim from that same source,

317
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,160
which is Sir John Glubb's The Fate of Empires.

318
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,680
And let's take a look.

319
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,040
Like out of nowhere, boom!

320
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,400
Some small group, kind of ignored beforehand, just explodes and grows and spreads

321
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,920
and this is sort of the pioneers as they're bursting out.

322
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,520
And rather than virtue and action,

323
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,000
there is this interminable engagement in intellectual debate.

324
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,200
But these intellectual arguments, they rarely lead to any kind of agreement

325
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,280
because, and it's kind of tragic, you know, way back in the day,

326
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,920
used to have just a very few number of elite intellectual institutions,

327
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,080
you know, Harvard and Cambridge and Oxford and so on.

328
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,160
And now it's like every city, every town, every block, it sometimes seems them.

329
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
So through this process of debate rather than action,

330
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,280
there tends to be an intensification of hostilities in the political realm.

331
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,640
There is an influx of foreigners, right?

332
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,760
Because it's a wealthy region, Rome and Greece and the West,

333
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,000
it's wealthy so people want to get in.

334
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,600
And so there's an end to sort of cultural or ethnic homogeneity

335
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
and we can just look at New York and just walk around the streets of New York

336
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,240
and see how many descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers are around.

337
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,680
The heroes of empires in seemingly terminal decline are always the same.

338
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
You got your athlete, you got your singer,

339
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,760
you got your pretty person, you got your actor.

340
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,840
And so if we look at way back in Arab empires in Baghdad,

341
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,000
in the golden days of Harum al-Rashid,

342
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,640
the Arabs were actually a minority in the capital imperial city of Istanbul.

343
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,960
And this is in the great days or in the significant or powerful days of Ottoman rule.

344
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
Now, did you notice that he fucked that last one up?

345
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,120
He accidentally read out two sentences as if they were one sentence.

346
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,000
And as a result he created a history Frankenstein's monster

347
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
where Istanbul is somehow the capital of Baghdad

348
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,400
and Harun al-Rashid, who lived in the 700s, is now the leader of the Ottoman Empire somehow.

349
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,440
Which didn't even exist for another 500 years.

350
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,240
So Stefan is about a thousand miles and five centuries out there.

351
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,320
And that's the real problem with just reading things out to support your arguments

352
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,480
without really understanding them.

353
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,520
So anyway, after basically just straight up reading John Glubb's workout,

354
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,840
when he gets to the section on women's rights,

355
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,760
Stefan picks that point to be like,

356
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,280
oh well, this is just a quote here, I'm quoting someone else.

357
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,640
It's just food for thought, not my opinion.

358
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,120
You know, he's trying to fly the anti-woman part of the argument under the radar there.

359
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,840
So what does Stefan himself actually think about women?

360
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,160
And this is taken from his video entitled,

361
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,440
The Matriarchal Lineage of Corruption.

362
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,920
Women who choose the assholes will fucking end this race.

363
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,960
They will fucking end this human race.

364
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,280
If we don't start holding them a-fucking-countable.

365
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,520
Women who choose assholes guarantee child abuse.

366
00:23:51,520 --> 00:24:00,320
Women who choose assholes guarantee criminality, sociopathy, politicians.

367
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,560
All the cold-hearted jerks who run the world

368
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,680
came out of the vaginas of women who married assholes.

369
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,440
And I don't know how to make the world a better place

370
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,280
without holding women accountable for choosing assholes.

371
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,640
If asshole wasn't a great reproductive strategy, it would have been gone long ago.

372
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,280
Women keep that black bastard flame alive.

373
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,880
They cup their hands around it, they protect it with their bodies.

374
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,800
They keep the evil of the species going by continually choosing these guys.

375
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
If being an asshole didn't get women, there would be no assholes left.

376
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,160
If women chose nice guys over assholes,

377
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,920
we would have a glorious and peaceful world in one generation.

378
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,480
So women are the root of all evil and will end the human race, apparently.

379
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,600
And I have a question,

380
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,600
why is everything so cataclysmic with these alt-right people?

381
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,320
You know, women won't go out with, quote,

382
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,040
nice guys, so the human race is facing annihilation, apparently.

383
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,800
Why does every problem have to be an extinction-level event?

384
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,160
I saw some guy recently say that Black Lives Matter will end Western civilization.

385
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,080
Yeah, Black Lives Matter.

386
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,120
You know, we survived the Napoleonic Wars,

387
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,640
and the breakup of the empires, and the rise of Nazism,

388
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,960
but, you know, some black people who are annoyed about police shooting at them,

389
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,400
well, that's game over for Western civilization.

390
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
Anyway, with regards to Rome,

391
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,280
Stefan does think women are somewhat responsible for the fall of the city

392
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,840
because they just weren't having enough babies, you see.

393
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,040
And there's strong evidence of a steady decline in population

394
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,480
across the entire empire from the 2nd century CE on.

395
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,080
And by the 500s, there were only 6,000 people left in Rome by.

396
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,080
A thousand.

397
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,880
And why this fairly drastic reduction in population occurred,

398
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,640
well, nobody knows for sure.

399
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,560
Though the sort of luxurious lifestyle and the fact that a lot of women became

400
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,800
less interested in producing and raising children certainly played some part in that.

401
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,600
So then, the depopulation of the city of Rome.

402
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
Stefan says no one knows for sure why it happened,

403
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
which isn't true,

404
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,800
but that loosening of women's morality played a part.

405
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,800
So Stefan quotes the low population of the city of Rome by the time of the 500s.

406
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,720
And now, I'd say that, as well as the aforementioned plagues,

407
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,520
the sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths,

408
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,400
and the sack of Rome in 455 by the Vandals,

409
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,000
probably had more to do with the population decline

410
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,240
than the lifestyles of the Roman women.

411
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,920
But the real truth here is that the importance of the city of Rome

412
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,440
had been waning for a very long time before that.

413
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,760
Stefan doesn't mention it here, but by the time Rome was sacked by the Visigoths,

414
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,960
it wasn't the capital of the Western Empire anymore,

415
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,480
and it hadn't been the capital for at least a hundred years.

416
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,640
In 286, Diocletian moved the capital from Rome to Milan,

417
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,480
and it was later moved to Ravenna,

418
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,520
and it's the fall of Ravenna in 476 that is typically marked by historians,

419
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,560
as the end of the Western Roman Empire.

420
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,320
Stefan really seems to have the blinders on when it comes to women's rights.

421
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,560
Let's take a look at another time he quotes a source talking about women.

422
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,240
So by the late Republic, a rich wife, who could divorce and take her wealth with her,

423
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,000
had a real threat against her husband and could wield influence over him.

424
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,200
This increasing female power manifested in escalating sexual promiscuity and adultery.

425
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
And I guess the modern equivalent would be,

426
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm going to drag you through the family court system,

427
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,960
and that's how I'm going to have power over you, and so I'm going to be more bullying.

428
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,400
And one historian wrote,

429
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,360
Roman men deplored the fact that these rich women were more concerned

430
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,160
with their own figures and luxuries than with their families.

431
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,400
Unlike the good old time matrons, according to the historian Tacitus around 100 CE,

432
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,800
these modern women did not spend time with their children and did not nurse their infants,

433
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,880
but left them to slave wet nurses.

434
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,040
Furthermore, children were handed over to be raised by child minders,

435
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,920
usually the most useless slaves of the household.

436
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,480
Now, I worked in a daycare and there were some nice people there,

437
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,880
but a lot of them are kind of like minimum wage people and so on.

438
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,960
They would be the least economically productive or valuable people to have raise your children.

439
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,920
So that quote there is from Family Values in Ancient Rome by Richard Sala,

440
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,760
and it's some excellent selective quoting by Stefan.

441
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,520
Now, first of all, all this text on the screen right here came from the article by Richard Sala,

442
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,880
so I don't know why Stefan singles out the last section by saying

443
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
one historian wrote and put in quotation marks around it,

444
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,560
because that one historian also wrote all of these sections as well.

445
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,520
But whatever Stefan's motivation for doing that,

446
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,840
if we read this article by Sala in its entirety, we see what Stefan chose to leave out.

447
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,160
And the two sentences preceding Stefan's quotes here read as follows.

448
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,920
The Romans had their own evolutionary story about family mores,

449
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,480
and it had nothing to do with the invention of affection

450
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,280
which they took to be natural and eternal in the family.

451
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,600
However, their story did contain elements of the decline of paternal authority and the stable family.

452
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,160
Emphasis on the word story there.

453
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,240
And then Sala goes on to write everything that Stefan quotes in this video.

454
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,840
Now, it's clear that Sala's presenting what Roman authors thought of family values in ancient Rome,

455
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,880
not what those family values actually were.

456
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,520
And this is made all the more obvious when later Sala goes on to write.

457
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,480
What is interesting about these earliest Latin authors

458
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,720
is that they are already deploring the moral decline of their own time.

459
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,680
In short, the earliest Latin authors were already writing of the breakdown of the good

460
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,360
orderly family in which the Pater Familius maintained authority over his wife and children.

461
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,800
If there was ever a better age before the decline, it must have been in the prehistoric era.

462
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,880
An alternative interpretation, one that I lean towards,

463
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,840
is that the golden age before the moral decline never existed in reality,

464
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,040
but was a later invention by Roman authors

465
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,920
who certainly had no reliable historical evidence for moral trends.

466
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,920
That is to say, the narrative of moral decline of the family

467
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,760
was based on a historical mirage of a better past, and it was no more than a mirage.

468
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,280
So then, a question.

469
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,440
What is it with these alt-right guys and not reading their own sources?

470
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,560
I'd say about half the time I go and check a source, it says the opposite of what they say it does.

471
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,600
And I really can't tell to what degree they're willfully misrepresenting the sources here, you know?

472
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,720
I don't know if it's scarier if they know they're lying,

473
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,800
or if they think they're telling the truth.

474
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,040
It's either incompetence or malice, and I can't tell which.

475
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,760
So, thoughts in the comments, please.

476
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,280
Now, Stefan does mention at least one form of moral decline

477
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,440
that doesn't have anything to do with women.

478
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,280
Let's take a look.

479
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,720
And Greece, in its own decline, just collapsed or decayed, I guess you could say,

480
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,680
into a pretty lawless and disreputable nation.

481
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,760
And then they were conquered by the Romans, 146 BC,

482
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,240
because they had decayed and had become selfish and had become lazy

483
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,560
and become ridiculously self-critical at the same time

484
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,880
as there were these ridiculously high levels of hedonism.

485
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,680
And they then were conquered from outside.

486
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,600
And there's this grim cycle, which we'll talk more in just a moment.

487
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,320
It was a very decadent and brutal society, right?

488
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,760
The Colosseum would get so soaked with blood

489
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,240
during the battles in there, the gladiatorial battles,

490
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,920
that they would shovel new sand on the blood hoping to soak it up

491
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,640
so it wasn't too unstable for the next round of fighters.

492
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,120
383 AD, captive barbarians were being fed to wild animals in the Colosseum.

493
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,600
And that is not good.

494
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,400
So that's Rome's moral decay as represented by the violence of the Colosseum.

495
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,880
And there's two main problems with this picture.

496
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,040
The first is that Rome had been doing horrible things to people in arenas

497
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,080
for centuries before the dates the fan mentioned.

498
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,200
We can look at Suetonius talking about Caligula,

499
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,840
who was only the third emperor of Rome, feeding prisoners to wild beasts without a trial.

500
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,040
Now Christians, particularly during the times when Christianity was persecuted in the empire,

501
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:54,720
didn't much like the practice of people being fed to animals in arenas, for obvious reasons.

502
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
And that matters because in the early fourth century,

503
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,320
Emperor Constantine came to power and he was the first Christian emperor.

504
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,280
And a relevant lore of Constantine's is quoted in the Codex Theodosianus,

505
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,040
which was a fifth century compilation of all the edicts and laws issued under Christian emperors.

506
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,920
And I quote,

507
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,560
Bloody spectacles are not suitable for civil ease and domestic quiet.

508
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,520
Wherefore, since we have prescribed gladiators,

509
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,080
those who have been accustomed to be sentenced to such work as punishment for their crimes,

510
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,360
you should cause the serve in the mines,

511
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,560
so that they may be punished without shedding their blood.

512
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,400
Constantine Augustus.

513
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,560
Now not that this actually put an immediate stop to gladiatorial combat or anything,

514
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,960
but the more violent arena events did generally decline under a succession of Christian emperors,

515
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,080
coinciding, oddly enough, with the latter days of the Western Empire.

516
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,320
And if I were to play devil's advocate here,

517
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,760
I could say that these reformers trying to ban gladiator fights

518
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,240
were an early example of liberal, PC, social justice types,

519
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,400
who were so pathologically altruistic that they were willing to undermine

520
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,560
the centuries-old masculine tradition of gladiatorial combat.

521
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,200
The decline of the arena shows an erosion of masculine Roman culture

522
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,760
right before the fall of the Empire.

523
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,280
Blah, blah, blah.

524
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,560
And that's the ideologue's approach to history right there.

525
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,760
It doesn't matter what actually happened, just spin it to support your position regardless.

526
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,280
And one more point on moral decay here.

527
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,880
There's a Roman legend of the first generation of Romans

528
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,840
called the Kidnapping of the Sabine Women.

529
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,640
And as the Romans tell it, the first generation of Romans were mostly men,

530
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,400
and they didn't have enough women to establish enough families.

531
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,680
So what they did was, they announced a huge festival

532
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,960
and invited people from all the nearby towns to attend,

533
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,520
and then, at a signal from Romulus, the Romans grabbed all the women,

534
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,560
fought off the men, and ran away.

535
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,280
And that's a classic comic caper right there,

536
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,000
but absolutely horrific if you actually think through any of the particulars.

537
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,320
So why am I telling you about the Kidnapping of the Sabine Women?

538
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,520
Well, my point here is that the early Romans weren't always moral and virtuous.

539
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,360
If morality has one constant throughout history,

540
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:25,520
it's that the preceding generation views the next generation as the worst, most immoral lot yet.

541
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,320
But that doesn't make it true.

542
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,840
So let's talk about something a little more concrete than concepts of morality and virtue.

543
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,280
Now, this is the mind-blowing aspect of it.

544
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,880
Just put this into your cogitator and take it for a hamster wheel spin.

545
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,840
For all of this peace, all of this amazing public infrastructure,

546
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,240
these roads, the astonishing roads that were really the backbone of the army's strength,

547
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,280
the legal system, the soldiers, the courts, everything,

548
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:07,840
for all of this, the ordinary Roman citizen worked for only two days a year to pay his taxes.

549
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,760
Let me say it again, brothers and sisters!

550
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,440
The ordinary Roman citizen worked for only two days a year to pay his taxes.

551
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:15,940
Okay.

552
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,600
A little bit more at the end, which we'll get to, but just think of that.

553
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,480
Just think of that.

554
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,160
So then, the average Roman citizen paid his taxes by working only two days a year.

555
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,400
And man, I hunted this source all over the internet, but I found it eventually.

556
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,000
I think.

557
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,320
An American historian called J. Rufus Fiers put out an audiobook called History of Freedom.

558
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,360
And the two days a year thing comes from chapter 9 called Freedom in the Roman Empire.

559
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,320
And I think it was from here that Stefan got it,

560
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,560
because all of Stefan's other points in this section also come from this chapter of Fiers' audiobook.

561
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,160
The Roman Empire of Titus stretched from the

562
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,920
Isle of Britain all the way out to the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys of

563
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,440
Iraq today, and from the North Sea to the sands of the Sahara.

564
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,800
We remember the case of Saint Paul when he is arrested and about to be beaten by a tribune.

565
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,120
He says, you cannot beat me, it is against my rights as a Roman citizen.

566
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,520
And the tribune says, I don't believe you.

567
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,800
Paul pulls out his papers.

568
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,040
How did you get to be a Roman citizen?

569
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,400
I had to pay a bribe to get one.

570
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,840
Because for this wealth and prosperity, this protection by a superb army,

571
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:46,560
for this infrastructure of roads, the ordinary Roman works two days a year to pay his taxes.

572
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,560
Now J. Rufus Fiers declines to show his workings here,

573
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,720
so I can't actually be sure how he arrived at two days a year.

574
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,840
And from listening to his audiobook, Fiers also has a very clear modern political bias,

575
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,160
so I wouldn't be surprised if he was fudging the numbers a little bit, to be honest.

576
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,760
But I don't know.

577
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,520
Now, there is a book in the reading list that came with the audiobook

578
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,400
that contains the two days worth of tax thing.

579
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,520
And that's entitled,

580
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,760
Preparing America's Foreign Policy for the 21st Century.

581
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,840
And that's a collection of talks and discussions held at the University of Oklahoma in 1999

582
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,440
by a bunch of professors and foreign policy experts.

583
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,400
And the two days quote is in a section called

584
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,440
The Roman Experience Commentary and Discussion.

585
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,760
And that chapter is authored by J. Rufus Fiers.

586
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,320
Now, if this book's intended as a source, then that's quite funny, to be honest.

587
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,280
I like the audacity of just quoting yourself.

588
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
But it might not be meant to be a source.

589
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,720
I don't know.

590
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,280
It might just be an instance of the professor putting his own book on the reading list, you know.

591
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,160
Anyway, just for the sake of this argument,

592
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,320
I'm gonna assume that the two days a year thing is true.

593
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,040
So, okay.

594
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,200
The average Roman citizen pays his taxes in just two days of work.

595
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,360
Well, the first thing to note here is the phrase

596
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,160
average citizen is not the same as average inhabitant.

597
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,080
The Roman understanding of the word citizen is not the same as ours.

598
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,040
Not everyone in the empire was a citizen.

599
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,040
Rome was a slave state, for starters, and slaves were considered property, not citizens.

600
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,680
Actually, before the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD,

601
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:36,960
pretty much only three Roman men born on the Italian peninsula were considered full citizens.

602
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,520
Inhabitants of the other provinces of the empire were not full citizens.

603
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,280
And this is significant because Italy itself was largely exempt from taxation

604
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,440
until Diocletian's tax reforms in 290 AD.

605
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:58,080
So to be a full Roman citizen before both the Edict of Caracalla and Diocletian's reforms

606
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,840
means that you're not likely to be paying taxes anyway.

607
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,240
And so we have to ask, what period of time is Stefan talking about?

608
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,280
Stefan says taxes were paid in two days of work

609
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,640
except for an increase near the end of the empire,

610
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,840
and wouldn't that be narratively convenient?

611
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,880
Well, the section of Fier's audiobook the quote comes from

612
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,200
is talking about an average day in the life of a citizen of Pompeii.

613
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,200
And Pompeii was destroyed in 79 AD, so we're necessarily talking earlier than that.

614
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,480
Relatively early empire, and long before the Edict of Caracalla.

615
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,840
Meaning most full Roman citizens at this point were exempt from most taxes,

616
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,280
so it's not surprising they were quite low, to be honest.

617
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,200
And I'm very interested if Stefan thinks this system would work today.

618
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,160
Imagine President Trump comes to office and he says,

619
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,760
okay everyone, all American citizens are now exempt from taxation.

620
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,360
Except from now on only white men who were born here count as citizens.

621
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,400
And also we're bringing slavery back.

622
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,400
And by the way, I've just declared war on Canada

623
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,960
so that we can go and steal all of their things and get more slaves.

624
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,640
I imagine there'd be somewhat of a mixed reaction.

625
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,720
Also, I'm reminded of Stefan talking about the Grain Doll.

626
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,800
Now the expansion of the doll of the welfare state drove steep rises in Roman taxes.

627
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,160
But how does this work in Stefan's world?

628
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,920
I mean, the Grain Doll was brought in before Pompeii was destroyed,

629
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,800
and it didn't go away or anything.

630
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,840
The Grain Doll was around throughout this whole period, so...

631
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,320
Stefan at one point makes it seem like the citizens of Rome were struggling

632
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,040
under the heavy tax burden of paying for the welfare of all the lazy scroungers,

633
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,920
while at another point making it seem like the Romans were paying almost no taxes

634
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,640
and enjoying economic freedom and growth.

635
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,280
You know, which is it? It can't be both.

636
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,680
And I'd like now to consider one point in Stefan's video where he either ignores

637
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,360
or just fails to mention a contradiction in his argument,

638
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,680
even when it's staring him right in the face.

639
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,680
Octavian took the name Augustus and became the first emperor of Rome,

640
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,080
ruling from 27 BC to 14 AD.

641
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,320
Now this did shrink some political freedom, you know, he's an emperor,

642
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,240
but it did lead to an expansion of economic freedom.

643
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,360
So Augustus did favour private enterprise, private property, and free trade.

644
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,040
So that's good, for merchants at least,

645
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,520
and for the general population who care more about bread than votes.

646
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,600
So under Augustus, taxes were lowered significantly.

647
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,040
He abolished tax farming, which was this practice of just saying to people

648
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,560
go get me a bunch of taxes and if you can't get them you have to pay me anyway.

649
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,160
And he regulated taxation as a whole.

650
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,720
So Trump-ish could be made the case.

651
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,640
So Stefan says that Augustus favoured private enterprise and free trade.

652
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,560
But then he immediately gives an example of Augustus doing something

653
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,560
which could very much be seen as the opposite of those things.

654
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,480
So tax farming was the way that Rome collected taxes until Augustus's reforms.

655
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,280
And what would happen is the state would auction off the rights to tax particular areas

656
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,040
to private individuals, and then that private individual

657
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,680
would be responsible for taxing the area.

658
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:37,360
And as you might imagine, it tended to be abused by people looking to maximise profit.

659
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,840
And Augustus abolished this practice and regulated the tax system,

660
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,240
which resulted, as Stefan points out, in lower taxes.

661
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,760
So could one not argue that this is an example of the state interfering with

662
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,960
and imposing restrictions on the free market?

663
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,800
Augustus abolished the right to trade tax farming rights

664
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,160
and brought tax under the regulation of the state.

665
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,600
So couldn't it be said that it was the free market that led to the unfairly high taxes

666
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,240
and the state bureaucracy that lowered them?

667
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,440
A point of comparison here is Augustus's creation

668
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,960
of an institutionalised police force and fire brigade.

669
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,960
Before Augustus, Rome's fire brigades were owned privately

670
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,960
and this is a bust of Marcus Licinius Crassus,

671
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,840
which is a hell of a name to say if you have a lisp, by the way,

672
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,920
who was the owner of such a privatised fire brigade

673
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,960
and not so coincidentally one of the richest men in human history.

674
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,440
You see, when there was a fire in Rome, Crassus would have his fire brigade turn up

675
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,560
and then do nothing while Crassus argued prices with the owner of the burning property.

676
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,360
And if they didn't agree to pay Crassus what he wanted,

677
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,480
he'd just leave and take his fire brigade with him.

678
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,360
And that's obviously not a very reliable or safe system of firefighting.

679
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,960
And so Augustus instituted a public fire brigade

680
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,920
and he actually levied a new tax on the sale of slaves in order to set it up.

681
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,240
What a tax and spend anti-free market socialist, one might say.

682
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,600
Also, while we're looking at this section of Stefan's video,

683
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,560
let's just, for a laugh, check out this source here.

684
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,920
The historian Oertle wrote in 1934,

685
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,160
quote, the victory of Augustus and of the West meant a repulse

686
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,840
of the tendencies towards state capitalism and state socialism

687
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,080
which might have come to fruition had Anthony and Cleopatra been victorious.

688
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,920
So in that war, if the central planning of Egypt had spread to Rome

689
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,800
it would have been a disaster and it didn't spread the other way

690
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,400
because Egypt was like the basket case for the Roman crane.

691
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,080
So first off, as we know by now, the importation of post-industrial revolution ideas

692
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,600
like socialism and capitalism into the ancient world is misleading and annoying.

693
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,480
But let's check out this Oertle guy.

694
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,640
So Stefan is quoting here from a Cato Institute article called

695
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,000
How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome.

696
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,520
And a more cynical man than me might suspect that an article by a libertarian think tank

697
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:21,040
talking about the evils of excessive government might just be a tiny bit biased.

698
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:28,000
But far-fetched speculation aside, the article includes two sources for its quotes by Oertle

699
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,640
and that's chapter 10 and chapter 12 of the Cambridge Ancient History

700
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,160
published in 1934 and 1939.

701
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,600
And when I saw that I thought, oh, that's quite a long time ago.

702
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,840
I wonder if there are any more recent editions of those books

703
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,880
and would you believe it, yes there are.

704
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,240
But I just want to detour a little before we get to those and mention Michael Rostovzef

705
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,880
better said that wrong

706
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,840
who is another historian quoted by both the Cato Institute and Stefan.

707
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,640
And he's someone else who compared his contemporary political situation to ancient Rome

708
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,240
and funnily enough whose Wikipedia article says

709
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,760
Rostovzef used terms such as proletariat, bourgeoisie and capitalism freely in his work

710
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,520
and the importation of those terms into a description of the ancient world

711
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,360
where they did not necessarily apply caused criticism.

712
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,360
So then, do you have those two names?

713
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,280
Right, so let's look at the updated version of Cambridge Ancient History.

714
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,840
And firstly, the newer edition of volume 10 published in 1996 says

715
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,960
It is probably true that there is no period in Roman history

716
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,320
on which the views of modern scholars have been more radically transformed in the last six decades.

717
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,840
It's therefore appropriate to indicate briefly in what respects this volume differs most significantly,

718
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,200
etc.

719
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,280
You get the point, the volume has been heavily revised.

720
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,200
And it goes on to outline the reasons for the changes in perspective

721
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,040
and then the revisions themselves.

722
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,960
And one of these revisions was to just drop Oertl's contribution entirely,

723
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,160
saying basically that it was interesting in its day but it no longer holds up.

724
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,880
Now then, the new edition of volume 12.

725
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,760
And this volume is openly critical of both Rostovzef and Oertl's tactic

726
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,200
of comparing contemporary politics to the ancient world.

727
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,320
And here's a quote taken from the introduction to the section where it first mentions Oertl.

728
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,760
In a rather loose way, modern bourgeois ideology-

729
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,800
Bourgeois?

730
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,720
Bourgeois, I can never say that.

731
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,480
ideology has thought it possible to identify the present-day bourgeoisie with the curiales

732
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,400
and has taken up their cause against the despotism of a totalitarian imperial state.

733
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,840
This is a singularly anachronistic projection of contemporary realities.

734
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,440
So what's my point here?

735
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,600
Well, the Cato Institute and by proxy Stefan are selectively quoting older editions

736
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,600
of the Cambridge ancient history from the 1930s

737
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,400
and ignoring the more recent editions that take a contrary and critical view

738
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,240
of those earlier editions.

739
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,440
But hey, I guess if you want to stop the wheel of history,

740
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,320
you also have to stop historical research.

741
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,800
Let's look at one of the times that Rostovzef shows up in Stefan's video.

742
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,280
And I'm going to show you two clips now, both concerning historian Edward Gibbon.

743
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,760
Gibbon, one of the famous historians who really knew the history of Rome and, you know,

744
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,800
turned his hands into arthritic claws writing all this stuff out.

745
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,880
He wrote once, he said that if a person were to pick the one period

746
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,280
in the history of the human race when mankind was happiest, he would, without hesitation,

747
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,360
choose that period of the second century AD when Rome was stable, when peace reigned

748
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,280
and trade reigned throughout the empire.

749
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,080
Trade was constantly rising and falling as empires rose and fall.

750
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,280
And that is really, really astonishing to think about.

751
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,600
Michael Rostovzef has described this as a period of quote,

752
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,520
almost complete freedom for trade and of splendid opportunities for private initiative.

753
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,800
And this is one of the reasons why, earlier Gibbon said,

754
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,680
this was some of the best places to live ever.

755
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,120
Two days a year, pay your taxes, five percent on customs duties,

756
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,400
which means locally produced goods.

757
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,800
There's no tax, no duties, no nothing at all.

758
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,960
And it's just astounding.

759
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,880
So firstly, this quote of Rostovzef is specifically talking about

760
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,000
the reign of Augustus and his immediate successors.

761
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:39,760
The time Gibbon identified as the best time to live was under the reign of the so-called

762
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,440
Five Good Emperors, which was a century later.

763
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,000
So let's read Gibbon's actual quote.

764
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,760
If a man were called to fix the period in the history of the world

765
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,480
during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous,

766
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,640
he would, without hesitation,

767
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,440
name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus.

768
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,160
The vast extent of the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power

769
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,360
under the guidance of virtue and wisdom.

770
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,560
And he goes on to mention the civil administration and the laws and the relative peace.

771
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,240
Nowhere here does Gibbon say anything about free trade or the economy or anything.

772
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,040
But he does mention the absolute power wielded by the state as a positive,

773
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,680
which I wouldn't think Stefan would be too keen on, to be perfectly honest.

774
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,760
So I'd like to wrap up my video by responding to a few key moments

775
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,080
from Stefan's conclusion to his video.

776
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,600
And the last thing that I want to say is that

777
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,320
people complain.

778
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,280
I mentioned this at the beginning.

779
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,000
People complain.

780
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,160
They say, well, nobody learns anything from history.

781
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,800
Well, it's like because nobody tells the truth about history.

782
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,080
So what has happened is the history of the West in particular,

783
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,160
the glories, the triumphs and the disasters,

784
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,280
the full span of the Shakespearean span of Western history

785
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,040
has been replaced by vituperative calumny and nagging.

786
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,480
Your ancestors were bad.

787
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,680
Your ancestors were mean.

788
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,320
They were sexist.

789
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,040
They were patriarchs.

790
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,600
They were racist.

791
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,320
They were homophobes.

792
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,840
They were bad, bad, bad.

793
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,080
Colonialism was just terrible, terrible, terrible.

794
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,920
They slaughtered all the natives and all, right?

795
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,800
The truth is that the West has bought by far the greatest values to the world.

796
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,600
The values of science, the values of reason, the values of the free market,

797
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,680
the values of modern medicine, the values of capitalism.

798
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:35,680
You are the offspring and the descendants of many heroes,

799
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:42,160
of many brave souls who fought very hard to bring and extend the freedoms you now enjoy.

800
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,480
If you feel that you are descended from evil,

801
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,960
you have nothing in your civilization to defend.

802
00:52:52,960 --> 00:53:06,080
You are children of heroes and only heroes get to keep their freedoms.

803
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,160
Oh, Stefan.

804
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,360
So included there is Stefan saying that nobody tells the truth about history,

805
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,520
but what is the truth about history according to him?

806
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,520
Truth for Molyneux appears to be whatever historical facts conform to his narrative,

807
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,400
and everything else is just, to quote him,

808
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,160
interminable engagement in intellectual debate.

809
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,640
Stefan also says that unless you think you're descended from heroes,

810
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,320
you have nothing to defend about your civilization.

811
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,600
And that's just not true.

812
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,320
I don't think I'm descended from heroes,

813
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:48,320
and I'll fully admit all the horrible things my society's done in the past,

814
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,520
but I'm still proud of things about my society.

815
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,520
You know, specifically here,

816
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,800
that I have the freedom to admit that my society's done those awful things.

817
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,600
The things I want to defend about my society are all the things that Stefan Molyneux

818
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,080
would take away if he had the chance.

819
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,920
You know, the fall of western civilization for me would be the reinstitution of slavery,

820
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,600
the taken away of women's rights, and things like that.

821
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,320
I don't like this ultra-nationalist idea

822
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,960
where you have to ignore all the bad things your culture or race has ever done.

823
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,440
You know, what does Stefan think happened to the Native American societies?

824
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,000
I don't know, I guess their taxes must have been too high or something.

825
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,840
Oh, god.

826
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,640
No, I'm not doing it.

827
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,840
I'm not watching it.

828
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,560
I'm all Molyneuxed out for a good six months, at least.

829
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,360
If you enjoyed this interminable intellectual debate,

830
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,040
please like and subscribe.

831
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,280
I know what they do now, I think.

832
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,680
I've also got a donation link on the YouTube banner there,

833
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,920
if you're feeling particularly generous,

834
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,360
and I've had quite a few donations of some very lovely people

835
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,120
whose names I won't read out,

836
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,600
because I don't know if they want me to, to be honest.

837
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,360
But you know who you are, and you are very much appreciated.

838
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,880
Also, if you'd like me to take a look at any specific video,

839
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,600
hit me up on either Twitter or Ask FM,

840
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,400
and there will be links to those in the description.

841
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,520
And look at me doing the proper YouTuber ending to the video,

842
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,000
rather than just cutting away mid-sentence.

843
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,400
I'm learning.

844
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,960
Next, I have to figure out motion graphics.
