00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
Hello there. This is a video about Stefan Molyneux, and in particular his video The Truth About the Fall of Rome

00:08.620 --> 00:16.400
Modern Parallels. Now his video is two and a half hours long, but I decided to take a look at it anyway, for two main reasons.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.080
Firstly, I love talking about Rome.

00:20.080 --> 00:25.320
I'm a big Roman history fan, and secondly, a particular pet peeve of mine is people

00:25.320 --> 00:31.760
cherry-picking from Roman history, and ancient history in general, to support some modern ideology.

00:31.960 --> 00:36.100
Not that I'm suggesting we should ignore history, or that there are no specific

00:36.360 --> 00:42.120
parallels between the ancient world and the modern, because I think there are plenty of legitimate points of comparison.

00:42.240 --> 00:48.540
Nor do I have any problem in particular with historical revisionism, if it's done for the right reasons.

00:48.540 --> 00:53.920
If you find new evidence to support or disprove some facets of current historical knowledge,

00:54.400 --> 00:56.400
excellent. Revise history.

00:56.560 --> 01:01.920
Now, what bothers me is people who approach history with a specific modern political agenda,

01:01.920 --> 01:06.080
and oh boy, does Stefan Molyneux have a political agenda.

01:06.560 --> 01:13.200
Now there's plenty of things that are gonna go wrong when you try to apply contemporary political leanings to the ancient world.

01:13.520 --> 01:17.340
You will end up missing things out that contradict your bias,

01:17.720 --> 01:20.640
and overemphasizing certain things that support it.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.320
And you might end up being guilty of what Aldous Huxley would call,

01:24.320 --> 01:30.720
temporal oversimplification, and compressing or stretching the timeline to suit your narrative.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.320
And this is of particular note when we're talking about Roman history.

01:35.040 --> 01:39.680
Ancient Roman civilization existed in so many forms, and for so long,

01:39.680 --> 01:44.800
that there's more than enough evidence to support any sort of modern political leaning.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.160
That is, as long as you're very selective about it.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.560
Rome was, at times, a kingdom, a republic, an empire,

01:52.560 --> 01:58.080
first a city-state that grew to control the Italian peninsula, and then the whole of the Mediterranean.

01:58.800 --> 02:04.240
And it existed for an enormous length of time. It was a republic for about 500 years,

02:04.800 --> 02:08.480
the Western empire fell after another 500 years,

02:08.480 --> 02:13.200
and the eastern half of the empire lasted for another thousand after that.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.640
And actually, something to keep in mind going forward,

02:16.640 --> 02:20.720
is that the entire history of the United States of America,

02:20.720 --> 02:24.080
from the Declaration of Independence to today,

02:24.080 --> 02:31.520
can fit neatly inside just what is considered the decline period of the Western Roman Empire.

02:31.520 --> 02:36.240
Trying to condense this wealth of history and apply it to just the last few decades

02:36.240 --> 02:42.800
of modern politics in the West is, well, difficult to say the least.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.800
And I'm mentioning all this now because Stefan Molyneux, bless him,

02:46.800 --> 02:48.960
does all of this in his video.

02:48.960 --> 02:54.960
He's gonna take his square peg views and try to hammer them into the round hole of Roman history.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.600
For two and a half hours.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.160
But what are Stefan's views, you might be wondering?

03:00.160 --> 03:06.160
Well, for the uninitiated, he's anti-state, anti-taxes, pro-free market,

03:06.960 --> 03:10.960
and in particular, he doesn't much like women, to put it lightly.

03:11.520 --> 03:17.760
And he applies this thinking relentlessly to basically everything, all the time.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.680
And before we get to Rome, actually, I've invented a game called

03:21.680 --> 03:24.240
What Is Stefan Molyneux Talking About?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.240
And I'm gonna show you some clips,

03:26.240 --> 03:30.880
and you have to try and guess the subject of the video that the clip came from.

03:32.160 --> 03:36.080
For men, an attack from the males of another tribe was the greatest evil.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.560
If the men of tribe B attack and conquer tribe A,

03:40.560 --> 03:44.400
the men of tribe A would generally be killed off or enslaved along with their descendants,

03:44.400 --> 03:47.680
thus effectively ending the transmission of their genes.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.840
The women, however, would usually be taken as spoils of war,

03:51.840 --> 03:54.880
which would allow the continuation of their genetics.

03:55.920 --> 04:01.360
Thus, men are conditioned by evolution to guard the tribal perimeters and fight to the death.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.800
That's from his video about Zootopia.

04:06.320 --> 04:06.960
Next clip.

04:07.840 --> 04:12.240
Feminists portray men as evil and patriarchal in order to provoke

04:12.240 --> 04:17.920
the white knight protects the eggs response that actually characterizes historical masculinity,

04:18.560 --> 04:22.720
while single mothers have to pretend that all men are shiftless and irresponsible,

04:22.720 --> 04:26.960
otherwise they themselves will be blamed by their children who are forced to grow up poor

04:27.680 --> 04:28.480
and fatherless.

04:29.040 --> 04:33.680
Almost always the same thing, because their mother chose to mate with a bad man,

04:33.680 --> 04:37.040
or drove away a good man, which is even worse.

04:37.760 --> 04:43.520
And that's from his video about Star Wars The Force Awakens, the last one now.

04:44.960 --> 04:51.120
Young men are worth substantially less in the sexual marketplace than young women,

04:51.920 --> 04:58.000
because young men do not have a lot of resources to provide to pregnant and child-raising women,

04:58.640 --> 05:03.200
while young women have a decade or two of fertility ahead of them.

05:04.640 --> 05:10.560
Young women so often mistake their sexual appeal for personal value,

05:11.280 --> 05:16.080
since it is infinitely easier to giggle and surf the tsunami of male desires

05:16.080 --> 05:19.520
than it is to struggle for a life of virtue and meaning.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.560
And that's from his video about the movie Frozen.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.960
And if you watched Frozen and came away talking about human fertilization

05:28.960 --> 05:34.800
and the sexual marketplace, well, you know, you definitely took a wrong turn somewhere.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.680
Now, I can't tell if Stefan is actually sitting there watching children's movies

05:39.680 --> 05:41.840
and genuinely getting all exasperated,

05:41.840 --> 05:45.760
or if he just views these recent popular movies as good vehicles

05:45.760 --> 05:48.960
for him to get his ideology to a wider audience.

05:48.960 --> 05:52.240
And it's tempting to just talk about Stefan on movies, to be honest,

05:52.240 --> 05:54.640
but we're here for ancient Rome right now.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.760
We'll save the movies for another day.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.200
So let's get to it.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.520
Because this is about saving Western civilization.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.760
We look deep into the past so that we can control the future.

06:05.760 --> 06:10.000
And your past has been so falsified to you, so lied about.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.520
You know, they constantly say,

06:11.520 --> 06:15.440
oh, the only thing that's constant in history is how little people learn from their history.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.080
No, you can absolutely learn from your history.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.080
You can save everything that our ancestors worked so hard to provide to us.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.680
But you must first know the facts about your history.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.160
And when you understand the facts about your history,

06:28.160 --> 06:32.560
which have been so falsified that you live in a matrix of leftist propaganda

06:32.560 --> 06:34.480
rather than any basic empirical facts,

06:34.480 --> 06:39.200
once you understand your history, we can, we might have the possibility,

06:39.200 --> 06:43.360
but this technology, this new Gutenberg press of the internet,

06:43.360 --> 06:48.800
we might have the chance of stopping the 10 generation cycle of empire,

06:48.800 --> 06:51.360
cycle of civilization in its tracks.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.880
We might be able to pile up enough facts, reason, evidence and knowledge

06:54.880 --> 06:59.600
and courage that we can stop the giant grim stone wheel of history

06:59.600 --> 07:05.440
from crushing yet another civilization as it seems poised to do with the West.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.320
Well now, who's ready to stop history?

07:08.320 --> 07:10.800
So we're gonna go through Stefan's video

07:10.800 --> 07:15.040
and examine what he claims are the parallels to the modern Western world.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.120
And as I said, his video is two and a half hours long.

07:19.760 --> 07:23.120
So for sanity's sake, I've decided to cut a lot for time

07:23.120 --> 07:25.520
and just focus on a few specific areas.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.760
Otherwise, we'll be here all day.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.080
But just so you can be sure, I'm not misrepresenting Stefan's arguments here.

07:32.880 --> 07:36.480
I'd encourage you all to go and watch Stefan's video.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.480
Who am I kidding?

07:39.520 --> 07:41.920
Okay, let's move on to our first section.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.680
Now in 58 BC, as we said, Rome began distributing free grain

07:45.680 --> 07:49.680
and this brought huge numbers of the rural poor into Rome.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.320
There was the, again, with ever this mass kind of movement,

07:52.320 --> 07:53.920
there's a push and there's a pull.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.320
The pull was that there was free grain.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.600
The push was the massive influx of slaves from the empire

07:59.600 --> 08:02.480
that the rural poor could not compete with.

08:03.280 --> 08:09.440
Now by the reign of Julius Caesar, 320,000 people were on this welfare dole.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.840
Now the expansion of the dole of the welfare state

08:13.840 --> 08:16.480
drove steep rises in Roman taxes.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.680
And if you're a citizen farmer

08:19.680 --> 08:21.600
and you can't compete with all this slave labor, right?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.840
I mean, then you have a big problem.

08:23.840 --> 08:27.520
You end up leaving your farm, going to the city and living on welfare.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.120
They were a burden on the state and what did they have to do with their time?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.240
Well, not much.

08:32.240 --> 08:37.120
Except cause trouble and contribute to an ever-increasing crime rate.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.560
Huh, now that that's got to be just a coincidence.

08:40.560 --> 08:46.640
And this sort of one-to-one comparison is the standard for the rest of Stefan's video.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.000
The displaced Roman farmers become the modern urban poor,

08:50.560 --> 08:54.480
our western democratic governments become the Roman Empire,

08:54.480 --> 08:59.120
modern immigrants into the west are cast as both the cheap Roman slave labor

08:59.120 --> 09:02.480
and later on the invading barbarian tribes.

09:03.040 --> 09:08.640
So here he's comparing Rome's grain dole to our modern idea of the welfare state

09:08.640 --> 09:12.480
and citing it as one of the reasons that the empire fell.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.360
And now I hate to start this section off with such a minor point,

09:15.360 --> 09:17.360
but see here where Stefan writes,

09:17.440 --> 09:22.320
The conquests of the third and second centuries BC brought so many slaves into the empire.

09:22.320 --> 09:27.520
Well, that doesn't really make sense because the empire didn't exist at that point

09:28.160 --> 09:32.240
and it didn't exist until Augustus a few hundred years later.

09:32.240 --> 09:38.640
What Stefan means to say is slaves were brought into the republic, not the empire.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.920
Now I'm not suggesting Stefan was trying to mislead anyone with this.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.560
He later writes republic in this section even,

09:44.560 --> 09:47.760
so I think saying empire here was just an honest error.

09:47.760 --> 09:53.200
I'm only highlighting it here because it's an indicator of the enormous length of time

09:53.200 --> 09:55.280
that Stefan is compressing.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.280
So, history lesson time.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.560
Before Rome's straight grain dole there was a grain subsidy,

10:00.560 --> 10:06.160
which was one of the reforms brought about under the tribune ships of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus.

10:06.960 --> 10:11.600
And they were two Roman politicians who tried to address the economic inequality

10:11.600 --> 10:16.320
brought about by slavery, forcing all the poorer farmers into unemployment.

10:16.320 --> 10:20.320
And Gaius Gracchus passed a grain law in 123 BC

10:20.320 --> 10:25.360
that set aside a certain amount of state grain to be distributed to the poor at a reduced cost.

10:25.920 --> 10:30.560
And this subsidized grain eventually became free grain in 58 BC,

10:30.560 --> 10:35.520
which was about 500 years before the western empire fell,

10:35.520 --> 10:40.640
and indeed about 30 years before the Roman empire even existed.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.240
So if the grain dole was one of the reasons the empire fell,

10:44.240 --> 10:47.200
it took kind of a long time to kick in.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.360
And I'd like to hear Stefan's solution to this apparent grain dole problem.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.560
Earlier he says,

10:52.560 --> 10:57.600
"...the answers are obvious, but political correctness prevents us from talking about them."

10:58.160 --> 10:59.440
Whatever that means.

10:59.440 --> 11:04.720
Stopping the grain dole would mean food riots and starvation in the capital at best.

11:04.720 --> 11:09.600
It's not like those people could just go and get jobs, you know, slaves had all the jobs.

11:09.600 --> 11:13.680
Really, the grain dole was a sensible state expenditure that, you know,

11:13.680 --> 11:17.680
beyond it being generally quite nice to feed the hungry if you're able to,

11:17.680 --> 11:22.640
it was necessary to prevent the poor from getting their torches and pitchforks out.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.720
But Stefan doesn't like state expenditures in general.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.800
Not even sensible ones.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.240
But it wasn't just the Roman army.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.920
Entire layers of bureaucracy grew.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.840
You know, like how we have national governments in Europe,

11:35.840 --> 11:38.640
and then we have the additional layer of the European Union,

11:38.640 --> 11:41.680
I guess except for the United Kingdom recently.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.120
So originally it was just like Rome, province, city.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.880
Boom. One, two, three, that was it.

11:46.880 --> 11:52.160
By the time of Diocletian, 284 to 305 AD, there were four emperors,

11:52.160 --> 11:56.160
four imperial courts, four Praetorian gods, four palaces, etc.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.440
Kind of a lot of overhead.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.080
So let's talk about Diocletian.

12:00.080 --> 12:04.800
Here, Stefan is presenting the Tetrarchy, which is the common name for the time when

12:04.800 --> 12:10.480
Rome had four emperors as an example of the growth of government bureaucracy.

12:10.480 --> 12:15.120
Now what he fails to mention is why the Tetrarchy was instituted.

12:15.120 --> 12:19.280
And since Diocletian's reforms are generally considered to have prevented

12:19.280 --> 12:23.600
the early collapse of the empire, I think this is worth exploring.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.680
So history lesson time again.

12:25.680 --> 12:30.720
In the third century AD, the Roman Empire went through what has been come to be known as

12:30.720 --> 12:33.200
the Crisis of the Third Century.

12:33.200 --> 12:38.320
Which, as you can probably guess, wasn't a terribly fun time for the Romans.

12:38.320 --> 12:43.840
There were invasions, plague, civil wars, assassinated emperors.

12:43.840 --> 12:47.600
The empire split into three separate empires for a while.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.880
It was... it was like Game of Thrones.

12:51.600 --> 12:57.040
Now the ascension of Diocletian and his following reforms typically mark the end of the crisis.

12:57.040 --> 13:01.520
He basically brought the empire back from the brink of collapse and stabilized it

13:02.160 --> 13:04.960
for a while, at least until he resigned.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.760
And, yes, he resigned.

13:07.760 --> 13:11.760
He was the emperor of Rome, the most powerful man in the world,

13:11.760 --> 13:14.960
and he resigned and went to farm cabbages.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.080
So Diocletian was a pretty interesting guy all around.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.960
As long as you weren't Christian, anyway.

13:20.960 --> 13:25.920
And one of the more interesting reforms was the Tetrarchy, the Rule of Four.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.440
So let's talk about that.

13:27.440 --> 13:34.160
Now the Roman emperors, during the Crisis of the Third Century, had a few relevant problems here.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.960
First was the succession of emperors.

13:36.960 --> 13:44.400
The transfer of power from one to another, quite often his assassin, was usually a very dangerous time.

13:44.400 --> 13:50.560
Next was the size of the empire, which made it extremely difficult for one man to rule by himself.

13:50.560 --> 13:54.560
He couldn't be everywhere at once, and you don't want to get attacked on two fronts

13:54.560 --> 13:58.640
when it can take months for a message from one front to reach the other.

13:58.640 --> 14:04.160
And you don't want to give too many troops and too much power to any one of your generals in particular,

14:04.160 --> 14:08.880
because if they end up winning their battles, they might turn around and march on you,

14:09.440 --> 14:12.160
and kill you, and become the new emperor.

14:12.160 --> 14:16.240
Because, after all, that's probably how you got into power as well.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.760
And another problem here is Rome, the city.

14:19.840 --> 14:26.000
Rome was not, as it turns out, all that well situated, at least in certain circumstances.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
You know, an emperor based in Rome is going to take a very long time to reach

14:30.000 --> 14:34.480
and respond to anything of note happening near the borders of his empire.

14:34.480 --> 14:39.840
Now Diocletian's response to these problems was first to appoint a co-emperor,

14:39.840 --> 14:45.520
and later they each appointed a junior emperor, and they divided their territory thusly.

14:45.520 --> 14:50.960
Now the result of this was that the empire was able to fight effectively on multiple fronts,

14:50.960 --> 14:58.240
with multiple leaders in regional capitals who all had the ability to exert power with some level of autonomy.

14:58.240 --> 15:03.280
And there was a more formalized line of succession from junior to senior emperor.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.640
And at least while Diocletian was around, it worked.

15:06.640 --> 15:10.160
And yes, it was a massive increase in state bureaucracy,

15:10.160 --> 15:14.160
but it brought an end to the crisis of the third century.

15:14.160 --> 15:19.600
Now Stefan condenses all this history into one sentence about the growth of government.

15:19.600 --> 15:24.400
And this is really emblematic of his oversimplification of history in general.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.400
In Stefan's history it goes,

15:26.400 --> 15:30.880
No Greindoll, Greindoll instituted, Rome collapses.

15:30.880 --> 15:34.720
One emperor, four emperors, Rome collapses.

15:34.720 --> 15:39.600
And this radical simplification of huge stretches of time is misleading,

15:39.600 --> 15:45.760
but it's necessary in order to make the sorts of comparisons to modern times Stefan is making.

15:45.760 --> 15:50.000
And now at one point Stefan offers a more direct contemporary comparison.

15:50.640 --> 15:55.920
As the parasites overwhelm the host, you have huge problems.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.240
So up to a third, about a third of the people in Rome at certain periods,

16:00.240 --> 16:03.600
were dependent on the state for their survival.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.480
And as Mitt Romney pointed out, I think it was in 2012,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.520
it's pretty hard for Republicans to get elected.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.880
Because close to half of the American population rely

16:12.880 --> 16:15.200
on the state for all or significant portions of their income,

16:15.200 --> 16:18.160
so why would they vote for a shrinkage of the state?

16:18.160 --> 16:20.880
And now there's a lot of things wrong with this comparison.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.200
First of all, Stefan mentions it's difficult for the Republicans to get elected.

16:25.200 --> 16:29.680
And well, it was very difficult indeed for anyone to be elected emperor,

16:29.680 --> 16:31.840
because they didn't have elections.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.760
But let's talk about Mitt Romney's 47% comments.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.120
And for those who haven't seen it, here is that leaked recording.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.720
There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.600
There are 47% who are with him who are dependent upon government,

16:47.600 --> 16:49.200
who believe that they are victims,

16:49.200 --> 16:52.000
who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them,

16:52.000 --> 16:57.200
who believe that they're entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.360
These are people who pay no income tax.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.160
47% of Americans pay no income tax.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.800
So our message of low taxes doesn't connect.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.560
And so my job is not to worry about those people.

17:08.640 --> 17:13.040
I'll never think they'd say that they should take first the responsibility and care for the last-

17:13.040 --> 17:14.480
Now here's the problem.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.800
Mitt Romney was full of shit.

17:16.800 --> 17:22.240
He claims that this 47% of people will vote for the president no matter what.

17:22.240 --> 17:28.320
But if you look at the actual reasons as to why some of that 47% pay no federal income tax,

17:28.320 --> 17:32.000
that claim is quickly exposed as delusional.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.560
First off, a large part of that 47% are the elderly,

17:36.560 --> 17:39.360
who in one sense do depend on state welfare,

17:39.360 --> 17:44.320
but certainly did not exclusively vote for Barack Obama, believe it or not.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.680
And aside from the elderly, there's also the working poor who,

17:47.680 --> 17:51.920
despite having a job, don't earn enough to pay federal income tax.

17:51.920 --> 17:56.000
And there's exemptions for things like households with young children.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.200
And notably, the rich don't pay federal income tax because they know how to avoid it.

18:01.200 --> 18:05.360
And they're certainly not voting overwhelmingly for Barack Obama either.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.440
And let's briefly address Stefan's point,

18:07.440 --> 18:11.600
where he says that it's hard to get people to vote for a contraction of the state

18:11.600 --> 18:12.880
when they're dependent on it.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.920
So we can infer from that that he thinks the Republicans

18:15.920 --> 18:19.120
are for contracting the state and reducing spending.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.000
And I know they say they're for that,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.080
but the most recent Republican president, George W. Bush,

18:26.080 --> 18:30.560
oversaw an enormous percentage increase in government spending.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.080
Way more than Bill Clinton.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.120
Wars aren't cheap, it turns out.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.440
And if you're for reducing state spending,

18:37.440 --> 18:41.040
then the recent history of the Republican Party should turn you right off.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.200
Anyway, let's get back to Rome and move on to our next section.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.880
So we're going to start off this section by looking at a quote about women

18:48.880 --> 18:51.600
from Stefan's conclusion to his video.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.600
And then we'll work backwards from that.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.840
Now, here's a quote.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.680
I put this out there for discussion.

18:57.680 --> 19:02.240
I have not figured out all of my perspectives on this.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.440
I put this out for our discussion and we'll put the source to this below.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.680
An increase in the influence of women in public life

19:09.680 --> 19:11.760
has often been associated with national decline.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.520
The later Romans complained that although Rome ruled the world,

19:15.520 --> 19:17.120
women ruled Rome.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.120
In the 10th century, a similar tendency was observed in the Arab empire.

19:21.120 --> 19:25.040
The women demanding admission to the professions hitherto monopolized by men.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.760
What, wrote the contemporary historian Ibn Bessan,

19:29.760 --> 19:33.680
have the professions of clerk, tax collector or preacher to do with women?

19:33.680 --> 19:36.720
These occupations have always been limited to men alone.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.440
Many women practiced law while others obtained posts as university professors.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.960
There was an agitation for the appointment of female judges,

19:44.960 --> 19:47.280
which however does not appear to have succeeded.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.640
Soon after this period, government and public order collapsed

19:50.640 --> 19:53.200
and foreign invaders overran the country.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.120
The resulting increase in confusion and violence made it unsafe for women

19:57.120 --> 19:58.640
to move unescorted in the streets

19:59.360 --> 20:02.480
with the result that this feminist movement collapsed.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.160
I leave you to ponder that one

20:06.160 --> 20:07.680
and please let me know what you think in the comments.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.360
So there you go.

20:09.360 --> 20:13.120
Once women are given power, civilizations collapse.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.960
I've heard that one before.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.120
But it's okay though.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.520
Stefan didn't really say that, of course.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.920
He just quoted someone else saying it.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.880
He just threw it out there totally randomly,

20:25.600 --> 20:27.680
just as a topic for discussion.

20:27.680 --> 20:32.240
Now this tactic of sneakily hiding behind his source is especially funny here

20:32.240 --> 20:35.280
because until that point Stefan had, in his conclusion,

20:35.280 --> 20:38.720
been quoting almost verbatim from that same source,

20:39.360 --> 20:42.160
which is Sir John Glubb's The Fate of Empires.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.680
And let's take a look.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.040
Like out of nowhere, boom!

20:45.040 --> 20:50.400
Some small group, kind of ignored beforehand, just explodes and grows and spreads

20:50.960 --> 20:53.920
and this is sort of the pioneers as they're bursting out.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.520
And rather than virtue and action,

20:57.520 --> 21:02.000
there is this interminable engagement in intellectual debate.

21:02.640 --> 21:07.200
But these intellectual arguments, they rarely lead to any kind of agreement

21:07.200 --> 21:11.280
because, and it's kind of tragic, you know, way back in the day,

21:11.280 --> 21:15.920
used to have just a very few number of elite intellectual institutions,

21:15.920 --> 21:18.080
you know, Harvard and Cambridge and Oxford and so on.

21:18.720 --> 21:22.160
And now it's like every city, every town, every block, it sometimes seems them.

21:22.880 --> 21:26.640
So through this process of debate rather than action,

21:26.640 --> 21:31.280
there tends to be an intensification of hostilities in the political realm.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.640
There is an influx of foreigners, right?

21:34.640 --> 21:37.760
Because it's a wealthy region, Rome and Greece and the West,

21:37.760 --> 21:40.000
it's wealthy so people want to get in.

21:40.720 --> 21:45.600
And so there's an end to sort of cultural or ethnic homogeneity

21:46.720 --> 21:49.600
and we can just look at New York and just walk around the streets of New York

21:49.600 --> 21:52.240
and see how many descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers are around.

21:52.240 --> 21:57.680
The heroes of empires in seemingly terminal decline are always the same.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.680
You got your athlete, you got your singer,

21:59.680 --> 22:01.760
you got your pretty person, you got your actor.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.840
And so if we look at way back in Arab empires in Baghdad,

22:05.840 --> 22:08.000
in the golden days of Harum al-Rashid,

22:08.960 --> 22:14.640
the Arabs were actually a minority in the capital imperial city of Istanbul.

22:15.600 --> 22:20.960
And this is in the great days or in the significant or powerful days of Ottoman rule.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.640
Now, did you notice that he fucked that last one up?

22:24.640 --> 22:29.120
He accidentally read out two sentences as if they were one sentence.

22:29.680 --> 22:34.000
And as a result he created a history Frankenstein's monster

22:34.000 --> 22:37.200
where Istanbul is somehow the capital of Baghdad

22:37.840 --> 22:44.400
and Harun al-Rashid, who lived in the 700s, is now the leader of the Ottoman Empire somehow.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.440
Which didn't even exist for another 500 years.

22:47.440 --> 22:52.240
So Stefan is about a thousand miles and five centuries out there.

22:52.240 --> 22:56.320
And that's the real problem with just reading things out to support your arguments

22:56.320 --> 22:58.480
without really understanding them.

22:58.480 --> 23:03.520
So anyway, after basically just straight up reading John Glubb's workout,

23:03.520 --> 23:05.840
when he gets to the section on women's rights,

23:05.840 --> 23:07.760
Stefan picks that point to be like,

23:07.760 --> 23:11.280
oh well, this is just a quote here, I'm quoting someone else.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.640
It's just food for thought, not my opinion.

23:14.640 --> 23:19.120
You know, he's trying to fly the anti-woman part of the argument under the radar there.

23:19.680 --> 23:23.840
So what does Stefan himself actually think about women?

23:23.840 --> 23:26.160
And this is taken from his video entitled,

23:26.720 --> 23:29.440
The Matriarchal Lineage of Corruption.

23:30.720 --> 23:35.920
Women who choose the assholes will fucking end this race.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.960
They will fucking end this human race.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.280
If we don't start holding them a-fucking-countable.

23:44.240 --> 23:49.520
Women who choose assholes guarantee child abuse.

23:51.520 --> 24:00.320
Women who choose assholes guarantee criminality, sociopathy, politicians.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.560
All the cold-hearted jerks who run the world

24:05.520 --> 24:09.680
came out of the vaginas of women who married assholes.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.440
And I don't know how to make the world a better place

24:13.440 --> 24:17.280
without holding women accountable for choosing assholes.

24:18.480 --> 24:24.640
If asshole wasn't a great reproductive strategy, it would have been gone long ago.

24:24.640 --> 24:29.280
Women keep that black bastard flame alive.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.880
They cup their hands around it, they protect it with their bodies.

24:32.880 --> 24:38.800
They keep the evil of the species going by continually choosing these guys.

24:40.400 --> 24:44.480
If being an asshole didn't get women, there would be no assholes left.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.160
If women chose nice guys over assholes,

24:48.160 --> 24:51.920
we would have a glorious and peaceful world in one generation.

24:52.800 --> 24:58.480
So women are the root of all evil and will end the human race, apparently.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.600
And I have a question,

24:59.840 --> 25:03.600
why is everything so cataclysmic with these alt-right people?

25:03.600 --> 25:06.320
You know, women won't go out with, quote,

25:06.320 --> 25:11.040
nice guys, so the human race is facing annihilation, apparently.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.800
Why does every problem have to be an extinction-level event?

25:14.800 --> 25:20.160
I saw some guy recently say that Black Lives Matter will end Western civilization.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.080
Yeah, Black Lives Matter.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.120
You know, we survived the Napoleonic Wars,

25:25.120 --> 25:28.640
and the breakup of the empires, and the rise of Nazism,

25:28.640 --> 25:32.960
but, you know, some black people who are annoyed about police shooting at them,

25:32.960 --> 25:36.400
well, that's game over for Western civilization.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.720
Anyway, with regards to Rome,

25:38.720 --> 25:43.280
Stefan does think women are somewhat responsible for the fall of the city

25:43.280 --> 25:45.840
because they just weren't having enough babies, you see.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.040
And there's strong evidence of a steady decline in population

25:49.680 --> 25:52.480
across the entire empire from the 2nd century CE on.

25:53.520 --> 25:58.080
And by the 500s, there were only 6,000 people left in Rome by.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.080
A thousand.

26:00.080 --> 26:06.880
And why this fairly drastic reduction in population occurred,

26:06.880 --> 26:08.640
well, nobody knows for sure.

26:10.320 --> 26:14.560
Though the sort of luxurious lifestyle and the fact that a lot of women became

26:14.560 --> 26:18.800
less interested in producing and raising children certainly played some part in that.

26:19.680 --> 26:23.600
So then, the depopulation of the city of Rome.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.400
Stefan says no one knows for sure why it happened,

26:27.200 --> 26:28.000
which isn't true,

26:28.640 --> 26:32.800
but that loosening of women's morality played a part.

26:32.800 --> 26:38.800
So Stefan quotes the low population of the city of Rome by the time of the 500s.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.720
And now, I'd say that, as well as the aforementioned plagues,

26:42.720 --> 26:45.520
the sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths,

26:45.520 --> 26:48.400
and the sack of Rome in 455 by the Vandals,

26:49.040 --> 26:52.000
probably had more to do with the population decline

26:52.000 --> 26:54.240
than the lifestyles of the Roman women.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.920
But the real truth here is that the importance of the city of Rome

26:57.920 --> 27:01.440
had been waning for a very long time before that.

27:01.440 --> 27:05.760
Stefan doesn't mention it here, but by the time Rome was sacked by the Visigoths,

27:05.760 --> 27:08.960
it wasn't the capital of the Western Empire anymore,

27:08.960 --> 27:12.480
and it hadn't been the capital for at least a hundred years.

27:12.480 --> 27:16.640
In 286, Diocletian moved the capital from Rome to Milan,

27:16.640 --> 27:18.480
and it was later moved to Ravenna,

27:18.480 --> 27:23.520
and it's the fall of Ravenna in 476 that is typically marked by historians,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.560
as the end of the Western Roman Empire.

27:26.560 --> 27:30.320
Stefan really seems to have the blinders on when it comes to women's rights.

27:31.120 --> 27:34.560
Let's take a look at another time he quotes a source talking about women.

27:35.280 --> 27:40.240
So by the late Republic, a rich wife, who could divorce and take her wealth with her,

27:41.120 --> 27:44.000
had a real threat against her husband and could wield influence over him.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.200
This increasing female power manifested in escalating sexual promiscuity and adultery.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.880
And I guess the modern equivalent would be,

27:50.880 --> 27:53.360
I'm going to drag you through the family court system,

27:54.160 --> 28:00.960
and that's how I'm going to have power over you, and so I'm going to be more bullying.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.400
And one historian wrote,

28:04.400 --> 28:07.360
Roman men deplored the fact that these rich women were more concerned

28:07.360 --> 28:10.160
with their own figures and luxuries than with their families.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.400
Unlike the good old time matrons, according to the historian Tacitus around 100 CE,

28:14.960 --> 28:18.800
these modern women did not spend time with their children and did not nurse their infants,

28:18.800 --> 28:20.880
but left them to slave wet nurses.

28:21.840 --> 28:25.040
Furthermore, children were handed over to be raised by child minders,

28:25.040 --> 28:27.920
usually the most useless slaves of the household.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.480
Now, I worked in a daycare and there were some nice people there,

28:30.480 --> 28:32.880
but a lot of them are kind of like minimum wage people and so on.

28:32.880 --> 28:38.960
They would be the least economically productive or valuable people to have raise your children.

28:38.960 --> 28:43.920
So that quote there is from Family Values in Ancient Rome by Richard Sala,

28:43.920 --> 28:47.760
and it's some excellent selective quoting by Stefan.

28:47.760 --> 28:53.520
Now, first of all, all this text on the screen right here came from the article by Richard Sala,

28:53.520 --> 28:56.880
so I don't know why Stefan singles out the last section by saying

28:56.880 --> 28:59.840
one historian wrote and put in quotation marks around it,

28:59.840 --> 29:04.560
because that one historian also wrote all of these sections as well.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.520
But whatever Stefan's motivation for doing that,

29:07.520 --> 29:13.840
if we read this article by Sala in its entirety, we see what Stefan chose to leave out.

29:13.840 --> 29:18.160
And the two sentences preceding Stefan's quotes here read as follows.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.920
The Romans had their own evolutionary story about family mores,

29:21.920 --> 29:24.480
and it had nothing to do with the invention of affection

29:24.480 --> 29:27.280
which they took to be natural and eternal in the family.

29:27.280 --> 29:33.600
However, their story did contain elements of the decline of paternal authority and the stable family.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.160
Emphasis on the word story there.

29:36.160 --> 29:40.240
And then Sala goes on to write everything that Stefan quotes in this video.

29:40.240 --> 29:45.840
Now, it's clear that Sala's presenting what Roman authors thought of family values in ancient Rome,

29:45.840 --> 29:48.880
not what those family values actually were.

29:48.880 --> 29:53.520
And this is made all the more obvious when later Sala goes on to write.

29:53.520 --> 29:56.480
What is interesting about these earliest Latin authors

29:56.480 --> 30:00.720
is that they are already deploring the moral decline of their own time.

30:00.720 --> 30:05.680
In short, the earliest Latin authors were already writing of the breakdown of the good

30:05.680 --> 30:11.360
orderly family in which the Pater Familius maintained authority over his wife and children.

30:11.360 --> 30:16.800
If there was ever a better age before the decline, it must have been in the prehistoric era.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.880
An alternative interpretation, one that I lean towards,

30:20.880 --> 30:25.840
is that the golden age before the moral decline never existed in reality,

30:25.840 --> 30:29.040
but was a later invention by Roman authors

30:29.040 --> 30:33.920
who certainly had no reliable historical evidence for moral trends.

30:33.920 --> 30:37.920
That is to say, the narrative of moral decline of the family

30:37.920 --> 30:43.760
was based on a historical mirage of a better past, and it was no more than a mirage.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.280
So then, a question.

30:45.280 --> 30:49.440
What is it with these alt-right guys and not reading their own sources?

30:49.440 --> 30:54.560
I'd say about half the time I go and check a source, it says the opposite of what they say it does.

30:54.560 --> 30:59.600
And I really can't tell to what degree they're willfully misrepresenting the sources here, you know?

30:59.600 --> 31:02.720
I don't know if it's scarier if they know they're lying,

31:02.720 --> 31:04.800
or if they think they're telling the truth.

31:04.800 --> 31:09.040
It's either incompetence or malice, and I can't tell which.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.760
So, thoughts in the comments, please.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.280
Now, Stefan does mention at least one form of moral decline

31:15.280 --> 31:17.440
that doesn't have anything to do with women.

31:18.080 --> 31:19.280
Let's take a look.

31:19.280 --> 31:24.720
And Greece, in its own decline, just collapsed or decayed, I guess you could say,

31:24.720 --> 31:27.680
into a pretty lawless and disreputable nation.

31:27.680 --> 31:31.760
And then they were conquered by the Romans, 146 BC,

31:31.840 --> 31:36.240
because they had decayed and had become selfish and had become lazy

31:36.240 --> 31:38.560
and become ridiculously self-critical at the same time

31:38.560 --> 31:40.880
as there were these ridiculously high levels of hedonism.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.680
And they then were conquered from outside.

31:45.680 --> 31:51.600
And there's this grim cycle, which we'll talk more in just a moment.

31:51.600 --> 31:56.320
It was a very decadent and brutal society, right?

31:56.320 --> 31:59.760
The Colosseum would get so soaked with blood

31:59.760 --> 32:02.240
during the battles in there, the gladiatorial battles,

32:02.240 --> 32:05.920
that they would shovel new sand on the blood hoping to soak it up

32:05.920 --> 32:08.640
so it wasn't too unstable for the next round of fighters.

32:09.200 --> 32:15.120
383 AD, captive barbarians were being fed to wild animals in the Colosseum.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.600
And that is not good.

32:18.320 --> 32:24.400
So that's Rome's moral decay as represented by the violence of the Colosseum.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.880
And there's two main problems with this picture.

32:26.880 --> 32:31.040
The first is that Rome had been doing horrible things to people in arenas

32:31.040 --> 32:34.080
for centuries before the dates the fan mentioned.

32:34.080 --> 32:37.200
We can look at Suetonius talking about Caligula,

32:37.200 --> 32:43.840
who was only the third emperor of Rome, feeding prisoners to wild beasts without a trial.

32:43.840 --> 32:49.040
Now Christians, particularly during the times when Christianity was persecuted in the empire,

32:49.040 --> 32:54.720
didn't much like the practice of people being fed to animals in arenas, for obvious reasons.

32:54.720 --> 32:57.440
And that matters because in the early fourth century,

32:57.440 --> 33:02.320
Emperor Constantine came to power and he was the first Christian emperor.

33:02.320 --> 33:07.280
And a relevant lore of Constantine's is quoted in the Codex Theodosianus,

33:07.280 --> 33:13.040
which was a fifth century compilation of all the edicts and laws issued under Christian emperors.

33:13.040 --> 33:13.920
And I quote,

33:13.920 --> 33:18.560
Bloody spectacles are not suitable for civil ease and domestic quiet.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.520
Wherefore, since we have prescribed gladiators,

33:21.520 --> 33:26.080
those who have been accustomed to be sentenced to such work as punishment for their crimes,

33:26.720 --> 33:29.360
you should cause the serve in the mines,

33:29.360 --> 33:32.560
so that they may be punished without shedding their blood.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.400
Constantine Augustus.

33:34.400 --> 33:38.560
Now not that this actually put an immediate stop to gladiatorial combat or anything,

33:38.560 --> 33:44.960
but the more violent arena events did generally decline under a succession of Christian emperors,

33:44.960 --> 33:50.080
coinciding, oddly enough, with the latter days of the Western Empire.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.320
And if I were to play devil's advocate here,

33:52.320 --> 33:55.760
I could say that these reformers trying to ban gladiator fights

33:55.760 --> 34:00.240
were an early example of liberal, PC, social justice types,

34:00.240 --> 34:04.400
who were so pathologically altruistic that they were willing to undermine

34:04.400 --> 34:08.560
the centuries-old masculine tradition of gladiatorial combat.

34:08.560 --> 34:13.200
The decline of the arena shows an erosion of masculine Roman culture

34:13.200 --> 34:15.760
right before the fall of the Empire.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.280
Blah, blah, blah.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.560
And that's the ideologue's approach to history right there.

34:20.560 --> 34:25.760
It doesn't matter what actually happened, just spin it to support your position regardless.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.280
And one more point on moral decay here.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.880
There's a Roman legend of the first generation of Romans

34:32.880 --> 34:35.840
called the Kidnapping of the Sabine Women.

34:35.840 --> 34:40.640
And as the Romans tell it, the first generation of Romans were mostly men,

34:40.640 --> 34:44.400
and they didn't have enough women to establish enough families.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.680
So what they did was, they announced a huge festival

34:47.680 --> 34:50.960
and invited people from all the nearby towns to attend,

34:51.520 --> 34:55.520
and then, at a signal from Romulus, the Romans grabbed all the women,

34:55.520 --> 34:58.560
fought off the men, and ran away.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.280
And that's a classic comic caper right there,

35:01.280 --> 35:06.000
but absolutely horrific if you actually think through any of the particulars.

35:06.640 --> 35:10.320
So why am I telling you about the Kidnapping of the Sabine Women?

35:10.320 --> 35:15.520
Well, my point here is that the early Romans weren't always moral and virtuous.

35:16.320 --> 35:19.360
If morality has one constant throughout history,

35:19.360 --> 35:25.520
it's that the preceding generation views the next generation as the worst, most immoral lot yet.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.320
But that doesn't make it true.

35:28.320 --> 35:33.840
So let's talk about something a little more concrete than concepts of morality and virtue.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.280
Now, this is the mind-blowing aspect of it.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.880
Just put this into your cogitator and take it for a hamster wheel spin.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.840
For all of this peace, all of this amazing public infrastructure,

35:47.840 --> 35:52.240
these roads, the astonishing roads that were really the backbone of the army's strength,

35:53.280 --> 35:57.280
the legal system, the soldiers, the courts, everything,

35:58.000 --> 36:07.840
for all of this, the ordinary Roman citizen worked for only two days a year to pay his taxes.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.760
Let me say it again, brothers and sisters!

36:09.760 --> 36:15.440
The ordinary Roman citizen worked for only two days a year to pay his taxes.

36:15.440 --> 36:15.940
Okay.

36:16.960 --> 36:21.600
A little bit more at the end, which we'll get to, but just think of that.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.480
Just think of that.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.160
So then, the average Roman citizen paid his taxes by working only two days a year.

36:30.160 --> 36:36.400
And man, I hunted this source all over the internet, but I found it eventually.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.000
I think.

36:38.000 --> 36:44.320
An American historian called J. Rufus Fiers put out an audiobook called History of Freedom.

36:44.320 --> 36:49.360
And the two days a year thing comes from chapter 9 called Freedom in the Roman Empire.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.320
And I think it was from here that Stefan got it,

36:52.320 --> 36:58.560
because all of Stefan's other points in this section also come from this chapter of Fiers' audiobook.

36:58.560 --> 37:02.160
The Roman Empire of Titus stretched from the

37:03.360 --> 37:07.920
Isle of Britain all the way out to the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys of

37:08.720 --> 37:13.440
Iraq today, and from the North Sea to the sands of the Sahara.

37:14.560 --> 37:18.800
We remember the case of Saint Paul when he is arrested and about to be beaten by a tribune.

37:19.600 --> 37:23.120
He says, you cannot beat me, it is against my rights as a Roman citizen.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.520
And the tribune says, I don't believe you.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.800
Paul pulls out his papers.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.040
How did you get to be a Roman citizen?

37:29.040 --> 37:30.400
I had to pay a bribe to get one.

37:30.960 --> 37:35.840
Because for this wealth and prosperity, this protection by a superb army,

37:36.480 --> 37:46.560
for this infrastructure of roads, the ordinary Roman works two days a year to pay his taxes.

37:47.120 --> 37:50.560
Now J. Rufus Fiers declines to show his workings here,

37:50.560 --> 37:54.720
so I can't actually be sure how he arrived at two days a year.

37:54.720 --> 37:59.840
And from listening to his audiobook, Fiers also has a very clear modern political bias,

37:59.840 --> 38:04.160
so I wouldn't be surprised if he was fudging the numbers a little bit, to be honest.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.760
But I don't know.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.520
Now, there is a book in the reading list that came with the audiobook

38:09.520 --> 38:12.400
that contains the two days worth of tax thing.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.520
And that's entitled,

38:14.080 --> 38:17.760
Preparing America's Foreign Policy for the 21st Century.

38:17.760 --> 38:23.840
And that's a collection of talks and discussions held at the University of Oklahoma in 1999

38:23.840 --> 38:27.440
by a bunch of professors and foreign policy experts.

38:27.440 --> 38:30.400
And the two days quote is in a section called

38:30.400 --> 38:33.440
The Roman Experience Commentary and Discussion.

38:33.440 --> 38:37.760
And that chapter is authored by J. Rufus Fiers.

38:37.760 --> 38:42.320
Now, if this book's intended as a source, then that's quite funny, to be honest.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.280
I like the audacity of just quoting yourself.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.280
But it might not be meant to be a source.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.720
I don't know.

38:48.720 --> 38:53.280
It might just be an instance of the professor putting his own book on the reading list, you know.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.160
Anyway, just for the sake of this argument,

38:56.160 --> 39:00.320
I'm gonna assume that the two days a year thing is true.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.040
So, okay.

39:01.040 --> 39:05.200
The average Roman citizen pays his taxes in just two days of work.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.360
Well, the first thing to note here is the phrase

39:07.360 --> 39:12.160
average citizen is not the same as average inhabitant.

39:12.160 --> 39:16.080
The Roman understanding of the word citizen is not the same as ours.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.040
Not everyone in the empire was a citizen.

39:19.040 --> 39:25.040
Rome was a slave state, for starters, and slaves were considered property, not citizens.

39:25.040 --> 39:29.680
Actually, before the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD,

39:29.680 --> 39:36.960
pretty much only three Roman men born on the Italian peninsula were considered full citizens.

39:36.960 --> 39:41.520
Inhabitants of the other provinces of the empire were not full citizens.

39:41.520 --> 39:47.280
And this is significant because Italy itself was largely exempt from taxation

39:47.280 --> 39:51.440
until Diocletian's tax reforms in 290 AD.

39:51.440 --> 39:58.080
So to be a full Roman citizen before both the Edict of Caracalla and Diocletian's reforms

39:58.080 --> 40:01.840
means that you're not likely to be paying taxes anyway.

40:01.840 --> 40:06.240
And so we have to ask, what period of time is Stefan talking about?

40:06.240 --> 40:09.280
Stefan says taxes were paid in two days of work

40:09.280 --> 40:12.640
except for an increase near the end of the empire,

40:12.640 --> 40:15.840
and wouldn't that be narratively convenient?

40:15.840 --> 40:18.880
Well, the section of Fier's audiobook the quote comes from

40:18.880 --> 40:23.200
is talking about an average day in the life of a citizen of Pompeii.

40:23.200 --> 40:29.200
And Pompeii was destroyed in 79 AD, so we're necessarily talking earlier than that.

40:29.840 --> 40:34.480
Relatively early empire, and long before the Edict of Caracalla.

40:34.480 --> 40:39.840
Meaning most full Roman citizens at this point were exempt from most taxes,

40:39.840 --> 40:43.280
so it's not surprising they were quite low, to be honest.

40:43.280 --> 40:47.200
And I'm very interested if Stefan thinks this system would work today.

40:47.920 --> 40:52.160
Imagine President Trump comes to office and he says,

40:52.160 --> 40:57.760
okay everyone, all American citizens are now exempt from taxation.

40:59.280 --> 41:05.360
Except from now on only white men who were born here count as citizens.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.400
And also we're bringing slavery back.

41:09.120 --> 41:12.400
And by the way, I've just declared war on Canada

41:12.400 --> 41:16.960
so that we can go and steal all of their things and get more slaves.

41:17.520 --> 41:20.640
I imagine there'd be somewhat of a mixed reaction.

41:20.640 --> 41:24.720
Also, I'm reminded of Stefan talking about the Grain Doll.

41:24.720 --> 41:30.800
Now the expansion of the doll of the welfare state drove steep rises in Roman taxes.

41:30.800 --> 41:34.160
But how does this work in Stefan's world?

41:34.160 --> 41:37.920
I mean, the Grain Doll was brought in before Pompeii was destroyed,

41:38.560 --> 41:40.800
and it didn't go away or anything.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.840
The Grain Doll was around throughout this whole period, so...

41:44.400 --> 41:48.320
Stefan at one point makes it seem like the citizens of Rome were struggling

41:48.320 --> 41:53.040
under the heavy tax burden of paying for the welfare of all the lazy scroungers,

41:53.040 --> 41:57.920
while at another point making it seem like the Romans were paying almost no taxes

41:57.920 --> 42:00.640
and enjoying economic freedom and growth.

42:00.640 --> 42:03.280
You know, which is it? It can't be both.

42:03.280 --> 42:07.680
And I'd like now to consider one point in Stefan's video where he either ignores

42:07.680 --> 42:11.360
or just fails to mention a contradiction in his argument,

42:11.360 --> 42:13.680
even when it's staring him right in the face.

42:14.480 --> 42:19.680
Octavian took the name Augustus and became the first emperor of Rome,

42:19.680 --> 42:22.080
ruling from 27 BC to 14 AD.

42:22.800 --> 42:26.320
Now this did shrink some political freedom, you know, he's an emperor,

42:27.040 --> 42:30.240
but it did lead to an expansion of economic freedom.

42:30.240 --> 42:35.360
So Augustus did favour private enterprise, private property, and free trade.

42:35.440 --> 42:39.040
So that's good, for merchants at least,

42:39.040 --> 42:41.520
and for the general population who care more about bread than votes.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.600
So under Augustus, taxes were lowered significantly.

42:45.600 --> 42:49.040
He abolished tax farming, which was this practice of just saying to people

42:49.040 --> 42:52.560
go get me a bunch of taxes and if you can't get them you have to pay me anyway.

42:53.440 --> 42:56.160
And he regulated taxation as a whole.

42:56.160 --> 43:00.720
So Trump-ish could be made the case.

43:01.280 --> 43:06.640
So Stefan says that Augustus favoured private enterprise and free trade.

43:06.640 --> 43:10.560
But then he immediately gives an example of Augustus doing something

43:10.560 --> 43:14.560
which could very much be seen as the opposite of those things.

43:14.560 --> 43:20.480
So tax farming was the way that Rome collected taxes until Augustus's reforms.

43:20.480 --> 43:25.280
And what would happen is the state would auction off the rights to tax particular areas

43:25.280 --> 43:29.040
to private individuals, and then that private individual

43:29.040 --> 43:31.680
would be responsible for taxing the area.

43:31.680 --> 43:37.360
And as you might imagine, it tended to be abused by people looking to maximise profit.

43:37.360 --> 43:41.840
And Augustus abolished this practice and regulated the tax system,

43:41.840 --> 43:46.240
which resulted, as Stefan points out, in lower taxes.

43:46.240 --> 43:51.760
So could one not argue that this is an example of the state interfering with

43:51.760 --> 43:54.960
and imposing restrictions on the free market?

43:55.280 --> 43:58.800
Augustus abolished the right to trade tax farming rights

43:58.800 --> 44:02.160
and brought tax under the regulation of the state.

44:02.160 --> 44:07.600
So couldn't it be said that it was the free market that led to the unfairly high taxes

44:07.600 --> 44:10.240
and the state bureaucracy that lowered them?

44:10.240 --> 44:13.440
A point of comparison here is Augustus's creation

44:13.440 --> 44:16.960
of an institutionalised police force and fire brigade.

44:16.960 --> 44:20.960
Before Augustus, Rome's fire brigades were owned privately

44:20.960 --> 44:24.960
and this is a bust of Marcus Licinius Crassus,

44:24.960 --> 44:27.840
which is a hell of a name to say if you have a lisp, by the way,

44:28.560 --> 44:31.920
who was the owner of such a privatised fire brigade

44:31.920 --> 44:36.960
and not so coincidentally one of the richest men in human history.

44:36.960 --> 44:41.440
You see, when there was a fire in Rome, Crassus would have his fire brigade turn up

44:41.440 --> 44:46.560
and then do nothing while Crassus argued prices with the owner of the burning property.

44:46.560 --> 44:49.360
And if they didn't agree to pay Crassus what he wanted,

44:49.360 --> 44:52.480
he'd just leave and take his fire brigade with him.

44:52.480 --> 44:57.360
And that's obviously not a very reliable or safe system of firefighting.

44:57.360 --> 45:00.960
And so Augustus instituted a public fire brigade

45:00.960 --> 45:05.920
and he actually levied a new tax on the sale of slaves in order to set it up.

45:05.920 --> 45:12.240
What a tax and spend anti-free market socialist, one might say.

45:12.240 --> 45:15.600
Also, while we're looking at this section of Stefan's video,

45:15.600 --> 45:18.560
let's just, for a laugh, check out this source here.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.920
The historian Oertle wrote in 1934,

45:21.920 --> 45:26.160
quote, the victory of Augustus and of the West meant a repulse

45:26.160 --> 45:29.840
of the tendencies towards state capitalism and state socialism

45:30.480 --> 45:36.080
which might have come to fruition had Anthony and Cleopatra been victorious.

45:36.080 --> 45:39.920
So in that war, if the central planning of Egypt had spread to Rome

45:39.920 --> 45:42.800
it would have been a disaster and it didn't spread the other way

45:42.800 --> 45:48.400
because Egypt was like the basket case for the Roman crane.

45:48.400 --> 45:54.080
So first off, as we know by now, the importation of post-industrial revolution ideas

45:54.080 --> 45:59.600
like socialism and capitalism into the ancient world is misleading and annoying.

45:59.600 --> 46:02.480
But let's check out this Oertle guy.

46:02.480 --> 46:06.640
So Stefan is quoting here from a Cato Institute article called

46:06.640 --> 46:10.000
How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome.

46:10.000 --> 46:15.520
And a more cynical man than me might suspect that an article by a libertarian think tank

46:15.520 --> 46:21.040
talking about the evils of excessive government might just be a tiny bit biased.

46:21.040 --> 46:28.000
But far-fetched speculation aside, the article includes two sources for its quotes by Oertle

46:28.000 --> 46:32.640
and that's chapter 10 and chapter 12 of the Cambridge Ancient History

46:32.640 --> 46:36.160
published in 1934 and 1939.

46:36.160 --> 46:39.600
And when I saw that I thought, oh, that's quite a long time ago.

46:39.600 --> 46:43.840
I wonder if there are any more recent editions of those books

46:43.920 --> 46:46.880
and would you believe it, yes there are.

46:46.880 --> 46:52.240
But I just want to detour a little before we get to those and mention Michael Rostovzef

46:53.440 --> 46:54.880
better said that wrong

46:54.880 --> 46:59.840
who is another historian quoted by both the Cato Institute and Stefan.

46:59.840 --> 47:04.640
And he's someone else who compared his contemporary political situation to ancient Rome

47:04.640 --> 47:08.240
and funnily enough whose Wikipedia article says

47:08.240 --> 47:13.760
Rostovzef used terms such as proletariat, bourgeoisie and capitalism freely in his work

47:13.760 --> 47:17.520
and the importation of those terms into a description of the ancient world

47:17.520 --> 47:21.360
where they did not necessarily apply caused criticism.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.360
So then, do you have those two names?

47:23.920 --> 47:29.280
Right, so let's look at the updated version of Cambridge Ancient History.

47:29.280 --> 47:35.840
And firstly, the newer edition of volume 10 published in 1996 says

47:35.840 --> 47:38.960
It is probably true that there is no period in Roman history

47:38.960 --> 47:44.320
on which the views of modern scholars have been more radically transformed in the last six decades.

47:44.320 --> 47:49.840
It's therefore appropriate to indicate briefly in what respects this volume differs most significantly,

47:50.480 --> 47:51.200
etc.

47:51.760 --> 47:55.280
You get the point, the volume has been heavily revised.

47:55.280 --> 47:59.200
And it goes on to outline the reasons for the changes in perspective

47:59.200 --> 48:01.040
and then the revisions themselves.

48:01.680 --> 48:06.960
And one of these revisions was to just drop Oertl's contribution entirely,

48:06.960 --> 48:12.160
saying basically that it was interesting in its day but it no longer holds up.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.880
Now then, the new edition of volume 12.

48:14.880 --> 48:19.760
And this volume is openly critical of both Rostovzef and Oertl's tactic

48:19.760 --> 48:23.200
of comparing contemporary politics to the ancient world.

48:23.200 --> 48:28.320
And here's a quote taken from the introduction to the section where it first mentions Oertl.

48:28.320 --> 48:31.760
In a rather loose way, modern bourgeois ideology-

48:31.760 --> 48:32.800
Bourgeois?

48:32.800 --> 48:34.720
Bourgeois, I can never say that.

48:34.720 --> 48:40.480
ideology has thought it possible to identify the present-day bourgeoisie with the curiales

48:40.480 --> 48:46.400
and has taken up their cause against the despotism of a totalitarian imperial state.

48:46.400 --> 48:51.840
This is a singularly anachronistic projection of contemporary realities.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.440
So what's my point here?

48:53.440 --> 48:59.600
Well, the Cato Institute and by proxy Stefan are selectively quoting older editions

48:59.600 --> 49:03.600
of the Cambridge ancient history from the 1930s

49:03.600 --> 49:08.400
and ignoring the more recent editions that take a contrary and critical view

49:08.400 --> 49:10.240
of those earlier editions.

49:10.240 --> 49:13.440
But hey, I guess if you want to stop the wheel of history,

49:13.440 --> 49:16.320
you also have to stop historical research.

49:16.880 --> 49:20.800
Let's look at one of the times that Rostovzef shows up in Stefan's video.

49:20.800 --> 49:25.280
And I'm going to show you two clips now, both concerning historian Edward Gibbon.

49:27.440 --> 49:31.760
Gibbon, one of the famous historians who really knew the history of Rome and, you know,

49:31.760 --> 49:36.800
turned his hands into arthritic claws writing all this stuff out.

49:36.800 --> 49:40.880
He wrote once, he said that if a person were to pick the one period

49:40.880 --> 49:45.280
in the history of the human race when mankind was happiest, he would, without hesitation,

49:46.160 --> 49:51.360
choose that period of the second century AD when Rome was stable, when peace reigned

49:51.360 --> 49:53.280
and trade reigned throughout the empire.

49:53.280 --> 49:56.080
Trade was constantly rising and falling as empires rose and fall.

49:56.800 --> 50:01.280
And that is really, really astonishing to think about.

50:01.280 --> 50:05.600
Michael Rostovzef has described this as a period of quote,

50:05.600 --> 50:11.520
almost complete freedom for trade and of splendid opportunities for private initiative.

50:11.520 --> 50:14.800
And this is one of the reasons why, earlier Gibbon said,

50:14.800 --> 50:17.680
this was some of the best places to live ever.

50:18.320 --> 50:21.120
Two days a year, pay your taxes, five percent on customs duties,

50:21.120 --> 50:22.400
which means locally produced goods.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.800
There's no tax, no duties, no nothing at all.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.960
And it's just astounding.

50:26.960 --> 50:30.880
So firstly, this quote of Rostovzef is specifically talking about

50:30.880 --> 50:34.000
the reign of Augustus and his immediate successors.

50:34.560 --> 50:39.760
The time Gibbon identified as the best time to live was under the reign of the so-called

50:39.760 --> 50:43.440
Five Good Emperors, which was a century later.

50:43.440 --> 50:46.000
So let's read Gibbon's actual quote.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.760
If a man were called to fix the period in the history of the world

50:49.760 --> 50:54.480
during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous,

50:54.480 --> 50:56.640
he would, without hesitation,

50:56.640 --> 51:01.440
name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus.

51:01.440 --> 51:06.160
The vast extent of the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power

51:06.160 --> 51:09.360
under the guidance of virtue and wisdom.

51:09.360 --> 51:14.560
And he goes on to mention the civil administration and the laws and the relative peace.

51:14.560 --> 51:20.240
Nowhere here does Gibbon say anything about free trade or the economy or anything.

51:20.240 --> 51:25.040
But he does mention the absolute power wielded by the state as a positive,

51:25.600 --> 51:29.680
which I wouldn't think Stefan would be too keen on, to be perfectly honest.

51:29.680 --> 51:33.760
So I'd like to wrap up my video by responding to a few key moments

51:33.760 --> 51:36.080
from Stefan's conclusion to his video.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.600
And the last thing that I want to say is that

51:41.600 --> 51:42.320
people complain.

51:42.320 --> 51:43.280
I mentioned this at the beginning.

51:43.280 --> 51:44.000
People complain.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.160
They say, well, nobody learns anything from history.

51:46.160 --> 51:48.800
Well, it's like because nobody tells the truth about history.

51:48.800 --> 51:54.080
So what has happened is the history of the West in particular,

51:55.440 --> 51:58.160
the glories, the triumphs and the disasters,

51:58.160 --> 52:01.280
the full span of the Shakespearean span of Western history

52:01.280 --> 52:05.040
has been replaced by vituperative calumny and nagging.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.480
Your ancestors were bad.

52:06.480 --> 52:07.680
Your ancestors were mean.

52:07.680 --> 52:08.320
They were sexist.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.040
They were patriarchs.

52:09.040 --> 52:09.600
They were racist.

52:09.600 --> 52:10.320
They were homophobes.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.840
They were bad, bad, bad.

52:11.840 --> 52:14.080
Colonialism was just terrible, terrible, terrible.

52:14.080 --> 52:15.920
They slaughtered all the natives and all, right?

52:17.040 --> 52:22.800
The truth is that the West has bought by far the greatest values to the world.

52:22.800 --> 52:25.600
The values of science, the values of reason, the values of the free market,

52:25.600 --> 52:27.680
the values of modern medicine, the values of capitalism.

52:27.680 --> 52:35.680
You are the offspring and the descendants of many heroes,

52:36.560 --> 52:42.160
of many brave souls who fought very hard to bring and extend the freedoms you now enjoy.

52:44.320 --> 52:48.480
If you feel that you are descended from evil,

52:49.840 --> 52:52.960
you have nothing in your civilization to defend.

52:52.960 --> 53:06.080
You are children of heroes and only heroes get to keep their freedoms.

53:06.080 --> 53:08.160
Oh, Stefan.

53:10.560 --> 53:15.360
So included there is Stefan saying that nobody tells the truth about history,

53:15.360 --> 53:19.520
but what is the truth about history according to him?

53:19.520 --> 53:25.520
Truth for Molyneux appears to be whatever historical facts conform to his narrative,

53:25.520 --> 53:28.400
and everything else is just, to quote him,

53:28.400 --> 53:32.160
interminable engagement in intellectual debate.

53:32.160 --> 53:36.640
Stefan also says that unless you think you're descended from heroes,

53:36.640 --> 53:40.320
you have nothing to defend about your civilization.

53:40.320 --> 53:41.600
And that's just not true.

53:41.600 --> 53:44.320
I don't think I'm descended from heroes,

53:44.320 --> 53:48.320
and I'll fully admit all the horrible things my society's done in the past,

53:48.320 --> 53:51.520
but I'm still proud of things about my society.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.520
You know, specifically here,

53:53.520 --> 53:58.800
that I have the freedom to admit that my society's done those awful things.

53:58.800 --> 54:03.600
The things I want to defend about my society are all the things that Stefan Molyneux

54:03.600 --> 54:06.080
would take away if he had the chance.

54:06.080 --> 54:11.920
You know, the fall of western civilization for me would be the reinstitution of slavery,

54:11.920 --> 54:15.600
the taken away of women's rights, and things like that.

54:15.600 --> 54:18.320
I don't like this ultra-nationalist idea

54:18.320 --> 54:22.960
where you have to ignore all the bad things your culture or race has ever done.

54:22.960 --> 54:27.440
You know, what does Stefan think happened to the Native American societies?

54:28.240 --> 54:32.000
I don't know, I guess their taxes must have been too high or something.

54:32.960 --> 54:33.840
Oh, god.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.640
No, I'm not doing it.

54:36.640 --> 54:37.840
I'm not watching it.

54:37.840 --> 54:42.560
I'm all Molyneuxed out for a good six months, at least.

54:42.560 --> 54:45.360
If you enjoyed this interminable intellectual debate,

54:45.920 --> 54:47.040
please like and subscribe.

54:47.600 --> 54:49.280
I know what they do now, I think.

54:50.160 --> 54:53.680
I've also got a donation link on the YouTube banner there,

54:53.680 --> 54:55.920
if you're feeling particularly generous,

54:55.920 --> 54:59.360
and I've had quite a few donations of some very lovely people

54:59.360 --> 55:01.120
whose names I won't read out,

55:01.120 --> 55:03.600
because I don't know if they want me to, to be honest.

55:03.600 --> 55:07.360
But you know who you are, and you are very much appreciated.

55:07.360 --> 55:10.880
Also, if you'd like me to take a look at any specific video,

55:10.880 --> 55:13.600
hit me up on either Twitter or Ask FM,

55:13.600 --> 55:16.400
and there will be links to those in the description.

55:16.400 --> 55:19.520
And look at me doing the proper YouTuber ending to the video,

55:19.520 --> 55:22.000
rather than just cutting away mid-sentence.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.400
I'm learning.

55:24.400 --> 55:26.960
Next, I have to figure out motion graphics.
