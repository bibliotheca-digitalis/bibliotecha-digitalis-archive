0	5660	Hello, everyone. I'm gonna change it up today, and make a video that isn't absurdly long.
6260	10500	Now, if you've seen the title of this video, you might be thinking, ah, here we go.
10900	14700	Sean and Jen have finally hoisted the all-feminism flag.
15000	21560	They've come out of the feminism closet, and they're about to start spouting feminism all over the place.
21900	23700	And, well, yes and no.
24000	29900	This is a response to Chris Raygun's video, Feminism, Why You Don't Need It.
30300	36100	But before we get into that, I'd like to briefly talk about some of the trouble I have with arguing feminism on the internet.
36400	40300	And I'm gonna describe a scenario that I imagine we've all seen before.
40600	45300	Two people are arguing about feminism online, both using the term feminist.
45600	50100	However, one person is talking about women fighting for equality and equal rights.
50400	56400	You know, from the suffragette movement for voting rights, all the way to the various issues of the modern day.
56800	63400	And the other person is using feminist to mean modern women who are critics and anti-free speech,
63400	68600	and wanna censor media that they don't like, and force everyone to think like they do.
68800	71600	And as a result, the two people talk past one another.
71800	76400	Now, I certainly have my own opinion as to which of those two definitions is closer to reality,
76400	83500	but, you know, that largely doesn't matter when I'm talking to someone who is rather strongly attached to another definition.
83700	90800	Language just isn't good enough for conveying meaning in a lot of cases, but, you know, that's a topic for a smarter person.
91100	96200	And this is why I often open my videos with a bunch of waffle, you know, like now.
96600	101900	Defining terms and trying to make sure everyone's on the same page before we move forward.
102200	104100	So where does Chris Raygun come in?
104100	108300	Well, I picked his video to respond to here because, to his credit,
108300	113000	he seems to have had something close to this in his mind when he was writing his video.
113200	117500	His main argument is that feminism used to be necessary and purposeful,
117500	120700	but having achieved its goal of equal rights for women,
121100	125800	it's now useless and is just aimlessly inventing new reasons to carry on.
126000	129100	And I'd encourage you all here to go and watch his video.
129200	134100	It's not very long, and again, to his credit, it's much less bombastic and insulting
134100	139600	than your average video by a first-person shooter-playing dude talking about feminism on YouTube.
139800	145700	So from now on, I'm gonna assume that everyone watching this video has watched all of Chris Raygun's video.
145900	151700	Okay, so again, in short, feminism was a worthwhile cause before women had equal rights,
151700	155900	but that goal has now been achieved, and now feminism's just an ideology
155900	158600	inventing new reasons to perpetuate itself,
158600	162000	and modern feminists focus on menial things that don't matter,
162000	166200	like the gender pay gap and women's representation in media,
166200	172100	you know, old feminist activism good, new feminist ideology bad.
172300	177900	And so here's my solution to the problem of arguing over differing definitions of the word feminism.
178100	184600	I'm gonna argue against Chris Raygun's position, but using his definition of the word feminism.
184700	190500	I'm gonna play devil's advocate and accept that everything that Chris Raygun said is true.
190600	195600	So okay, the gender pay gap doesn't matter. It's not a valid issue.
195700	201600	Women's representation in media, in films, computer games, and so on, that's pointless.
201600	204400	It doesn't matter. They're not feminist issues.
204600	209500	Now again, I don't really believe these things, but just for the purpose of this video,
209500	211800	we're gonna argue on Chris's terms.
212000	219000	So I'll agree with all of Chris's points, with one exception, and that's that feminism is no longer needed.
219200	222000	Because even using his definitions,
222000	227100	I think there's several ways to argue that feminism is still relevant and necessary.
227200	228400	And here's the first.
228600	236000	At no point in his video does Chris Raygun specify that he is exclusively talking about any one location.
236300	241000	You know, where is feminism no longer necessary, and who no longer needs it?
241500	246700	There are plenty of countries in which women still do not have equal rights and legal protections,
246700	251500	and in which the oppression of women's much more, shall we say, obvious.
252300	254800	Just look at Malala Yousafzai.
255600	256700	Bare said that wrong.
257400	261400	Getting shot in the head for wanting girls to be able to go to school,
261400	266800	and that's something that we in the West might take for granted, but it was not always the case.
267100	271000	Now, I doubt very much that Chris would say to someone like Malala,
271000	277000	or other girls who are prevented from doing, you know, something as simple as getting an education,
277000	279300	that they don't need feminism.
279400	284600	You know, women's legal equality, even for issues that we think are long settled in the West,
284600	287900	is still a contemporary issue in certain places.
288300	294000	Like, it was less than a year ago that women in Saudi Arabia voted for the first time ever.
294300	296400	And now, of course, I'm being unfair here.
296400	302800	I understand that Chris probably wasn't talking about Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, or places like that.
302800	307300	I imagine he was just talking about the West, and America in particular.
307500	312600	But as far as I know, Chris does not limit his videos to only being viewed in America.
313000	315800	And I know from looking at my own YouTube analytics,
315800	319200	that you occasionally get views from places that you really wouldn't expect.
319500	322900	I've had views from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and the likes.
323100	325000	And Chris has a lot more views than me,
325000	331700	so I imagine he's had even more views from places like that, where women do not have equal rights.
332000	334700	And so this is the first problem with Chris's argument.
334700	339300	It's seemingly from an exclusively Western American perspective.
339600	343700	And so, okay, let's limit ourselves just to talking about the West.
344000	346800	And here's the second problem I have with Chris's argument.
347300	351000	It assumes a linear view of social progressivism.
351400	356300	In Chris's view, women didn't have the vote, and feminism was therefore necessary.
356700	360300	Then women got the vote, and now feminism is not necessary.
360500	362600	And that's the end of that story.
362900	366700	What he's missing is that the current situation is not fixed.
367300	371700	And well, maybe it's unfair to say he missed it, because he does mention this.
372200	376300	feminism is a set of values based on decisions that have already been decided,
376300	379500	and that very few, if any, people are actually contesting.
379900	384400	You know, a small amount of people who disagree with women having equal rights.
384700	386700	And I personally can attest to that.
386700	390100	I've recently been in some pretty shady places on the internet,
390100	393400	filled with dudes who would love to take away women's right to vote.
393700	396900	And you might argue that these people don't have very mainstream views,
396900	400600	and what they want will never happen, but hey, who knows?
400900	406100	Me and Chris grew up during a time of what's largely been social progressivism,
406100	408900	but of course, things can swing the other way.
409300	413100	And that's one more argument for the continuation of feminism, I think.
413300	415700	It's not enough to just win your rights.
415900	419700	As long as there are people out there who would take those rights away from you,
419700	421200	they have to be defended.
421500	424500	And we've thus far been talking about women's right to vote,
424500	427500	and other relatively uncontroversial things like that.
427500	432300	What Chris doesn't mention are any of what we'll call the more borderline cases.
432700	437700	Now, I doubt anyone would argue that reproductive rights are not a feminist issue, and well,
437700	441300	there are people running for the highest office in America right now,
441300	444900	who are saying that they will overturn Roe vs. Wade.
445100	450100	And this isn't ancient history, this is an actual contemporary political reality
450100	455100	that could have real legal ramifications for women who are alive right now.
455300	462100	Chris says that he believes in women's equal rights, but he calls it egalitarianism, not feminism.
462100	466300	And I think the abortion issue is one good argument for the use of the word feminism
466300	472700	in place of something like egalitarianism, because it's an issue that disproportionately affects women.
472700	479500	It would be equality, in one sense, for nobody, male or female, to have access to abortion,
479500	482500	but that wouldn't tell the whole story, would it?
482500	487500	There's a specifically gendered aspect to the issue, and to understand it,
487500	493900	you really need a framework that specifically addresses gender inequalities, like feminism.
494500	498500	Now, I'll admit that I've only watched this one video of Chris Regan's,
498500	500900	but he doesn't seem here to be that bad of a guy.
500900	504900	In fact, he doesn't seem that far off from being a feminist himself,
504900	510500	he's just stuck using what I would deem a very narrow-minded definition of the word.
511100	517500	And, look, we're back to arguing definitions of words again, so it's probably time to wrap up.
517700	522500	Anyway, thanks a lot for watching. I hope you were able to take something from this.
522700	528500	Um, I think I might make a few more shorter videos like this before I get back to the big guys.
528900	535300	And I'd just like to mention and apologize here for my awful, terrible devil's advocacy, you know.
535300	539700	Being a straight white guy and, you know, relatively sheltered from a lot of issues
539700	545500	does give one a somewhat detached and dispassionate perspective and, you know,
545500	550300	the ability to pretend to hold views that one doesn't, for the sake of argument,
550700	556900	in a way that I understand can be quite annoying to people who are more affected by the actual issues.
557300	560100	Um, what am I saying?
560700	567900	Uh, there's nothing inherently rational or intelligent about being detached and unemotional.
567900	568700	Okay.
569500	575300	Uh, someone more articulate than me, please explain what I'm trying to say in the comments.
575700	578700	Okay, like, subscribe, all that jazz.
579100	579900	See ya.
580300	582300	Thanks for watching!
