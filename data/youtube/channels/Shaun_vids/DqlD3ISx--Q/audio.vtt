00:00.000 --> 00:05.660
Hello, everyone. I'm gonna change it up today, and make a video that isn't absurdly long.

00:06.260 --> 00:10.500
Now, if you've seen the title of this video, you might be thinking, ah, here we go.

00:10.900 --> 00:14.700
Sean and Jen have finally hoisted the all-feminism flag.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.560
They've come out of the feminism closet, and they're about to start spouting feminism all over the place.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.700
And, well, yes and no.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.900
This is a response to Chris Raygun's video, Feminism, Why You Don't Need It.

00:30.300 --> 00:36.100
But before we get into that, I'd like to briefly talk about some of the trouble I have with arguing feminism on the internet.

00:36.400 --> 00:40.300
And I'm gonna describe a scenario that I imagine we've all seen before.

00:40.600 --> 00:45.300
Two people are arguing about feminism online, both using the term feminist.

00:45.600 --> 00:50.100
However, one person is talking about women fighting for equality and equal rights.

00:50.400 --> 00:56.400
You know, from the suffragette movement for voting rights, all the way to the various issues of the modern day.

00:56.800 --> 01:03.400
And the other person is using feminist to mean modern women who are critics and anti-free speech,

01:03.400 --> 01:08.600
and wanna censor media that they don't like, and force everyone to think like they do.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.600
And as a result, the two people talk past one another.

01:11.800 --> 01:16.400
Now, I certainly have my own opinion as to which of those two definitions is closer to reality,

01:16.400 --> 01:23.500
but, you know, that largely doesn't matter when I'm talking to someone who is rather strongly attached to another definition.

01:23.700 --> 01:30.800
Language just isn't good enough for conveying meaning in a lot of cases, but, you know, that's a topic for a smarter person.

01:31.100 --> 01:36.200
And this is why I often open my videos with a bunch of waffle, you know, like now.

01:36.600 --> 01:41.900
Defining terms and trying to make sure everyone's on the same page before we move forward.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.100
So where does Chris Raygun come in?

01:44.100 --> 01:48.300
Well, I picked his video to respond to here because, to his credit,

01:48.300 --> 01:53.000
he seems to have had something close to this in his mind when he was writing his video.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.500
His main argument is that feminism used to be necessary and purposeful,

01:57.500 --> 02:00.700
but having achieved its goal of equal rights for women,

02:01.100 --> 02:05.800
it's now useless and is just aimlessly inventing new reasons to carry on.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.100
And I'd encourage you all here to go and watch his video.

02:09.200 --> 02:14.100
It's not very long, and again, to his credit, it's much less bombastic and insulting

02:14.100 --> 02:19.600
than your average video by a first-person shooter-playing dude talking about feminism on YouTube.

02:19.800 --> 02:25.700
So from now on, I'm gonna assume that everyone watching this video has watched all of Chris Raygun's video.

02:25.900 --> 02:31.700
Okay, so again, in short, feminism was a worthwhile cause before women had equal rights,

02:31.700 --> 02:35.900
but that goal has now been achieved, and now feminism's just an ideology

02:35.900 --> 02:38.600
inventing new reasons to perpetuate itself,

02:38.600 --> 02:42.000
and modern feminists focus on menial things that don't matter,

02:42.000 --> 02:46.200
like the gender pay gap and women's representation in media,

02:46.200 --> 02:52.100
you know, old feminist activism good, new feminist ideology bad.

02:52.300 --> 02:57.900
And so here's my solution to the problem of arguing over differing definitions of the word feminism.

02:58.100 --> 03:04.600
I'm gonna argue against Chris Raygun's position, but using his definition of the word feminism.

03:04.700 --> 03:10.500
I'm gonna play devil's advocate and accept that everything that Chris Raygun said is true.

03:10.600 --> 03:15.600
So okay, the gender pay gap doesn't matter. It's not a valid issue.

03:15.700 --> 03:21.600
Women's representation in media, in films, computer games, and so on, that's pointless.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.400
It doesn't matter. They're not feminist issues.

03:24.600 --> 03:29.500
Now again, I don't really believe these things, but just for the purpose of this video,

03:29.500 --> 03:31.800
we're gonna argue on Chris's terms.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
So I'll agree with all of Chris's points, with one exception, and that's that feminism is no longer needed.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.000
Because even using his definitions,

03:42.000 --> 03:47.100
I think there's several ways to argue that feminism is still relevant and necessary.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.400
And here's the first.

03:48.600 --> 03:56.000
At no point in his video does Chris Raygun specify that he is exclusively talking about any one location.

03:56.300 --> 04:01.000
You know, where is feminism no longer necessary, and who no longer needs it?

04:01.500 --> 04:06.700
There are plenty of countries in which women still do not have equal rights and legal protections,

04:06.700 --> 04:11.500
and in which the oppression of women's much more, shall we say, obvious.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.800
Just look at Malala Yousafzai.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.700
Bare said that wrong.

04:17.400 --> 04:21.400
Getting shot in the head for wanting girls to be able to go to school,

04:21.400 --> 04:26.800
and that's something that we in the West might take for granted, but it was not always the case.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.000
Now, I doubt very much that Chris would say to someone like Malala,

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
or other girls who are prevented from doing, you know, something as simple as getting an education,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.300
that they don't need feminism.

04:39.400 --> 04:44.600
You know, women's legal equality, even for issues that we think are long settled in the West,

04:44.600 --> 04:47.900
is still a contemporary issue in certain places.

04:48.300 --> 04:54.000
Like, it was less than a year ago that women in Saudi Arabia voted for the first time ever.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.400
And now, of course, I'm being unfair here.

04:56.400 --> 05:02.800
I understand that Chris probably wasn't talking about Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, or places like that.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.300
I imagine he was just talking about the West, and America in particular.

05:07.500 --> 05:12.600
But as far as I know, Chris does not limit his videos to only being viewed in America.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.800
And I know from looking at my own YouTube analytics,

05:15.800 --> 05:19.200
that you occasionally get views from places that you really wouldn't expect.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.900
I've had views from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and the likes.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.000
And Chris has a lot more views than me,

05:25.000 --> 05:31.700
so I imagine he's had even more views from places like that, where women do not have equal rights.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.700
And so this is the first problem with Chris's argument.

05:34.700 --> 05:39.300
It's seemingly from an exclusively Western American perspective.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.700
And so, okay, let's limit ourselves just to talking about the West.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.800
And here's the second problem I have with Chris's argument.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.000
It assumes a linear view of social progressivism.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.300
In Chris's view, women didn't have the vote, and feminism was therefore necessary.

05:56.700 --> 06:00.300
Then women got the vote, and now feminism is not necessary.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.600
And that's the end of that story.

06:02.900 --> 06:06.700
What he's missing is that the current situation is not fixed.

06:07.300 --> 06:11.700
And well, maybe it's unfair to say he missed it, because he does mention this.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.300
feminism is a set of values based on decisions that have already been decided,

06:16.300 --> 06:19.500
and that very few, if any, people are actually contesting.

06:19.900 --> 06:24.400
You know, a small amount of people who disagree with women having equal rights.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.700
And I personally can attest to that.

06:26.700 --> 06:30.100
I've recently been in some pretty shady places on the internet,

06:30.100 --> 06:33.400
filled with dudes who would love to take away women's right to vote.

06:33.700 --> 06:36.900
And you might argue that these people don't have very mainstream views,

06:36.900 --> 06:40.600
and what they want will never happen, but hey, who knows?

06:40.900 --> 06:46.100
Me and Chris grew up during a time of what's largely been social progressivism,

06:46.100 --> 06:48.900
but of course, things can swing the other way.

06:49.300 --> 06:53.100
And that's one more argument for the continuation of feminism, I think.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.700
It's not enough to just win your rights.

06:55.900 --> 06:59.700
As long as there are people out there who would take those rights away from you,

06:59.700 --> 07:01.200
they have to be defended.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.500
And we've thus far been talking about women's right to vote,

07:04.500 --> 07:07.500
and other relatively uncontroversial things like that.

07:07.500 --> 07:12.300
What Chris doesn't mention are any of what we'll call the more borderline cases.

07:12.700 --> 07:17.700
Now, I doubt anyone would argue that reproductive rights are not a feminist issue, and well,

07:17.700 --> 07:21.300
there are people running for the highest office in America right now,

07:21.300 --> 07:24.900
who are saying that they will overturn Roe vs. Wade.

07:25.100 --> 07:30.100
And this isn't ancient history, this is an actual contemporary political reality

07:30.100 --> 07:35.100
that could have real legal ramifications for women who are alive right now.

07:35.300 --> 07:42.100
Chris says that he believes in women's equal rights, but he calls it egalitarianism, not feminism.

07:42.100 --> 07:46.300
And I think the abortion issue is one good argument for the use of the word feminism

07:46.300 --> 07:52.700
in place of something like egalitarianism, because it's an issue that disproportionately affects women.

07:52.700 --> 07:59.500
It would be equality, in one sense, for nobody, male or female, to have access to abortion,

07:59.500 --> 08:02.500
but that wouldn't tell the whole story, would it?

08:02.500 --> 08:07.500
There's a specifically gendered aspect to the issue, and to understand it,

08:07.500 --> 08:13.900
you really need a framework that specifically addresses gender inequalities, like feminism.

08:14.500 --> 08:18.500
Now, I'll admit that I've only watched this one video of Chris Regan's,

08:18.500 --> 08:20.900
but he doesn't seem here to be that bad of a guy.

08:20.900 --> 08:24.900
In fact, he doesn't seem that far off from being a feminist himself,

08:24.900 --> 08:30.500
he's just stuck using what I would deem a very narrow-minded definition of the word.

08:31.100 --> 08:37.500
And, look, we're back to arguing definitions of words again, so it's probably time to wrap up.

08:37.700 --> 08:42.500
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching. I hope you were able to take something from this.

08:42.700 --> 08:48.500
Um, I think I might make a few more shorter videos like this before I get back to the big guys.

08:48.900 --> 08:55.300
And I'd just like to mention and apologize here for my awful, terrible devil's advocacy, you know.

08:55.300 --> 08:59.700
Being a straight white guy and, you know, relatively sheltered from a lot of issues

08:59.700 --> 09:05.500
does give one a somewhat detached and dispassionate perspective and, you know,

09:05.500 --> 09:10.300
the ability to pretend to hold views that one doesn't, for the sake of argument,

09:10.700 --> 09:16.900
in a way that I understand can be quite annoying to people who are more affected by the actual issues.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.100
Um, what am I saying?

09:20.700 --> 09:27.900
Uh, there's nothing inherently rational or intelligent about being detached and unemotional.

09:27.900 --> 09:28.700
Okay.

09:29.500 --> 09:35.300
Uh, someone more articulate than me, please explain what I'm trying to say in the comments.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.700
Okay, like, subscribe, all that jazz.

09:39.100 --> 09:39.900
See ya.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.300
Thanks for watching!
