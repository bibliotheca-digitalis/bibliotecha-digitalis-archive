00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
Hello, everyone. I'm gonna change it up today, and make a video that isn't absurdly long.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,500
Now, if you've seen the title of this video, you might be thinking, ah, here we go.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,700
Sean and Jen have finally hoisted the all-feminism flag.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,560
They've come out of the feminism closet, and they're about to start spouting feminism all over the place.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,700
And, well, yes and no.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,900
This is a response to Chris Raygun's video, Feminism, Why You Don't Need It.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,100
But before we get into that, I'd like to briefly talk about some of the trouble I have with arguing feminism on the internet.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,300
And I'm gonna describe a scenario that I imagine we've all seen before.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,300
Two people are arguing about feminism online, both using the term feminist.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,100
However, one person is talking about women fighting for equality and equal rights.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,400
You know, from the suffragette movement for voting rights, all the way to the various issues of the modern day.

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,400
And the other person is using feminist to mean modern women who are critics and anti-free speech,

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,600
and wanna censor media that they don't like, and force everyone to think like they do.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
And as a result, the two people talk past one another.

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,400
Now, I certainly have my own opinion as to which of those two definitions is closer to reality,

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,500
but, you know, that largely doesn't matter when I'm talking to someone who is rather strongly attached to another definition.

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,800
Language just isn't good enough for conveying meaning in a lot of cases, but, you know, that's a topic for a smarter person.

18
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,200
And this is why I often open my videos with a bunch of waffle, you know, like now.

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,900
Defining terms and trying to make sure everyone's on the same page before we move forward.

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,100
So where does Chris Raygun come in?

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,300
Well, I picked his video to respond to here because, to his credit,

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,000
he seems to have had something close to this in his mind when he was writing his video.

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,500
His main argument is that feminism used to be necessary and purposeful,

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,700
but having achieved its goal of equal rights for women,

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,800
it's now useless and is just aimlessly inventing new reasons to carry on.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,100
And I'd encourage you all here to go and watch his video.

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,100
It's not very long, and again, to his credit, it's much less bombastic and insulting

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,600
than your average video by a first-person shooter-playing dude talking about feminism on YouTube.

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,700
So from now on, I'm gonna assume that everyone watching this video has watched all of Chris Raygun's video.

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,700
Okay, so again, in short, feminism was a worthwhile cause before women had equal rights,

31
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,900
but that goal has now been achieved, and now feminism's just an ideology

32
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,600
inventing new reasons to perpetuate itself,

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,000
and modern feminists focus on menial things that don't matter,

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,200
like the gender pay gap and women's representation in media,

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,100
you know, old feminist activism good, new feminist ideology bad.

36
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,900
And so here's my solution to the problem of arguing over differing definitions of the word feminism.

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm gonna argue against Chris Raygun's position, but using his definition of the word feminism.

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,500
I'm gonna play devil's advocate and accept that everything that Chris Raygun said is true.

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,600
So okay, the gender pay gap doesn't matter. It's not a valid issue.

40
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,600
Women's representation in media, in films, computer games, and so on, that's pointless.

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,400
It doesn't matter. They're not feminist issues.

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,500
Now again, I don't really believe these things, but just for the purpose of this video,

43
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,800
we're gonna argue on Chris's terms.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So I'll agree with all of Chris's points, with one exception, and that's that feminism is no longer needed.

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Because even using his definitions,

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,100
I think there's several ways to argue that feminism is still relevant and necessary.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
And here's the first.

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:56,000
At no point in his video does Chris Raygun specify that he is exclusively talking about any one location.

49
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,000
You know, where is feminism no longer necessary, and who no longer needs it?

50
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,700
There are plenty of countries in which women still do not have equal rights and legal protections,

51
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,500
and in which the oppression of women's much more, shall we say, obvious.

52
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,800
Just look at Malala Yousafzai.

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,700
Bare said that wrong.

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Getting shot in the head for wanting girls to be able to go to school,

55
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,800
and that's something that we in the West might take for granted, but it was not always the case.

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,000
Now, I doubt very much that Chris would say to someone like Malala,

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
or other girls who are prevented from doing, you know, something as simple as getting an education,

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,300
that they don't need feminism.

59
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,600
You know, women's legal equality, even for issues that we think are long settled in the West,

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,900
is still a contemporary issue in certain places.

61
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,000
Like, it was less than a year ago that women in Saudi Arabia voted for the first time ever.

62
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,400
And now, of course, I'm being unfair here.

63
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,800
I understand that Chris probably wasn't talking about Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, or places like that.

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,300
I imagine he was just talking about the West, and America in particular.

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,600
But as far as I know, Chris does not limit his videos to only being viewed in America.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
And I know from looking at my own YouTube analytics,

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,200
that you occasionally get views from places that you really wouldn't expect.

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,900
I've had views from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and the likes.

69
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,000
And Chris has a lot more views than me,

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,700
so I imagine he's had even more views from places like that, where women do not have equal rights.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,700
And so this is the first problem with Chris's argument.

72
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,300
It's seemingly from an exclusively Western American perspective.

73
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,700
And so, okay, let's limit ourselves just to talking about the West.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
And here's the second problem I have with Chris's argument.

75
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,000
It assumes a linear view of social progressivism.

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,300
In Chris's view, women didn't have the vote, and feminism was therefore necessary.

77
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,300
Then women got the vote, and now feminism is not necessary.

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,600
And that's the end of that story.

79
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,700
What he's missing is that the current situation is not fixed.

80
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,700
And well, maybe it's unfair to say he missed it, because he does mention this.

81
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,300
feminism is a set of values based on decisions that have already been decided,

82
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,500
and that very few, if any, people are actually contesting.

83
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,400
You know, a small amount of people who disagree with women having equal rights.

84
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,700
And I personally can attest to that.

85
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,100
I've recently been in some pretty shady places on the internet,

86
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,400
filled with dudes who would love to take away women's right to vote.

87
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,900
And you might argue that these people don't have very mainstream views,

88
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,600
and what they want will never happen, but hey, who knows?

89
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,100
Me and Chris grew up during a time of what's largely been social progressivism,

90
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,900
but of course, things can swing the other way.

91
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,100
And that's one more argument for the continuation of feminism, I think.

92
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,700
It's not enough to just win your rights.

93
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,700
As long as there are people out there who would take those rights away from you,

94
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,200
they have to be defended.

95
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
And we've thus far been talking about women's right to vote,

96
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
and other relatively uncontroversial things like that.

97
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,300
What Chris doesn't mention are any of what we'll call the more borderline cases.

98
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Now, I doubt anyone would argue that reproductive rights are not a feminist issue, and well,

99
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,300
there are people running for the highest office in America right now,

100
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,900
who are saying that they will overturn Roe vs. Wade.

101
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,100
And this isn't ancient history, this is an actual contemporary political reality

102
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,100
that could have real legal ramifications for women who are alive right now.

103
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:42,100
Chris says that he believes in women's equal rights, but he calls it egalitarianism, not feminism.

104
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,300
And I think the abortion issue is one good argument for the use of the word feminism

105
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,700
in place of something like egalitarianism, because it's an issue that disproportionately affects women.

106
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:59,500
It would be equality, in one sense, for nobody, male or female, to have access to abortion,

107
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
but that wouldn't tell the whole story, would it?

108
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,500
There's a specifically gendered aspect to the issue, and to understand it,

109
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,900
you really need a framework that specifically addresses gender inequalities, like feminism.

110
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Now, I'll admit that I've only watched this one video of Chris Regan's,

111
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,900
but he doesn't seem here to be that bad of a guy.

112
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,900
In fact, he doesn't seem that far off from being a feminist himself,

113
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,500
he's just stuck using what I would deem a very narrow-minded definition of the word.

114
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:37,500
And, look, we're back to arguing definitions of words again, so it's probably time to wrap up.

115
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,500
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching. I hope you were able to take something from this.

116
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,500
Um, I think I might make a few more shorter videos like this before I get back to the big guys.

117
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:55,300
And I'd just like to mention and apologize here for my awful, terrible devil's advocacy, you know.

118
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,700
Being a straight white guy and, you know, relatively sheltered from a lot of issues

119
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,500
does give one a somewhat detached and dispassionate perspective and, you know,

120
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,300
the ability to pretend to hold views that one doesn't, for the sake of argument,

121
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,900
in a way that I understand can be quite annoying to people who are more affected by the actual issues.

122
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,100
Um, what am I saying?

123
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,900
Uh, there's nothing inherently rational or intelligent about being detached and unemotional.

124
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,700
Okay.

125
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,300
Uh, someone more articulate than me, please explain what I'm trying to say in the comments.

126
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,700
Okay, like, subscribe, all that jazz.

127
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,900
See ya.

128
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Thanks for watching!
