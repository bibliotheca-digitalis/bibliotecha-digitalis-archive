00:00.000 --> 00:01.440
Hello, everyone.

00:01.440 --> 00:07.680
Today, we're going to be talking about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.680
And let's start today by telling a story.

00:10.680 --> 00:17.560
So, at the conclusion to the Second World War, Japan, though their military forces had been soundly defeated,

00:17.560 --> 00:21.440
stubbornly refused to negotiate an end to the conflict.

00:21.440 --> 00:26.920
Their militaristic leaders had committed to total war in defense of the Japanese Empire,

00:26.960 --> 00:32.880
and were prepared to mobilize Japanese civilians to combat any potential American invasion.

00:32.880 --> 00:37.760
President Harry Truman and his advisors were therefore faced with a difficult choice.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.360
Either they could commit to a long and costly invasion of Japan,

00:41.360 --> 00:44.440
which they estimated would kill more than a million people,

00:44.440 --> 00:48.560
or they could use their secret weapon, the world's first nuclear bombs,

00:48.560 --> 00:51.560
which the United States had recently constructed.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.480
So, in order to shorten the war and avoid the need for an invasion,

00:55.480 --> 01:02.600
Truman decided to drop two bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, two major military and industrial targets.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.440
Demonstrating the extent of the Japanese military's desire to keep fighting, however,

01:07.440 --> 01:11.560
even after these bombs were dropped, Japan's Supreme Council remained deadlocked,

01:11.560 --> 01:16.360
with some military leaders still refusing to consider negotiating a peace.

01:16.360 --> 01:21.880
It took the unprecedented intervention of Emperor Hirohito to break the impasse in the council,

01:21.880 --> 01:24.640
and finally convinced the military to stand down,

01:24.640 --> 01:26.640
bringing an end to the war.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.880
So, that's quite a simple story there.

01:29.880 --> 01:36.560
And presented like this, dropping the nuclear bombs was pretty unambiguously the right and moral thing to do,

01:36.560 --> 01:39.560
when compared to the worse alternative, anyway.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.200
What this is is a basic trolley problem.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.440
You might not like dropping the nuclear bombs,

01:44.440 --> 01:48.360
but if the only other option on the table is a long, costly invasion

01:48.360 --> 01:51.480
that is definitely going to kill and injure even more people,

01:51.480 --> 01:53.480
then the bombs become acceptable.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.480
And justifiable.

01:55.480 --> 02:01.280
And this is a popular and enduring perception of the events that led to the nuclear bombs being dropped,

02:01.280 --> 02:06.720
that they were used specifically to force Japan to surrender, without the need for an invasion.

02:06.720 --> 02:11.320
However, this is Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy,

02:11.320 --> 02:16.480
who was the senior-most United States military officer on active duty during World War II,

02:16.480 --> 02:21.920
and the personal chief of staff to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.640
And after the war, with regards to the nuclear bombs, Leahy wrote the following.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.880
It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki

02:30.880 --> 02:34.280
was of no material assistance in our war against Japan.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.320
The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender

02:37.320 --> 02:41.280
because of the effect of sea blockade and bombing with conventional weapons.

02:41.280 --> 02:47.400
Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, who was commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet during World War II,

02:47.400 --> 02:51.360
said, at a speech given on October 5th, 1945,

02:51.440 --> 02:57.280
the Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace before the atomic age was announced to the world

02:57.280 --> 03:01.520
with the destruction of Hiroshima, and before the Russian entry into the war.

03:01.520 --> 03:08.320
The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military standpoint, in the defeat of Japan.

03:08.320 --> 03:14.280
And this is General Dwight Eisenhower, who was supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe

03:14.280 --> 03:17.760
during World War II, and later President of the United States.

03:17.760 --> 03:22.160
And his opinion of the atomic bomb was that the Japanese were ready to surrender,

03:22.160 --> 03:25.840
and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing.

03:25.840 --> 03:32.160
And Eisenhower later wrote in his memoirs about a conversation he had with War Secretary Henry Stimson,

03:32.160 --> 03:33.440
in which he states,

03:47.760 --> 03:58.080
It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender.

03:58.080 --> 04:04.000
And in 1944, President Roosevelt directed Henry Stimson to put together a survey team

04:04.000 --> 04:08.800
to write a report on the effectiveness of the Allied aerial bombing tactics during the war.

04:08.800 --> 04:14.960
Published in 1946, this strategic bombing survey came to the conclusion that Japan would have surrendered

04:14.960 --> 04:19.840
even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war,

04:19.840 --> 04:23.440
and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.880
So, what's going on here, then?

04:26.880 --> 04:30.480
The people I just quoted there were all involved in the Second World War

04:30.480 --> 04:34.240
in important positions of political and military power.

04:34.240 --> 04:38.560
And instead of viewing the bombs as a necessary lesser-of-two-evils,

04:38.560 --> 04:44.560
they instead see them as everything from simply militarily unnecessary to a grave moral crime.

04:44.960 --> 04:49.600
Now, obviously, if these people are correct that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

04:49.600 --> 04:51.760
were not necessary to end the war,

04:51.760 --> 04:57.680
then the trolley problem version of the story we told at the start of the video can't be true, can it?

04:57.680 --> 05:00.720
So, this is what we're here to investigate today.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.720
Which of these versions of history is closer to the truth?

05:04.720 --> 05:08.240
We're going to take a look at the closing months of the Second World War

05:08.240 --> 05:10.480
in the lead-up to the atomic bombings.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.040
And I think we should start today by briefly introducing

05:13.040 --> 05:15.680
the various people that we're going to be talking about,

05:15.680 --> 05:17.840
a few of whom we've mentioned already.

05:17.840 --> 05:22.240
So, first off, in the United States, we have President Franklin D. Roosevelt,

05:22.240 --> 05:25.360
who was in office for most of the Second World War.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.720
Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945,

05:28.720 --> 05:32.560
meaning that his vice president, Harry Truman, became president,

05:32.560 --> 05:35.360
and he was in office for the remainder of the war,

05:35.360 --> 05:38.320
including the period when the nuclear bombs were dropped.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.320
Working for Truman, we have Chief of Staff Admiral William D. Leahy,

05:42.320 --> 05:46.320
who was one of the people we just quoted who thought the bombs were unnecessary,

05:46.320 --> 05:48.720
Secretary of War Henry L. Stimpson,

05:48.720 --> 05:52.880
who was the person to whom Eisenhower voiced his misgivings about the bomb,

05:52.880 --> 05:56.080
and Secretary of State James F. Burns.

05:56.080 --> 06:00.640
And, spoiler warning, this man in particular makes a lot of very poor decisions.

06:00.640 --> 06:04.080
Leahy and Stimpson both served in the same roles under Roosevelt,

06:04.080 --> 06:10.400
but James F. Burns was appointed Secretary of State by Harry Truman on July 3, 1945.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.080
The nuclear bombs themselves were constructed by the Manhattan Project,

06:14.080 --> 06:16.720
which was directed by General Leslie Groves,

06:16.720 --> 06:21.680
and the actual laboratory that designed the bombs was headed by J. Robert Oppenheimer.

06:21.680 --> 06:26.640
Over in Japan, at the top of the Japanese government, we have Emperor Hirohito,

06:26.640 --> 06:30.960
and he was advised by the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.800
The Supreme Council had six members, and they, for the most part,

06:34.800 --> 06:38.640
fell into two factions, the Moderates and the Hardliners.

06:38.640 --> 06:42.240
So for the Moderates, we have Prime Minister Kantaro Suzuki,

06:42.240 --> 06:44.960
Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo,

06:44.960 --> 06:47.840
and Minister of the Navy Mitsumasa Yonai.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.080
And for the Hardliners, we have Minister of War Kurechika Anami,

06:52.080 --> 06:55.360
Chief of the Army General Staff Yoshijirō Umezu,

06:55.360 --> 06:58.400
and Chief of the Navy General Staff Soemu Toyoda.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.440
We'll get more into the differences between these groups in a little while,

07:01.440 --> 07:06.240
but generally the Hardliners favored a more hardline military strategy,

07:06.240 --> 07:08.320
and the Moderates were more... moderate.

07:08.880 --> 07:12.000
Also important for us here is Naotake Sato,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.560
the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union,

07:14.560 --> 07:18.960
who was in frequent contact with Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo.

07:18.960 --> 07:22.640
And the messages sent between Togo and Sato are key to understanding

07:22.640 --> 07:25.600
the thinking of the Japanese leadership at the time.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.080
Outside of the US and Japan, we have British Prime Minister Winston Churchill

07:30.080 --> 07:33.280
and Premier of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.520
I don't know if you've ever heard of them.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.320
Now, of course, there were many more people than this

07:38.320 --> 07:40.480
involved in the end of the Second World War,

07:40.480 --> 07:42.960
and I'll be mentioning more people going forward.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.080
This list comprises only the most principal actors

07:46.080 --> 07:49.040
in the particular events that we're going to be talking about today.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.120
As well as people, there's going to be a lot of dates and events to remember here,

07:53.120 --> 07:55.520
so I'm going to be using a calendar going forward

07:55.520 --> 07:57.520
so that we can keep track of everything.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.640
The two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

08:00.640 --> 08:03.520
on the 6th and 9th of August, respectively.

08:03.520 --> 08:07.680
And we've also already mentioned the inauguration of Harry Truman on the 12th of April

08:07.680 --> 08:12.720
and his appointing of James Burns to Secretary of State on the 3rd of July.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.040
As we go through the events leading up to the bombings,

08:15.040 --> 08:19.600
I'll add more to this calendar and highlight which days I'm talking about in particular,

08:19.600 --> 08:22.160
and hopefully this will help us to keep organized.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.000
Before all that, though, there is one important event we need to know about

08:26.000 --> 08:27.840
prior to the Second World War,

08:27.840 --> 08:32.720
and that's the Russo-Japanese War fought between 1904 and 1905.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.040
Now, I won't dwell on this too long,

08:35.040 --> 08:38.480
but the very quick Wikipedia summary goes like this.

08:38.480 --> 08:42.400
The Russo-Japanese War was fought between the Russian and Japanese empires

08:42.400 --> 08:46.240
over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea.

08:46.240 --> 08:50.960
So it's two empires fighting over land and influence in Asia, basically.

08:50.960 --> 08:56.320
Anyway, in this war, Russia suffered a series of humiliating and surprising defeats

08:56.320 --> 09:00.800
at the hands of Japan, a nation that Russia was expecting to beat relatively easily.

09:01.280 --> 09:04.480
Perhaps most notable of these defeats is the Battle of Tsushima,

09:04.480 --> 09:08.320
where virtually a whole Russian fleet was sunk by the Japanese navy

09:08.320 --> 09:10.960
who suffered only minor losses themselves.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.200
Russia was forced to sue for peace,

09:13.200 --> 09:17.520
which was mediated in the United States by President Theodore Roosevelt,

09:17.520 --> 09:21.520
and the resulting treaty saw Russia withdrawing their troops from Manchuria,

09:21.520 --> 09:26.160
recognizing Japan's claim to Korea, as well as ceding a bunch of territory.

09:26.160 --> 09:30.160
All this coupled with the fact that the Japanese Empire had initiated the war

09:30.160 --> 09:33.920
with a surprise attack on the Russian-occupied Port Arthur

09:33.920 --> 09:38.800
meant that the Russians were, to put it lightly, rather ticked off about the whole affair.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.280
The disastrous Russian performance in the war

09:41.280 --> 09:46.480
is considered one of the main instigating factors behind the 1905 Russian Revolution,

09:46.480 --> 09:48.880
but that's a story for another day.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.680
So to summarize and generalize a bit,

09:51.680 --> 09:54.880
Russia held a grudge against Japan for beating them in a war

09:54.880 --> 09:58.480
and denying them influence and territory in Asia.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.920
This is all important in the context of the Yalta Conference,

10:01.920 --> 10:05.760
which took place between the 4th and 11th of February there.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.600
This was a meeting of Stalin, Churchill, and Franklin D. Roosevelt

10:09.600 --> 10:14.320
to discuss, among other things, the post-war reorganization of Europe.

10:14.320 --> 10:18.800
Nazi Germany was on its last legs at this point, its defeat was inevitable.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.680
Adolf Hitler shot himself on the 30th of April,

10:21.680 --> 10:25.520
and the German high command surrendered unconditionally on May the 7th.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.560
And the Yalta Conference was held to discuss and negotiate

10:28.560 --> 10:33.040
the various things that should happen following that upcoming Nazi defeat.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.520
The main focus of the conference was Europe,

10:35.520 --> 10:40.880
but important for us here is that the Soviet Union's entry into the war against Japan was discussed.

10:40.880 --> 10:45.280
Churchill and Roosevelt wanted Stalin to declare war on Japan.

10:45.280 --> 10:49.440
Specifically, they wanted him to invade Japanese-occupied Manchuria,

10:49.440 --> 10:53.840
which would make Japan have to fight on an extra front and spread their resources thinner,

10:53.840 --> 10:56.400
and this would hopefully hasten their defeat.

10:56.400 --> 11:02.400
Now, this was a little bit awkward as Russia and Japan had signed a non-aggression pact in 1941,

11:02.400 --> 11:06.000
and that wasn't due to expire until 1946.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.520
Despite this non-aggression pact, Stalin also wanted Russia to declare war against Japan.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.160
However, he wanted something in return.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.080
So on the 11th of February, the Allies signed a secret protocol

11:18.080 --> 11:20.560
agreeing that Russia would enter the war against Japan,

11:20.960 --> 11:26.320
two or three months after Germany has surrendered and the war in Europe is terminated.

11:26.320 --> 11:30.240
And the price for Russia's doing so was that the former rights of Russia

11:30.240 --> 11:35.840
violated by the treacherous attack of Japan in 1904 shall be restored.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.360
And then they're all listed there.

11:37.360 --> 11:42.720
So basically, Stalin was asked to declare war on Japan after the war in Europe was finished,

11:42.720 --> 11:48.400
and he said, okay, but we want back all the stuff that Japan pinched off us back in 1904.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.920
Churchill and Roosevelt agreed, and so the deal was made.

11:51.920 --> 11:57.520
And this deal was kept secret for a few reasons, mainly because Russia is very big.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.400
It was going to take quite a bit of time for the Soviet Union

12:00.400 --> 12:03.840
to transfer military forces from the west to the east,

12:03.840 --> 12:07.760
and they didn't want to risk tipping Japan off to the impending invasion of Manchuria

12:07.760 --> 12:09.600
before it was ready to go ahead.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.200
President Roosevelt, for his part, thought this was a fair deal.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.360
He later stated that the Russians, quote,

12:15.360 --> 12:18.800
"...only want to get back that which has been taken from them."

12:18.800 --> 12:23.440
However, James Burns, then acting as advisor to Roosevelt at Yalta,

12:23.440 --> 12:27.280
worried that the more the United States asked of the Soviet Union,

12:27.280 --> 12:29.520
the more they would demand in return.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.680
Writing in his memoirs after the war,

12:31.680 --> 12:36.400
Burns makes it clear that he thinks too much was conceded to the Russians at Yalta,

12:36.400 --> 12:39.680
although he is careful to give reasons as to why he thinks

12:39.680 --> 12:43.040
the late President Roosevelt made the decisions he did.

12:43.040 --> 12:48.400
Burns does point out, however, that at the time the terms of the secret protocol were decided upon,

12:48.400 --> 12:51.600
he didn't know about them and thus had no influence over them

12:51.600 --> 12:54.400
because he was not Secretary of State.

12:54.400 --> 12:59.200
Mr. Stettinius was Secretary, referring to Edward Stettinius Jr.,

12:59.200 --> 13:02.480
who was Roosevelt's Secretary of State at Yalta.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.840
This is important for us here because although Truman kept on

13:05.840 --> 13:08.320
other of Roosevelt's staff after his death,

13:08.320 --> 13:10.480
he chose to replace Stettinius,

13:10.560 --> 13:14.800
feeling that too many concessions had been made to the Soviet Union at Yalta.

13:14.800 --> 13:18.720
And his new pick for Secretary of State was James Burns,

13:18.720 --> 13:23.600
a choice which signals a change towards a more aggressive stance with regards to Russia.

13:23.600 --> 13:28.560
Which leaves the United States in a bit of an awkward situation, diplomatically speaking.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.280
Under the previous President and Secretary of State,

13:31.280 --> 13:34.240
they'd signed a secret agreement with the Soviet Union,

13:34.240 --> 13:38.320
assuring them various concessions in exchange for going to war against Japan.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.480
But then that President died and his Secretary of State was replaced.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.200
And the incoming President and Secretary of State

13:45.200 --> 13:48.960
aren't at all as keen on conceding anything to the Russians.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.880
And I wonder if that's going to cause any problems down the line.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.320
So let's leave the Allies in their awkward situation there

13:56.320 --> 14:00.160
and discuss what the Japanese government was up to during this time.

14:00.160 --> 14:04.080
And to oversimplify a little, throughout this whole period,

14:04.080 --> 14:08.160
the Japanese leadership had basically a single main aim.

14:08.160 --> 14:12.000
And that was to avoid having to accept an unconditional surrender

14:12.000 --> 14:15.120
and instead achieve a negotiated peace.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.400
The Supreme Council in Japan knew that they couldn't win the war,

14:18.400 --> 14:22.080
but they wanted peace on terms that they could negotiate.

14:22.080 --> 14:27.440
Nazi Germany, of course, was forced to accept an unconditional surrender by the Allies.

14:27.440 --> 14:33.280
Unconditional surrender here meaning surrender without any guarantees being made to the losing side.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.120
And Japan was very keen to avoid a similar fate.

14:37.120 --> 14:41.760
The main sticking point was the question of Japan's imperial institution

14:41.760 --> 14:44.560
and the fate of the Emperor in particular.

14:44.560 --> 14:48.880
The Emperor was more than just a regular old leader in Japanese society.

14:48.880 --> 14:54.080
He was a revered, quasi-divine figure of particularly special importance.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.280
And with his position as the head of the Japanese government,

14:57.280 --> 15:00.080
and importantly, the Japanese military,

15:00.080 --> 15:05.360
Japan accepting unconditional surrender meant that the Emperor could then conceivably be arrested

15:05.360 --> 15:09.280
and tried for war crimes and possibly even executed.

15:09.280 --> 15:14.160
This was something that Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, when advising General MacArthur,

15:14.160 --> 15:18.640
described as comparable to the crucifixion of Christ to us.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.720
The United States was very aware of the special position of the Emperor

15:22.720 --> 15:25.840
and the gravity of the question of what should be done with him,

15:25.840 --> 15:27.840
but we'll get to that a little later.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.720
Now, there were disagreements in Japan's Supreme Council

15:30.720 --> 15:34.720
about what exact peace terms they should attempt to negotiate.

15:34.720 --> 15:38.160
On the more pessimistic, or realistic, end of the scale,

15:38.160 --> 15:41.760
we have Japan just getting out of the war however they can

15:41.760 --> 15:44.400
with the preservation of the imperial institution.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.360
So basically accepting whatever peace terms are offered

15:47.360 --> 15:50.480
so long as they guarantee the Emperor's position.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.320
And on the more optimistic, or unrealistic, end of the scale,

15:54.320 --> 15:59.600
we have Japan getting out of the war while securing the preservation of the imperial institution,

15:59.600 --> 16:02.720
securing the preservation of Japan's military forces,

16:02.720 --> 16:05.120
avoiding a foreign occupation,

16:05.120 --> 16:08.400
maintaining Japan's occupied overseas territories,

16:08.400 --> 16:13.840
and ensuring any trials for Japanese war crimes were carried out by Japan.

16:13.840 --> 16:18.000
Now this was all never going to happen, obviously, but it was argued for.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.520
The hardline militarists on the council were very keen on the preservation of the military,

16:23.520 --> 16:24.560
believe it or not.

16:24.560 --> 16:28.320
Holding out for these terms was obviously a desperate long shot,

16:28.320 --> 16:30.640
but these were equally desperate men.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.800
Regardless of these disagreements though,

16:32.800 --> 16:36.160
the Supreme Council was unified on the first point.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.280
They were absolutely not going to lose the Emperor,

16:39.280 --> 16:43.520
and therefore they want to avoid an unconditional surrender at any cost.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.520
And they pursued this goal both militarily and diplomatically.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.160
And let's talk about military strategy first.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.480
So the militarists on the Supreme Council

16:52.480 --> 16:56.000
favored a strategy of making the war so difficult for the Allies

16:56.000 --> 16:58.960
that they would lose their taste for unconditional surrender

16:58.960 --> 17:01.120
and decide to negotiate peace,

17:01.120 --> 17:05.440
rather than fight on for another year or so at huge cost to themselves.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.000
So Japan wasn't going to win the war.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.040
They knew that.

17:09.040 --> 17:13.440
But they were going to end it on terms that were more acceptable to them.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.200
The council anticipated an upcoming Allied invasion of Japan

17:17.200 --> 17:20.000
and planned to throw everything they had at it,

17:20.080 --> 17:21.600
including civilians,

17:21.600 --> 17:26.080
in order to wear down the Allied will to fight and thus secure better terms.

17:26.080 --> 17:30.560
A similar situation played out in miniature on the island of Okinawa.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.080
Now, Okinawa was occupied by the Japanese military,

17:34.080 --> 17:36.240
and when the US military invaded it,

17:36.240 --> 17:39.280
local inhabitants of the island, including children,

17:39.280 --> 17:43.840
were conscripted by the Japanese military and sent to die by the thousands.

17:43.840 --> 17:47.760
And by the time Okinawa was captured by the Allies on July the 2nd,

17:47.760 --> 17:53.840
both the Japanese and US militaries had lost considerable amounts of lives and military equipment.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.160
It was both a very costly loss and a very costly victory.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.720
President Truman, for his part, was very concerned about the losses at Okinawa

18:02.720 --> 18:06.640
and feared that committing to a full invasion of Japan could mean, quote,

18:06.640 --> 18:10.000
"...an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other."

18:10.000 --> 18:13.440
So that's the Supreme Council's military strategy there.

18:13.440 --> 18:17.360
Diplomatically, the council's plan was to convince the Soviet Union

18:17.360 --> 18:20.640
to mediate a peace between Japan and the other Allies,

18:20.640 --> 18:25.280
much like the United States that mediated peace at the end of the Russo-Japanese War.

18:25.280 --> 18:29.600
Japan was counting on the pact of neutrality they had with the Soviet Union

18:29.600 --> 18:31.920
to keep the Russians out of the war.

18:31.920 --> 18:35.840
They hoped that they would have a better chance at securing favorable peace terms

18:35.840 --> 18:38.080
if they had the Soviet Union backing them up,

18:38.080 --> 18:40.480
and in exchange for helping them with negotiations,

18:40.480 --> 18:43.280
the Japanese leadership was prepared to offer Stalin

18:43.280 --> 18:46.480
various territorial concessions from their empire.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.800
Now, unfortunately for the Japanese people,

18:48.800 --> 18:53.360
both the military and diplomatic strategies of the Japanese leadership were,

18:53.360 --> 18:55.520
to put it bluntly, rubbish.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.840
To take the diplomatic strategy first,

18:57.840 --> 19:00.400
in trying to persuade Stalin to help them out,

19:00.400 --> 19:03.120
they were bargaining from a position of weakness.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.680
They had nothing to offer the Soviet Union

19:05.680 --> 19:09.120
that it was not in a position to just take for itself.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.120
Stalin didn't want the war to end

19:11.120 --> 19:14.560
before he'd had the chance to invade and recapture the territory

19:14.560 --> 19:18.000
that had already been promised to him at the Yalta Conference.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.360
So why bargain with Japan in exchange for helping them

19:21.360 --> 19:24.400
when you could just invade them and take whatever you like?

19:24.400 --> 19:27.680
Stalin wanted to be in at the kill, as he put it,

19:27.680 --> 19:31.200
and he wasn't about to grant Japan a stay of execution.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.080
To accomplish this impossible diplomatic task,

19:34.080 --> 19:36.800
Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo

19:36.800 --> 19:40.240
sent frequent messages to Japan's ambassador in Moscow,

19:40.240 --> 19:41.520
Naotake Sato,

19:41.600 --> 19:46.000
instructing him to somehow convince the Russians to help Japan broker peace.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.800
Now, Sato was rather a lot more realistic than his colleagues back in Tokyo.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.160
He knew the Russians,

19:52.160 --> 19:56.560
he realized that the Council's plan was almost certainly not going to work,

19:56.560 --> 19:58.640
and he didn't mind telling them.

19:58.640 --> 20:01.360
In a series of increasingly frank messages

20:01.360 --> 20:03.520
sent in response to Togo's instructions,

20:03.520 --> 20:06.960
Sato attempted to make his superiors see sense.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.520
And let's quote a few of his cables here.

20:09.520 --> 20:13.520
It seems extremely unlikely that Russia would flout the Anglo-Americans

20:13.520 --> 20:15.600
and the opinion of the entire world

20:15.600 --> 20:20.240
by supporting Japan's war efforts with either moral or material means.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.360
I believe in the long run Japan has indeed no choice

20:23.360 --> 20:28.080
but to accept unconditional surrender or terms closely equivalent.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.920
I believe that Stalin feels there is absolutely no necessity

20:31.920 --> 20:34.880
for making a voluntary agreement with Japan.

20:34.880 --> 20:38.880
On this point, I see a serious discrepancy between your view

20:38.880 --> 20:41.280
and the actual state of affairs,

20:41.280 --> 20:43.760
which is a wonderfully insulting line there.

20:44.320 --> 20:48.800
Togo, however, didn't appreciate his subordinate's candor.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.840
He responded to one of Sato's complaints, quote,

20:51.840 --> 20:56.480
"...in spite of your views, you must carry out your instructions.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.440
Endeavor to obtain the good officers of the Soviet Union

20:59.440 --> 21:03.200
in ending the war short of unconditional surrender."

21:03.200 --> 21:07.840
And this is the general pattern of communication that went on between the two.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.400
Togo asked Sato to do the impossible.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.200
Sato attempted to explain that it was impossible.

21:13.200 --> 21:18.880
Togo told him to shut up, shut your face, just do it anyway, please.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.600
Thank you.

21:19.600 --> 21:24.240
And it's worth noting here that the Allies had cracked the Japanese communication codes

21:24.240 --> 21:26.560
and were freely reading Japan's messages,

21:26.560 --> 21:29.040
so they were privy to all of this information,

21:29.040 --> 21:33.520
as well as Togo and Sato's back-and-forth comedy routine they were working on.

21:33.520 --> 21:36.400
Now, militarily, the strategy of the Supreme Council

21:36.400 --> 21:39.520
was just as ill-fated as their diplomatic efforts.

21:39.520 --> 21:44.560
Expecting the opposing side to lose their nerve and call it quits faster than you

21:44.560 --> 21:49.760
when it's your territory being invaded and occupied is quite a risky strategy.

21:49.760 --> 21:55.840
It's also a strategy that hinges on the enemy first doing something that you expect them to do,

21:55.840 --> 21:58.480
that being here to invade Japan at all.

21:58.480 --> 22:02.400
An Allied invasion of Japan was not guaranteed to happen.

22:02.400 --> 22:06.080
The United States was working on plans to possibly invade Japan

22:06.080 --> 22:07.440
should it be necessary,

22:07.440 --> 22:11.680
but we should not make the mistake of thinking that because an invasion was being planned for

22:11.680 --> 22:13.440
that it was an inevitability.

22:13.440 --> 22:17.120
President Truman wrote in his diary on the 17th of June,

22:17.120 --> 22:21.200
shall we invade Japan proper or shall we bomb and blockade?

22:21.200 --> 22:23.040
And this is before the Trinity test,

22:23.040 --> 22:26.480
before Truman knows that he has nuclear bombs to work with

22:26.480 --> 22:28.960
or the effectiveness of those nuclear bombs.

22:28.960 --> 22:34.160
Before that, he's presenting an invasion as only one possible way forward.

22:34.160 --> 22:38.240
At the start of the video, I quoted several US military leaders

22:38.240 --> 22:42.480
who thought Japan would have surrendered prior to an invasion being necessary,

22:42.480 --> 22:45.120
regardless of the use of nuclear bombs.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.240
For example, Admiral Leahy, who described Japan as

22:48.240 --> 22:51.200
already defeated and ready to surrender.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.160
But just how defeated was Japan?

22:54.160 --> 22:57.760
Let's briefly talk about the state of the Japanese military.

22:57.760 --> 23:04.480
So firstly, by the middle of 1945, the Japanese Navy was virtually non-existent.

23:04.480 --> 23:08.800
Every Japanese aircraft carrier had been either sunk or disabled,

23:08.800 --> 23:11.120
hundreds of warships had been destroyed,

23:11.120 --> 23:14.080
and after the United States captured Okinawa,

23:14.080 --> 23:17.360
Japan's few remaining battleships were either decommissioned

23:17.360 --> 23:20.720
or used as stationary anti-aircraft platforms

23:20.720 --> 23:24.000
because Japan simply lacked the fuel to keep them moving.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.720
Outside of suicide attacks by small vessels,

23:26.720 --> 23:29.920
the Japanese Navy had ceased to exist,

23:29.920 --> 23:32.560
and that's not a rhetorical flourish by me there,

23:32.560 --> 23:36.320
that's a quote from the US summary report of the Pacific War.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.880
In the air, Japan was faring no better.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.400
There was a shortage of bombers, fighters, trained pilots,

23:42.400 --> 23:47.440
materials to construct aircraft out of, and fuel to keep them in the air.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.840
As you'll probably be aware, by the end of the war,

23:49.920 --> 23:54.720
Japan was resorting to suicide missions carried out by poorly trained pilots

23:54.720 --> 23:58.480
instructed to simply crash their planes into enemy ships.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.440
Due in part to the rushed training of the pilots

24:01.440 --> 24:05.040
and the increasingly poor construction of the aircraft they were flying,

24:05.040 --> 24:08.720
fewer than a fifth of these planes actually hit their targets.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.120
On the other side, the United States Air Force

24:11.120 --> 24:14.880
was conducting constant bombing raids on targets inside Japan,

24:14.880 --> 24:18.960
basically as it pleased, meeting little to no resistance in the air.

24:18.960 --> 24:23.760
General Curtis LeMay, the man in charge of America's air offensive against Japan,

24:23.760 --> 24:29.040
later claimed that he did not lose a single B-29 bomber to Japanese fighters.

24:29.040 --> 24:33.200
And to quote the strategic bombing survey I mentioned near the start of the video,

24:33.200 --> 24:36.000
United States planes crisscrossed the skies

24:36.000 --> 24:40.160
with no effective Japanese air or anti-aircraft opposition.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.880
Given its collapse both in the air and at sea,

24:42.880 --> 24:46.080
a naval blockade was able to be put in place around Japan,

24:46.080 --> 24:50.400
which firstly was absolutely devastating for the Japanese economy.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.760
Almost their entire merchant fleet was picked off and destroyed,

24:53.760 --> 24:59.680
and imports of vital resources like coal, crude oil, iron ore, and rubber stopped.

24:59.680 --> 25:05.520
As a result, many Japanese ports, such as the one at Hiroshima, simply ceased to operate.

25:05.520 --> 25:08.640
The blockade also had the effect of dramatically reducing

25:08.640 --> 25:14.880
the scattered Japanese ground forces' ability to communicate, resupply, and redeploy.

25:14.880 --> 25:18.720
Without their navy, Japan's troops were increasingly under-supplied

25:18.720 --> 25:21.360
as well as stranded wherever they happened to be.

25:21.360 --> 25:25.680
So, given the absolutely dismal state of the Japanese military situation,

25:25.680 --> 25:28.320
it is presumptuous of the Supreme Council to assume

25:28.320 --> 25:32.560
that the United States had to commit to a costly ground invasion at all.

25:32.560 --> 25:37.920
The Americans could, if they wanted to, simply maintain their naval blockade and bombing campaign,

25:37.920 --> 25:41.360
and there would be very little that the Japanese leadership could do about it.

25:41.360 --> 25:45.120
They were counting on the United States first launching an invasion,

25:45.120 --> 25:47.440
and only then losing faith in it.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.720
Of course, another possibility is that the United States could decide

25:50.720 --> 25:54.720
they didn't want to do a ground invasion before they'd started one,

25:54.720 --> 25:58.960
which is, of course, what happened, but we're getting a little ahead of ourselves there.

25:58.960 --> 26:03.280
Now, it is clear from their awful, unsalvageable military situation

26:03.280 --> 26:07.760
that Japan's leaders should have surrendered much sooner than they did,

26:07.760 --> 26:09.760
and indeed, some wanted to,

26:09.760 --> 26:15.600
but so long as the hardline militarist faction in the Supreme Council insisted on continuing the war,

26:15.600 --> 26:19.440
there was little that those who desired peace could do about it.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.200
Directly, anyway.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.240
Behind the scenes, members of the Japanese leadership

26:24.240 --> 26:29.600
who realized that the war needed to be finished were working on plans to that end,

26:29.600 --> 26:31.680
but we'll get to those in due time.

26:31.680 --> 26:35.280
For now, though, the Supreme Council remained deadlocked,

26:35.280 --> 26:40.480
and the terribly sad thing about all this is that while the leadership of Japan waited uselessly

26:40.480 --> 26:45.520
for either an American ground invasion or rescue from the Soviet Union,

26:45.520 --> 26:49.920
their civilian population centers were being systematically destroyed.

26:49.920 --> 26:54.320
And here we need to introduce the concept of strategic bombing,

26:54.320 --> 26:59.440
that being the intentional targeting of enemy cities with area bombing raids

26:59.440 --> 27:03.520
with the aim of destroying the enemy's morale and industry.

27:03.520 --> 27:09.600
Now, strategic bombing is interesting in that its name changes depending on who is doing it to whom.

27:09.600 --> 27:14.160
When we're doing it to them, it's called strategic or morale bombing,

27:14.160 --> 27:19.360
and it's a calculated, emotionless tactic intended to bring a swift end to the war

27:19.360 --> 27:23.360
by breaking enemy morale and disrupting their war industry.

27:23.360 --> 27:27.680
When they're doing it to us, on the other hand, it's called terror bombing,

27:27.680 --> 27:32.400
and it's a cowardly, despicable tactic intended to instill fear in the population

27:32.480 --> 27:35.840
by the ruthless slaughter of innocent women and children.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.400
It all depends on your point of view, really.

27:38.400 --> 27:43.520
The strategy of indiscriminate area bombing had been used prior to World War II,

27:43.520 --> 27:46.640
but it was during the war that it really got up to speed.

27:46.640 --> 27:51.440
The Nazis were targeting civilians with bombs from the very start of the war,

27:51.440 --> 27:56.800
and notably one of the aims of their Blitz bombing campaign against cities in the United Kingdom

27:56.800 --> 28:00.160
was to break the morale of the British civilian population.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.920
The British Royal Air Force began the war favoring precision,

28:03.920 --> 28:07.040
tactical bombing strikes against specific targets,

28:07.040 --> 28:12.400
but they soon got with the times and adopted an area bombing strategy against German cities,

28:12.400 --> 28:16.960
one of the aims of which was to break the morale of the German civilian population.

28:16.960 --> 28:22.560
And there were two main branches of thinking behind making civilians the target of bombing raids.

28:22.560 --> 28:26.400
There's the material reasoning and the psychological reasoning,

28:26.400 --> 28:29.440
and we'll talk about the material reasoning first.

28:29.440 --> 28:35.760
So, why spend time and resources trying to exclusively bomb small, mobile military targets

28:35.760 --> 28:39.280
that can fight back when you can just fly behind those targets

28:39.280 --> 28:42.800
and bomb the factories and shipyards that are producing them?

28:42.800 --> 28:45.840
And those factories and shipyards supplying the military,

28:45.840 --> 28:50.160
they're staffed by civilians who usually live in nearby houses.

28:50.160 --> 28:54.640
They're also culpable to some degree for keeping the war machine going, right?

28:54.720 --> 28:59.280
And if we bomb them, there will be fewer workers to work at those factories,

28:59.280 --> 29:04.160
and therefore will reduce the enemy country's production and end the war quicker.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.200
So it's not that we want to bomb civilians, you see,

29:07.200 --> 29:11.200
it's simply that we think this will be less painful in the long run.

29:11.200 --> 29:16.800
Now, cities aren't solely comprised of war factories and worker housing, of course.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.960
But all the other things in the city,

29:18.960 --> 29:22.400
the non-military industries that keep those workers alive,

29:22.400 --> 29:25.520
the hospitals that heal them when they're sick and injured,

29:25.520 --> 29:28.320
the schools that educate their children,

29:28.320 --> 29:31.760
all these things are connected in varying degrees

29:31.760 --> 29:35.440
to the functioning of that society's capacity for war.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.680
So, following this logic, you can just bomb everything

29:39.680 --> 29:44.160
by, in effect, reclassifying everything in the city as a military target.

29:44.720 --> 29:48.000
Once you've done this, bombing civilians is impossible,

29:48.000 --> 29:49.840
because there are no civilians.

29:49.840 --> 29:53.360
The city is just one big military installation.

29:53.360 --> 29:58.800
Now, it is worth noting here that the United States did not enter the war with this mindset.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.640
In 1939, President Roosevelt sent an appeal to

30:02.640 --> 30:06.720
refrain from air bombing of civilians to various countries,

30:06.720 --> 30:08.160
and that reads as follows.

30:08.160 --> 30:13.040
"...the ruthless bombing from the air of civilians in unfortified centers of population

30:13.040 --> 30:17.040
during the course of hostilities which have raged in various quarters of the earth

30:17.040 --> 30:20.960
during the past few years, which has resulted in the maiming and in the death

30:20.960 --> 30:24.080
of thousands of defenseless men, women and children,

30:24.080 --> 30:27.600
has sickened the hearts of every civilized man and woman

30:27.600 --> 30:30.880
and has profoundly shocked the conscience of humanity."

30:30.880 --> 30:34.400
If resort is had to this form of inhuman barbarism

30:34.400 --> 30:39.040
during the period of the tragic conflagration with which the world is now confronted,

30:39.040 --> 30:43.280
hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings who have no responsibility for,

30:43.280 --> 30:46.080
and who are not even remotely participating in,

30:46.080 --> 30:49.920
the hostilities which have now broken out, will lose their lives.

30:49.920 --> 30:53.360
"...I am therefore addressing this urgent appeal to every government

30:53.360 --> 30:57.680
which may be engaged in hostilities publicly to affirm its determination

30:57.680 --> 31:02.800
that its armed forces shall in no event and under no circumstances

31:02.800 --> 31:07.040
undertake the bombardment from the air of civilian populations."

31:07.040 --> 31:12.400
So, some very high-minded words from a leader not yet in the war there.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.840
A few years later, however, the United States was in the war

31:15.840 --> 31:19.280
and its military leaders saw things a little differently.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.680
And to quote General Curtis LeMay,

31:21.680 --> 31:23.920
"...there are no innocent civilians.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.720
It is their government and you are fighting a people.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.520
You are not trying to fight an armed force anymore,

31:29.520 --> 31:34.880
so it doesn't bother me so much to be killing the so-called innocent bystanders."

31:34.880 --> 31:39.200
LeMay's bombing strategy proceeded exactly as if he rarely believed

31:39.200 --> 31:41.920
there were no innocent civilians in Japan.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.640
Once Allied bombers were able to reach Japan,

31:44.640 --> 31:48.240
mass fire bombings of Japanese population centers began,

31:48.240 --> 31:51.680
killing and displacing hundreds of thousands of civilians.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.640
The fire bombing of Tokyo on the 9th and 10th of March

31:54.640 --> 32:00.800
killed an estimated 100,000 people by itself and made a million more homeless.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.720
So, in the course of just a few years,

32:02.720 --> 32:06.880
the bombing of innocent civilians went from inhuman barbarism

32:06.880 --> 32:09.520
to there are no innocent civilians.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.800
Civilians were just another military asset to be bombed

32:12.800 --> 32:15.520
as far as the Allied air force was concerned.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.400
Now, the other line of reasoning for strategic bombing

32:18.400 --> 32:20.720
was the possible psychological effects

32:20.720 --> 32:24.160
that would result from the bombing of civilian population centers.

32:24.160 --> 32:28.080
Those being that perhaps the population would lose faith in their government

32:28.080 --> 32:30.880
or the soldiers on the front lines would be demoralized

32:30.880 --> 32:33.920
by their families and homes being bombed while they were away,

32:33.920 --> 32:39.200
and all this would therefore lead to an increased likelihood for the enemy to surrender.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.680
And the material reasoning for the bombing

32:41.680 --> 32:46.960
was often used merely as a pretext for this actual psychological aim.

32:46.960 --> 32:51.360
Winston Churchill let this slip in a memo he drafted on the 28th of March

32:51.360 --> 32:54.560
in which he addresses the controversial bombing of Dresden

32:54.560 --> 32:58.560
which took place between the 13th and 15th of February.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.880
In this memo, Churchill says,

33:00.880 --> 33:02.960
"...it seems to me that the moment has come

33:02.960 --> 33:05.520
when the question of bombing of German cities

33:05.520 --> 33:08.560
simply for the sake of increasing the terror,

33:08.560 --> 33:12.160
though under other pretexts, should be reviewed.

33:12.160 --> 33:16.000
Otherwise, we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.640
The foreign secretary has spoken to me on this subject

33:18.640 --> 33:22.720
and I feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives

33:22.720 --> 33:26.480
such as oil and communications behind the immediate battle zone

33:26.480 --> 33:31.520
rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive."

33:32.080 --> 33:36.240
So, bombing simply for the sake of increasing the terror,

33:36.240 --> 33:38.560
though under other pretexts.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.360
So you're bombing civilians to break enemy morale

33:41.360 --> 33:43.680
and if anyone gets squeamish about that, you say,

33:43.680 --> 33:47.120
oh, don't worry, I know we hit a few schools and hospitals there

33:47.120 --> 33:50.400
but we were actually aiming at that factory a few streets over

33:50.400 --> 33:53.360
that makes boots for the army or something.

33:53.360 --> 33:58.240
Every city had something or other in it that supported the armed forces in some way,

33:58.240 --> 34:04.000
and thus there was always a handy excuse for indiscriminately area bombing anywhere.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.480
Now this strategy is, and was at the time, very controversial,

34:08.480 --> 34:10.320
not just from a moral standpoint,

34:10.320 --> 34:13.440
I mean, that's obvious, you're blowing up innocent people,

34:13.440 --> 34:16.720
but it was also controversial in terms of its effectiveness.

34:16.720 --> 34:21.360
And first let's talk about the effectiveness of area bombing's material goals.

34:21.360 --> 34:25.760
Firstly, even with the enormous amount of bombs which were dropped on Nazi Germany,

34:25.760 --> 34:29.440
the country's production actually increased throughout the war.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.120
And this happened for a few reasons,

34:31.680 --> 34:36.480
one of which was that Nazi Germany used millions of people as slave labor.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.760
Many German factories were staffed by prisoners.

34:39.760 --> 34:43.600
When you're a fascist regime occupying whole other countries,

34:43.600 --> 34:45.440
lives are very cheap.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.560
Also, whatever damage was done to German industry

34:48.560 --> 34:53.200
during indiscriminate area bombing raids on cities was relatively minor,

34:53.200 --> 34:56.240
because, to quote the Strategic Bombing Survey,

35:04.240 --> 35:07.920
Now you could say Nazi Germany's production would have increased further

35:07.920 --> 35:09.840
without the area bombings, of course,

35:09.840 --> 35:12.400
but we're not talking about reducing production,

35:12.400 --> 35:16.000
then we're talking about slowing down the increase of production,

35:16.000 --> 35:20.160
which is less likely to be a major contributing factor to a surrender.

35:20.240 --> 35:25.200
We also have to consider here that while your air force is bombing civilian housing

35:25.200 --> 35:27.280
with the aim of breaking their morale,

35:27.280 --> 35:31.040
they're not bombing other things which it might be more useful to bomb.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.800
The Strategic Bombing Survey concludes that Allied bombing raids on,

35:34.800 --> 35:39.200
for instance, the Nazis oil refineries and transportation network,

35:39.200 --> 35:41.680
were key to hastening the end of the war.

35:41.680 --> 35:46.000
In particular, it calls the targeting of Germany's railways and waterways

35:46.000 --> 35:50.400
the decisive blow that completely disorganized the German economy.

35:50.400 --> 35:55.760
It also concludes that the importance of careful selection of targets for air attack

35:55.760 --> 35:58.480
is emphasized by the German experience.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.840
The Germans were far more concerned over attacks on one or more

36:01.840 --> 36:04.400
of their basic industries and services,

36:04.400 --> 36:06.640
their oil, chemical, or steel industries,

36:06.640 --> 36:09.120
or their power or transportation network,

36:09.120 --> 36:13.920
than they were over attacks on their armament industry or the city areas.

36:13.920 --> 36:17.680
So the specific targeting of key industries and transport networks

36:17.680 --> 36:20.720
was more effective than indiscriminate area bombing

36:20.720 --> 36:23.760
and the destruction of civilian housing, basically.

36:23.760 --> 36:27.680
Next, let's talk about the psychological effectiveness of area bombing.

36:27.680 --> 36:32.320
The thinking that area bombing would lead to a surrender caused by a breakdown in morale

36:32.320 --> 36:34.240
turned out to have a few flaws.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.560
Firstly, on the government end,

36:36.560 --> 36:40.160
militaristic, totalitarian, fascist regimes

36:40.160 --> 36:44.080
don't care about the opinions or well-being of their civilians.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.160
So they're not likely to throw in the towel

36:46.160 --> 36:50.640
just because lots of ordinary people are getting killed or injured or made homeless.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.160
They don't care about that.

36:52.160 --> 36:58.560
Caring about people is not high on the list of priorities for totalitarian fascist regimes.

36:58.560 --> 37:01.040
On the civilian end, there's several reasons

37:01.040 --> 37:04.800
why trying to break their morale didn't lead to the end of the war.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.000
You know, beyond their government's not caring what they think.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.240
Firstly, as much as people might be terrorized by indiscriminate bombing raids,

37:12.240 --> 37:16.000
they were also already being terrorized by their own governments

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
and the police force of those governments.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.080
It's one thing to have your morale shaken

37:20.080 --> 37:22.720
and decide things would be better if Hitler was gone,

37:22.720 --> 37:27.600
and it's another thing to translate that into action and go and fight the Gestapo.

37:27.600 --> 37:31.440
Someone might not like having their city bombed and their house burnt down,

37:31.440 --> 37:33.840
but that doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna go out

37:33.840 --> 37:37.200
and rebel against the government and risk being executed.

37:37.200 --> 37:41.120
This is Arthur Harris, perhaps better known as Bomber Harris,

37:41.120 --> 37:43.920
who was the commander-in-chief of RAF Bomber Command

37:43.920 --> 37:46.000
during the height of the Second World War,

37:46.000 --> 37:50.560
and he oversaw the United Kingdom's area bombing campaign against German cities,

37:50.560 --> 37:52.640
including the bombing of Dresden.

37:52.640 --> 37:55.440
Now, as you might be able to tell from his nickname,

37:55.440 --> 37:59.760
Bomber Harris was a very enthusiastic supporter of area bombing,

37:59.760 --> 38:02.640
and he was also a very enthusiastic supporter

38:02.640 --> 38:05.920
of being honest about the point of area bombing.

38:05.920 --> 38:09.200
And let's read a quote of his from 1943.

38:09.200 --> 38:13.840
"...the aim of the combined bomber offensive should be unambiguously stated

38:13.840 --> 38:17.600
as the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers,

38:17.600 --> 38:20.560
and the disruption of civilized life throughout Germany.

38:20.560 --> 38:24.960
The destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives,

38:24.960 --> 38:28.480
the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale,

38:28.480 --> 38:31.840
and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battlefronts

38:31.920 --> 38:35.040
by fear of extended and intensified bombing

38:35.040 --> 38:38.880
are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy.

38:38.880 --> 38:42.800
They are not byproducts of attempts to hit factories."

38:42.800 --> 38:46.960
So when he said this, he was clearly in favor of area bombing as a tactic,

38:46.960 --> 38:50.560
and also in favor of being honest about the aim of it.

38:50.560 --> 38:55.760
The point was to disrupt civilian life, kill people, and spread fear.

38:55.760 --> 39:00.160
However, after the war, Bomber Harris changed his mind.

39:00.160 --> 39:03.680
In his 1947 book, Bomber Offensive,

39:03.680 --> 39:07.920
Harris writes that while in 1941 it had seemed like a good idea

39:07.920 --> 39:10.640
to use area bombing to break the enemy's morale,

39:10.640 --> 39:14.240
in the long run it proved to be wholly unsound.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.200
And I quote,

39:15.200 --> 39:19.360
"...when we had destroyed almost all the larger industrial cities in Germany,

39:19.360 --> 39:22.080
the civil population remained apathetic,

39:22.080 --> 39:24.800
while the Gestapo saw to it that they were docile,

39:24.800 --> 39:28.720
and insofar as there was work left for them to do, industrious."

39:28.720 --> 39:31.200
Morale bombing was comparatively ineffective

39:31.200 --> 39:34.400
against so well organized a police state as Germany.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.120
The German leaders themselves admitted after the war

39:37.120 --> 39:40.240
that morale was bad after our attacks on their towns,

39:40.240 --> 39:44.720
but they distinguished between the morale and the conduct of the workers.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.520
Conduct, they say, was unaffected.

39:47.520 --> 39:51.120
In other words, there was nothing unarmed Germans could do about it

39:51.120 --> 39:56.240
with the Gestapo standing by and with the concentration camp round the corner.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.200
So that's the failure of morale bombing

39:59.200 --> 40:02.560
from someone who was previously both very in favor of it

40:02.560 --> 40:05.200
and directly responsible for it there.

40:05.200 --> 40:09.360
And the Strategic Bombing Survey also covers the same topic, saying,

40:09.360 --> 40:12.000
"...if they," that's the German civilians,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.880
"...had been at liberty to vote themselves out of the war,

40:14.880 --> 40:18.000
they would have done so well before the final surrender.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.320
In a determined police state, however,

40:20.320 --> 40:25.520
there is a wide difference between dissatisfaction and expressed opposition."

40:25.520 --> 40:29.280
About the nicest thing you can say about this morale bombing idea

40:29.280 --> 40:33.920
is that some people apparently thought it might work, but it didn't.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.720
And it just so happens that in the course of it not working,

40:36.720 --> 40:39.280
it pointlessly killed, injured, and displaced

40:39.280 --> 40:41.760
a very large number of innocent civilians.

40:41.760 --> 40:44.480
Attempts to break the morale of the German citizenry

40:44.480 --> 40:49.440
with terror bombing tactics led to apathy, not revolutionary action.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.480
And not to get too armchair general on you all here,

40:52.480 --> 40:57.200
but I don't mind concluding that every single bomb that was dropped on a German house

40:57.200 --> 41:01.760
would have been better put to use if it was dropped instead on a German railway line

41:01.760 --> 41:05.040
or something else of actual military significance.

41:05.040 --> 41:08.800
However, I would like to make clear here that by no means am I saying

41:08.800 --> 41:13.840
we should absolve the entire German citizenry of all fault in the Second World War.

41:14.400 --> 41:18.560
Many civilians were, of course, committed supporters of the Nazi Party

41:18.560 --> 41:21.920
and often participants in its various crimes.

41:21.920 --> 41:26.800
When I say innocent civilians, I absolutely do not mean those people.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.840
However, many German citizens were innocent,

41:29.840 --> 41:32.560
many were persecuted by the Nazis themselves,

41:32.560 --> 41:34.800
or many were children, for instance,

41:34.800 --> 41:40.400
and sadly, indiscriminate area bombing does not discern between these groups of people.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.880
Now, all this is important for us today

41:42.880 --> 41:46.160
because the manner in which the atomic bombs were targeted and used

41:46.160 --> 41:50.240
was merely an extension of this morale bombing philosophy.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.320
So let's talk a little about that.

41:52.320 --> 41:54.800
In the months before the atomic bomb was used,

41:54.800 --> 41:58.960
a group of scientists and military personnel dubbed the Target Committee

41:58.960 --> 42:03.760
was established by director of the Manhattan Project, General Leslie Groves,

42:03.760 --> 42:08.160
and this group met several times to discuss how the bombs should be used.

42:08.160 --> 42:11.040
And the minutes of the meetings of the Target Committee

42:11.040 --> 42:16.160
give us an insight into the thinking behind the target selection for the bombs.

42:16.160 --> 42:20.240
On the 10th of May, the group met in the office of J. Robert Oppenheimer,

42:20.240 --> 42:22.800
who was the head of the laboratory that designed the bombs

42:22.800 --> 42:25.440
and one of the scientists on the committee.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.960
And they discussed various points relating to how the bomb should be used.

42:29.520 --> 42:32.000
One key point for us here is the section

42:32.000 --> 42:37.040
Psychological Factors in Target Selection, and that reads as follows.

42:37.040 --> 42:42.880
It was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance.

42:42.880 --> 42:48.400
Two aspects of this are one, obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan,

42:48.400 --> 42:52.880
and two, making the initial use sufficiently spectacular

42:52.880 --> 42:56.320
for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized

42:56.320 --> 42:58.800
when publicity on it is released.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.920
So when picking targets here, they're not just thinking

43:01.920 --> 43:05.360
about the psychological effects upon the inhabitants of Japan,

43:05.360 --> 43:10.320
they're also already thinking about the effects the bomb will have outside of the war.

43:10.320 --> 43:13.920
They want the bomb to be sufficiently spectacular,

43:13.920 --> 43:17.120
like they're setting off a big firework or something.

43:17.120 --> 43:22.400
Furthermore, still under the psychological factors heading regarding Hiroshima,

43:22.400 --> 43:26.880
it was put forward that Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size

43:26.880 --> 43:30.000
and with possible focusing from nearby mountains

43:30.000 --> 43:34.320
that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.560
That's an advantage, remember.

43:36.560 --> 43:42.880
So in picking Hiroshima as a target, they were aiming to destroy a large fraction of the city

43:42.880 --> 43:46.880
due specifically to the associated psychological factors.

43:46.880 --> 43:50.720
Reading these minutes, it is clear that the members of the target committee

43:50.720 --> 43:54.240
were much more focused on the psychological effects of the bomb

43:54.240 --> 43:59.040
than its practical physical effects upon Japan's military capabilities.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.800
Regarding this, they write,

44:00.800 --> 44:05.600
Use against military objectives. Nice use of quotation marks there.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.320
It was agreed that for the initial use of the weapon,

44:08.320 --> 44:13.920
any small and strictly military objective should be located in a much larger area

44:13.920 --> 44:17.600
subject to blast damage in order to avoid undue risks

44:17.600 --> 44:21.360
of the weapon being lost due to bad placing of the bomb.

44:21.360 --> 44:25.280
So they didn't want to bomb an isolated, strictly military target

44:25.280 --> 44:28.080
for fear of missing and losing the weapon.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.080
Whereas if they drop the bomb on a city,

44:30.080 --> 44:33.920
missing their air quotes, military target is just fine

44:33.920 --> 44:37.760
because a large fraction of the city will still be destroyed regardless

44:37.760 --> 44:42.720
and therefore the bomb will still convey the very important psychological effects.

44:42.720 --> 44:45.680
Now, I don't know any way of reading this other than

44:45.680 --> 44:49.280
it's okay if we don't actually hit a military objective

44:49.280 --> 44:51.520
so long as we still hit a city.

44:51.520 --> 44:55.200
Actual material effects upon Japan's military capabilities

44:55.200 --> 44:58.000
were clearly not of prime importance here.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.520
It is very telling that the top of their target list was Kyoto,

45:01.520 --> 45:06.320
the former capital of Japan, which was of relatively little military significance

45:06.320 --> 45:09.280
but enormous psychological importance.

45:09.280 --> 45:15.360
They also include the ludicrous reasoning that since Kyoto is an intellectual center for Japan,

45:15.360 --> 45:20.320
the people there are more apt to appreciate the significance of such a weapon,

45:20.320 --> 45:24.720
as if the inhabitants of the other cities of Japan would be simply too unintelligent

45:24.800 --> 45:29.040
to understand the significance of their city being exploded.

45:29.040 --> 45:32.800
In the end, of course, Kyoto was not hit with an atomic bomb.

45:32.800 --> 45:36.160
General Leslie Groves wanted very much to bomb Kyoto,

45:36.160 --> 45:40.480
but after a lot of stalling, it was reluctantly taken off the list of targets

45:40.480 --> 45:45.200
on the persistent and repeated orders of Secretary of War Henry Stimson,

45:45.200 --> 45:50.800
who, and yes, this is the actual reason, once went there on holiday.

45:50.800 --> 45:54.160
At a meeting of the Interim Committee on the 31st of May,

45:54.160 --> 45:59.840
Stimson described Kyoto as exclusively a place of homes and art and shrines,

45:59.840 --> 46:02.560
and argued it must not be bombed.

46:02.560 --> 46:06.800
The minutes of this meeting on the 31st of May reveal the confusing

46:06.800 --> 46:10.720
and contradictory list of requirements for the bomb targets.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.480
And let's read a little from the section

46:12.480 --> 46:16.320
Effect of the Bombing on the Japanese and Their Will to Fight.

46:16.320 --> 46:21.200
After much discussion concerning various types of targets and the effects to be produced,

46:21.200 --> 46:25.280
the Secretary expressed the conclusion, on which there was general agreement,

46:25.280 --> 46:28.000
that we could not give the Japanese any warning,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.960
that we could not concentrate on a civilian area,

46:30.960 --> 46:34.560
but that we should seek to make a profound psychological impression

46:34.560 --> 46:37.200
on as many of the inhabitants as possible.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.600
Now, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

46:40.160 --> 46:43.760
If you aren't concentrating upon a civilian area,

46:43.760 --> 46:49.200
how do you make a profound psychological impression upon as many inhabitants as possible?

46:49.200 --> 46:52.800
It's not going to make much of an impression on the Japanese population

46:52.800 --> 46:58.000
if you drop the bomb on some isolated military target somewhere where no one will see it.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.280
It would just be one more thing that got bombed that day.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.080
This was brought up in the meeting when someone, quote,

47:04.080 --> 47:06.960
"...pointed out that one atomic bomb dropped on an arsenal

47:06.960 --> 47:12.160
would not be much different from the effect caused by any air core strike of present dimensions.

47:12.160 --> 47:18.080
However, Dr. Oppenheimer stated that the visual effect of an atomic bombing would be tremendous.

47:18.080 --> 47:20.720
It would be accompanied by a brilliant luminescence,

47:20.720 --> 47:24.080
which would rise to a height of 10,000 to 20,000 feet."

47:24.080 --> 47:28.160
So that's the key thing here that's supposed to differentiate the nuclear bombs

47:28.160 --> 47:30.000
from the conventional bombing raids.

47:30.000 --> 47:34.240
It's not the material effect upon Japanese military capabilities,

47:34.240 --> 47:36.080
it's how impressive they look.

47:36.080 --> 47:39.760
Now, of course, if you want to create a profound psychological effect

47:39.760 --> 47:42.160
with your big, impressive-looking bomb,

47:42.160 --> 47:45.200
you need to drop it somewhere where people can see it.

47:45.200 --> 47:48.800
So how do you drop the bomb on a strictly military target

47:48.800 --> 47:54.080
while ensuring there are lots of Japanese inhabitants around to see how tremendous it is?

47:54.080 --> 47:58.720
The members of the meeting wriggled their way out of this conundrum with the following euphemism.

47:59.280 --> 48:05.280
The most desirable target would be a vital war plant employing a large number of workers

48:05.280 --> 48:08.480
and closely surrounded by workers' houses.

48:09.040 --> 48:12.000
So we're not bombing a civilian area, to be clear.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.560
We are not aiming at houses.

48:14.560 --> 48:19.040
We're aiming at a factory closely surrounded by houses.

48:19.040 --> 48:21.680
And if we happen to miss the factory, that's okay.

48:21.680 --> 48:26.560
We won't lose the bomb because it will still destroy a large fraction of the city, remember.

48:26.560 --> 48:30.400
But again, we're not targeting the civilians, we promise.

48:31.040 --> 48:34.080
What a load of rubbish, honestly.

48:34.080 --> 48:38.640
They want to bomb civilians, they have decided to bomb civilians,

48:38.640 --> 48:42.240
and they know it, but they're too cowardly to admit it.

48:42.240 --> 48:44.960
So they're pretending the desired effects of the bomb

48:44.960 --> 48:50.800
will merely be the byproduct of an attempt to hit a factory, as Bomber Harris put it.

48:50.800 --> 48:54.560
Now Secretary Stimpson went along with this ridiculous euphemism,

48:54.560 --> 48:58.640
or at least contented himself with having saved his pet city of Kyoto.

48:59.360 --> 49:02.560
The other target cities were placed on a no bomb list,

49:02.560 --> 49:05.360
meaning that they were not to be targeted by the Air Force

49:05.360 --> 49:09.520
with conventional bombings prior to being hit with the atomic bombs.

49:09.520 --> 49:13.440
This was because another desired attribute of the potential bomb targets

49:13.440 --> 49:16.880
was that they were, as far as possible, undamaged,

49:16.880 --> 49:21.360
so as to better demonstrate the destructive power of the atomic bomb.

49:21.360 --> 49:24.880
They want a spectacular show, after all.

49:24.880 --> 49:28.000
Now this requirement speaks to the relative military

49:28.000 --> 49:31.600
unimportance of the cities that ended up making the list.

49:31.600 --> 49:37.120
They were thus far undamaged, in part because they were not high-priority military targets.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.120
This is something for us to keep in mind

49:39.120 --> 49:42.160
when considering those justifications for the atomic bombs

49:42.160 --> 49:47.040
that highlight whatever military industry existed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

49:47.040 --> 49:50.000
Because whatever military industry existed in those cities

49:50.000 --> 49:53.440
did so specifically because they were not being attacked,

49:53.440 --> 49:56.560
initially because of the city's relative unimportance

49:56.560 --> 49:59.040
compared with higher value bombing targets,

49:59.040 --> 50:02.320
and following that because they were on this no bomb list.

50:02.320 --> 50:07.040
Allied bombers had attacked dozens of Japanese cities with conventional weapons.

50:07.200 --> 50:11.760
Tokyo was extensively firebombed months before the atomic bombs were dropped.

50:11.760 --> 50:16.320
There was nothing stopping Allied bombers from also attacking the list of target cities

50:16.320 --> 50:20.000
if they were supposed to be so important to Japan's military efforts,

50:20.000 --> 50:23.520
except for the fact that they were being preserved, on purpose,

50:23.520 --> 50:25.840
to be destroyed with atomic bombs.

50:25.840 --> 50:30.080
Now, of course, before the bomb was used in the field, it was first tested.

50:30.080 --> 50:35.120
And the timing of the first nuclear test detonation, codenamed the Trinity Test,

50:35.120 --> 50:37.600
caused a problem for President Truman,

50:37.600 --> 50:40.240
as the upcoming Potsdam Conference in Germany

50:40.240 --> 50:43.200
meant that he personally would be out of the country.

50:43.200 --> 50:46.160
Truman actually wanted to delay the Potsdam Conference

50:46.160 --> 50:48.640
until a little while after the Trinity Test,

50:48.640 --> 50:52.640
so that he would know, going into diplomatic negotiations there,

50:52.640 --> 50:55.440
whether or not he had the nuclear bombs to play with.

50:55.440 --> 50:59.840
But he had to settle for getting the news while he was at the conference.

50:59.840 --> 51:02.640
Now, before we get into talking about the Potsdam Conference,

51:02.720 --> 51:06.240
I'd just like to recap what our principal actors are up to here.

51:06.880 --> 51:11.840
So, Truman was stating his intent to get Russia to commit to the Japanese war,

51:11.840 --> 51:16.160
and he later wrote that it was his main objective in going to Potsdam.

51:16.160 --> 51:19.440
The Soviet Union was ignoring Japan's peace feelers

51:19.440 --> 51:22.320
and, per the secret agreement they made at Yalta,

51:22.320 --> 51:27.840
preparing to void the non-aggression pact they had with Japan and invade Manchuria.

51:27.840 --> 51:31.440
Japan was organizing a diplomatic mission to travel to Moscow

51:31.440 --> 51:33.200
and meet with Stalin directly,

51:33.200 --> 51:37.280
in order to hopefully convince him to negotiate an end to the war.

51:37.280 --> 51:41.120
This diplomatic mission was led by Prince Fumimaro Konoe.

51:41.120 --> 51:45.280
Now, Konoe was a prestigious politician and former prime minister

51:45.280 --> 51:49.360
who, prior to the war, had advised against attacking America.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.440
He thought Pearl Harbor was a mistake,

51:51.440 --> 51:54.560
and he was very critical of the hardline militarists,

51:54.560 --> 51:58.480
stating in a report to the Emperor in February of 1945

51:58.480 --> 52:02.480
that they were the greatest obstacle to a termination of the conflict,

52:02.480 --> 52:04.800
and that, even though they knew they would lose,

52:04.800 --> 52:07.760
they are likely to continue fighting to the very end,

52:07.760 --> 52:09.520
merely to save face.

52:09.520 --> 52:13.280
So, the selection of this chap to head the diplomatic mission to Russia

52:13.280 --> 52:15.280
sends a clear message here.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.760
The Emperor wants the war over,

52:17.760 --> 52:21.520
and he wants to send Konoe to talk to Stalin to get it done.

52:21.520 --> 52:23.680
To prepare for the arrival of this mission,

52:23.680 --> 52:27.680
Togo messaged Sato to set up a meeting between Konoe and Stalin,

52:27.680 --> 52:30.800
and sent ahead the text of a message from the Emperor himself

52:30.800 --> 52:32.960
that Konoe was to bring with him.

52:32.960 --> 52:35.280
And this message reads as follows.

52:35.280 --> 52:36.960
"'His Majesty the Emperor,

52:36.960 --> 52:41.600
mindful of the fact that the present war daily brings greater evil and sacrifice

52:41.600 --> 52:44.080
upon the peoples of all the belligerent powers,

52:44.080 --> 52:48.240
desires from his heart that it may be quickly terminated.

52:48.240 --> 52:50.800
But so long as England and the United States

52:50.800 --> 52:52.880
insist upon unconditional surrender,

52:52.880 --> 52:57.280
the Japanese Empire has no alternative but to fight on with all its strength

52:57.360 --> 53:00.080
for the honor and existence of the Motherland.'"

53:00.080 --> 53:04.160
Now, Stalin got this message, but made no immediate response.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.960
He, too, was heading to the Potsdam Conference,

53:06.960 --> 53:09.360
and that's what we're going to talk about next.

53:09.360 --> 53:11.360
So, the Potsdam Conference took place

53:11.360 --> 53:14.800
between the 17th of July and the 2nd of August.

53:14.800 --> 53:17.360
Now, this conference was similar to the Yalta Conference

53:17.360 --> 53:20.400
in that it was a meeting of the leaders of the Soviet Union,

53:20.400 --> 53:22.560
United Kingdom, and United States

53:22.560 --> 53:27.120
to discuss various matters related to the post-war organization of Europe.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.840
However, in the time between the two conferences,

53:29.840 --> 53:32.320
a few important things had changed.

53:32.320 --> 53:33.840
Firstly, as we've mentioned,

53:33.840 --> 53:36.800
the US President and Secretary of State had changed,

53:36.800 --> 53:40.080
and Truman and Burns wanted a harder line on Russia.

53:40.080 --> 53:42.160
We don't need to get too deep into it here,

53:42.160 --> 53:44.400
but negotiations with the Soviet Union

53:44.400 --> 53:46.960
regarding various matters related to Europe

53:46.960 --> 53:49.120
had become increasingly difficult.

53:49.120 --> 53:51.840
Plus, the Nazis were out of the war by now,

53:51.840 --> 53:54.640
which meant there was less incentive for the other Allies

53:54.640 --> 53:57.040
to concede to Stalin's demands.

53:57.120 --> 54:01.280
Another important change was the completion of the Nuclear Bomb Project.

54:01.280 --> 54:05.680
The Trinity Test was conducted early in the morning on the 16th of July,

54:05.680 --> 54:08.240
just prior to the Potsdam Conference,

54:08.240 --> 54:09.920
and the test was a success.

54:09.920 --> 54:12.560
The Manhattan Project scientists demonstrated

54:12.560 --> 54:15.280
that they could detonate a nuclear bomb.

54:15.280 --> 54:17.600
Now, though the leadership of the United States

54:17.600 --> 54:21.200
had intended to get the Soviet Union into the war against Japan,

54:21.200 --> 54:22.720
all the things we just mentioned

54:22.720 --> 54:25.920
contributed to an important shift in opinion on that issue

54:25.920 --> 54:28.160
that was going on behind the scenes.

54:28.160 --> 54:31.920
And two diary entries written by President Truman at Potsdam

54:31.920 --> 54:34.320
make clear this shift in opinion.

54:34.320 --> 54:36.720
The first comes on the 17th of July,

54:36.720 --> 54:39.360
when Truman met Stalin for the first time,

54:39.360 --> 54:41.200
and they discussed various matters,

54:41.200 --> 54:43.920
including Russia's entry into the war against Japan.

54:44.480 --> 54:47.200
Truman's diary account of the conversation reports

54:47.200 --> 54:48.560
that Stalin will, quote,

54:48.560 --> 54:52.080
"...be in the Japanese War on August 15th."

54:52.080 --> 54:55.200
Finny the Japanese when that comes about,

54:55.200 --> 54:58.880
although Truman uses a free letter shorthand for Japanese

54:58.880 --> 55:02.480
that I won't repeat here on account of it being a racial slur.

55:02.480 --> 55:06.320
So the indication from this diary entry on the 17th of July

55:06.320 --> 55:10.080
is that Truman thinks that Japan is close to being finished off,

55:10.080 --> 55:14.560
and that Soviet entry into the war is what is going to do it.

55:14.560 --> 55:17.920
And he furthermore wrote a letter to his wife while at Potsdam,

55:17.920 --> 55:20.560
stating, "...I had gotten what I came for.

55:20.560 --> 55:24.640
Stalin goes to war on August 15th with no strings on it."

55:24.640 --> 55:28.240
And he goes on to mention how this means he thinks the war will be shorter

55:28.240 --> 55:30.960
and fewer lives will be lost as a result.

55:30.960 --> 55:36.000
So Truman seems positively enthusiastic about Soviet entry into the war right here,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.320
and it is interesting to note that Truman's belief

55:38.320 --> 55:41.840
that Japan will be finished off by a Soviet declaration of war

55:41.840 --> 55:46.960
means that he already thinks a US invasion of Japan is unnecessary.

55:46.960 --> 55:51.760
The second entry into Truman's diary I want to talk about comes the very next day.

55:51.760 --> 55:57.360
Now, Truman had been informed of the success of the Trinity test already on the 16th of July,

55:57.360 --> 56:00.560
but it's here on the 18th that he first gets an indication

56:00.560 --> 56:03.280
of just how powerful the atomic bomb was.

56:03.280 --> 56:07.040
Henry Stimson received a coded message describing an explosion

56:07.040 --> 56:09.520
that could be seen for hundreds of miles,

56:09.520 --> 56:12.400
and he relayed this to Truman, who he described as

56:12.400 --> 56:17.120
"...greatly reinforced and highly delighted upon hearing the news."

56:17.120 --> 56:21.280
And writing in this diary on this day, Truman says the following,

56:21.360 --> 56:25.360
"...believed the Japanese will fold up before Russia comes in.

56:25.360 --> 56:30.240
I am sure they will when Manhattan appears over their homeland."

56:30.240 --> 56:35.280
So here, Truman is presenting the bombs as an event that will preempt a Russian invasion

56:35.280 --> 56:39.040
as the thing that will cause the Japanese to fold up.

56:39.040 --> 56:41.600
This was an opinion shared by James Burns,

56:41.600 --> 56:45.760
who later wrote in his memoirs that, during the Potsdam Conference, quote,

56:45.760 --> 56:49.920
"...I would have been satisfied had the Russians determined not to enter the war.

56:49.920 --> 56:53.200
Notwithstanding Japan's persistent refusal to surrender,

56:53.200 --> 56:56.000
I believed the atomic bomb would be successful

56:56.000 --> 56:59.680
and would force the Japanese to accept surrender on our terms.

57:00.240 --> 57:04.480
I feared what would happen when the Red Army entered Manchuria."

57:04.480 --> 57:09.280
James Burns also rather candidly admitted in a post-war interview that, quote,

57:09.280 --> 57:12.640
"...it was ever-present in my mind that it was important

57:12.640 --> 57:15.840
that we have an end to the war before the Russians came in.

57:15.840 --> 57:19.760
Neither the president nor I were anxious to have them enter the war

57:19.760 --> 57:22.560
after we'd learned of this successful test."

57:22.560 --> 57:27.200
So here, Burns is directly tying the desire to keep the Russians out of the war

57:27.200 --> 57:29.840
to the news coming in from the Trinity test.

57:29.840 --> 57:33.680
And Walter Brown, who was assistant to James Burns at Potsdam,

57:33.680 --> 57:36.320
wrote in his diary on the 24th of July

57:36.320 --> 57:40.160
that Burns told him he believed that, after the atomic bomb was dropped,

57:40.160 --> 57:45.280
Japan will surrender and Russia will not get in so much on the kill.

57:45.280 --> 57:48.960
So the plan was to get Russia to invade Manchuria,

57:48.960 --> 57:51.280
something that would likely finish the war.

57:51.280 --> 57:53.680
But finishing the war with Russia's help

57:53.680 --> 57:58.480
does mean having to deal with Stalin being at the negotiating table afterwards.

57:58.480 --> 58:02.320
And given the difficulty of how the European negotiations are going,

58:02.320 --> 58:04.800
and how Roosevelt, God rest his soul,

58:04.800 --> 58:08.640
has already gone and promised Stalin a bunch of concessions for helping out,

58:09.280 --> 58:11.360
maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing

58:11.360 --> 58:14.960
if Russia ended up not being necessary here after all.

58:14.960 --> 58:17.840
And since the Trinity test was just a big success,

58:17.840 --> 58:21.520
we now have these very destructive nuclear bombs to play with.

58:21.520 --> 58:23.680
And maybe when we use these,

58:23.680 --> 58:27.120
Japan might surrender, to us specifically,

58:27.120 --> 58:29.680
before Russia even declares war.

58:29.680 --> 58:31.840
And wouldn't that be handy?

58:31.840 --> 58:36.560
And I'd like to point out two more things about this diary entry on July the 18th.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.160
The first is that Truman writes

58:38.160 --> 58:42.400
he believes the Japanese will fold up before Russia comes in.

58:42.400 --> 58:43.520
He does not write,

58:43.520 --> 58:48.720
I believe the Japanese will fold up before a US invasion of Japan is necessary.

58:48.720 --> 58:54.160
An invasion of Japan is already off the table here, as far as Truman is concerned.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.480
Truman and Barnes are not presenting the bombs

58:56.480 --> 59:00.800
as an alternative to a US invasion of Japan as a means to end the war.

59:00.800 --> 59:03.120
They are presenting the bombs as an alternative

59:03.120 --> 59:07.600
to a Soviet invasion of Manchuria as a means to end the war.

59:07.600 --> 59:10.640
The second thing I'd like to point out about this diary entry

59:10.640 --> 59:13.360
is that Truman writes the Japanese will fold up

59:13.360 --> 59:16.080
when Manhattan appears over their homeland.

59:16.080 --> 59:18.880
And that's when, not if.

59:18.880 --> 59:21.200
Truman writes about the use of the nuclear bombs

59:21.200 --> 59:24.160
as a thing that simply is going to happen,

59:24.160 --> 59:27.120
and then he speculates about the effects they will have.

59:27.120 --> 59:32.080
Nowhere here is the thought that the bombs might possibly not need to be used.

59:32.080 --> 59:34.480
As Truman later states in his memoirs,

59:34.480 --> 59:37.200
I regarded the bomb as a military weapon

59:37.200 --> 59:40.400
and never had any doubt that it should be used.

59:40.400 --> 59:44.480
And this is concerning in light of the fact that on July 18th,

59:44.480 --> 59:48.960
Truman learned of the message that the Kanoe mission was to deliver to Stalin.

59:48.960 --> 59:52.000
After meeting with Churchill, Truman notes in his diary

59:52.000 --> 59:56.240
that Stalin had told PM, that's Prime Minister Churchill,

59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.080
of telegram from the Japanese emperor asking for peace.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.360
Stalin also read his answer to me.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.280
It was satisfactory.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.560
As for what Stalin's satisfactory answer was,

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.280
we can read this account of Admiral Leahy's of a meeting ten days later.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.520
Stalin enlivened the proceedings by reporting that on July 18th,

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:22.880
he had received a request from Japan to mediate for them with the Allies to end the war.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.440
He said this request included a proposal

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.360
to send a royal prince of Japan to Moscow as chief of the mission.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.280
The Generalissimo said that his reply was that the proposal was too vague

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.480
to warrant his approving a meeting with the proposed mission.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.880
Stalin then says that he had that day received another message from Japan

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.520
attempting to clarify the purpose of the mission,

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.040
but that he was going to send the Japanese the same response.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.600
Leahy concludes that it was clearly evident that Stalin was at that time

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.080
determined to enter the war against Japan,

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.680
which plainly was to the advantage of Russia now that Japan was certain to be defeated.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.960
So Tokyo is sending messages to Stalin asking for him to mediate and enter the war,

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:10.560
and he's avoiding answering them directly and instead repeatedly asking for clarifications,

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.080
and he's clearly just buying time while he prepares for an invasion.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.640
More like Joseph Stalling.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.440
Anyway, to get back on track, President Truman knows at Potsdam

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.240
that the Japanese leadership are, in his words, asking for peace.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.600
So given that, why, we might wonder,

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.080
was there no doubt in Truman's mind about the need to set off nuclear bombs

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.800
in the middle of civilian population centers?

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:42.000
Now, we could simply say that Truman had resolved to drop the atomic bomb on civilians

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.680
in order to force a Japanese surrender on favorable terms

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.960
before the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.320
However, this interpretation of events seemingly conflicts

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.480
with another diary entry that Truman wrote on the 25th of July,

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.600
when, talking about the upcoming bombings, he says,

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.240
This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10th.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.120
I have told the Secretary of War, Mr. Stimson,

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.400
to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target,

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.800
and not women and children.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.560
He and I are in accord.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.760
The target will be a purely military one.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.000
So, what's going on here?

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.560
Truman states in this diary entry

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.560
that the bomb is going to be used against a purely military target.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.440
Now, by no stretch of the imagination

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.320
can the middle of a civilian population center

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.200
be considered a purely military target.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.080
It is, in fact, the exact place you would drop the bomb

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.960
if you were trying to target women and children.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.480
If the middle of a city counts as a purely military target,

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.560
then there is nowhere the bomb could be dropped

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.360
that would not count as a purely military target,

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.480
making the question of whether to drop it on a purely military target or not completely pointless.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.640
And he's talking to Henry Stimson,

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.320
who, of course, knows the bomb is going to be dropped on a city,

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.400
but has apparently tricked himself into believing the lazy euphemism

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:12.320
about a war plant surrounded by workers' houses being a purely military target.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.680
Truman and Stimson are acting like the bomb is going to be dropped

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.400
on a military base or an airfield or something,

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.880
and then patting themselves on the back for not dropping it on civilians.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.760
For whatever reason, Truman is thinking about the bomb

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.960
as though it is only going to affect enemy soldiers.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.720
He seems to understand that it would be wrong to drop the bomb on civilians,

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.840
but not that that is exactly what is about to happen.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:40.720
As for why this is, there are three possible explanations that I can imagine.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:45.520
The first is that Truman genuinely thinks the bomb is not going to be dropped on civilians

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.360
and that the target list only includes military bases or something.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.160
In this version of events, Truman is told by Stimson

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.600
that the bomb is going to be dropped on a purely military target,

01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.800
believes him, and is later surprised by the fact the bombs have actually been dropped on civilians.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.240
And so he orders that no more nuclear bombs should be dropped without his express permission,

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.560
which is something he did do after the second bomb was dropped, by the way.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.920
Then I guess he realizes that he's massively screwed up,

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.440
but decides to just run with it and pretend that was the plan all along,

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.440
because that's easier at that point than admitting the enormous incompetence

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:27.120
and being like, sorry, I didn't actually mean to blow up two cities, that's my bad.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.040
The second explanation is that Truman is simply deluding himself.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:36.000
He knows exactly what the target is, but he's convincing himself it's something else.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.240
If he really thought about it, he'd know that the bomb was not going to land on a purely military target,

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.440
so he's not thinking about it, and he's deceiving himself.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.320
The third explanation I can imagine is that Truman is just consciously lying.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:54.400
He knows the bomb is not going to be dropped on a purely military target,

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.200
but he's falsely claiming that that is what he believes at this point in time.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.200
And I suppose this could have been done with an eye on his place in the history books,

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.600
or to protect himself if there was any significant repercussions after the bombs,

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.440
then he could have pointed to this and claimed,

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.680
hey, I ordered them to be dropped on military targets, you can't pin this on me.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.600
All these options are just speculation on my part, however.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.920
If I was forced to guess, I'd say he was probably deceiving himself,

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.040
but I do not know the actual reason why Truman wrote

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:28.480
that the bombs were only going to be used on military targets.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.640
I only know that for whatever reason. When he wrote that, he was wrong.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.240
Now, leaving the nuclear bombs to the side for a moment,

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.040
I wouldn't blame someone for asking at this point.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:44.880
If Truman and Burns are apparently so anxious to get the war over with before the Russians get involved,

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.480
and they knew at Potsdam that the Emperor was asking for peace,

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.560
why was peace not able to be negotiated sooner than it was?

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.200
Why, when they heard the Emperor wanted peace,

01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.800
did they not simply send him a message saying, great, okay, let's negotiate peace?

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.960
And the answer to that is the deadlock over unconditional surrender.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:09.760
As we know, Japan was committed to avoiding an unconditional surrender,

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.120
but Truman was likewise committed to securing one.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.920
He didn't want to accept what the Japanese were offering, which was a negotiated peace.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.520
He wanted a full unconditional surrender.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.920
Now, various individuals within the Allied governments and armed forces

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:30.000
understood that insisting on absolute unconditional surrender was,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.040
particularly with regards to the question of the Emperor,

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.640
going to cause problems and possibly prolong the war.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.760
While at the Yalta Conference, Winston Churchill suggested that mitigating the terms of surrender,

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:47.120
quote, would be worthwhile if it led to the saving of a year or a year and a half of war

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.240
in which so much blood and treasure would be poured out.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.960
But President Roosevelt was unreceptive to Churchill's suggestion.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:00.000
Not to be deterred, however, Churchill tried again when talking to Truman at Potsdam,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.640
and he later gave an account of the conversation.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.840
I dwelt upon the tremendous cost in American life and to a smaller extent in British life,

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.240
which would be involved in forcing unconditional surrender upon the Japanese.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.400
It was for him to consider whether this might not be expressed in some other way,

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.760
so that we got all the essentials for future peace and security,

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.360
and yet left the Japanese some show of saving their military honor

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.160
and some assurance of their national existence.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.640
However, Churchill found this president as unreceptive as the last.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:34.080
Truman, quote, countered by saying that he did not think the Japanese

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.800
had any military honor after Pearl Harbor.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.440
But Churchill responded that, at any rate,

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.000
they had something for which they were ready to face certain death in very large numbers,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.440
and this might not be so important to us as to them.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.400
Others attempted to influence Truman on the unconditional surrender issue at various times,

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.760
sometimes seemingly having more luck than Churchill there.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:00.400
Under Secretary of State Joseph Grew, who understood the importance of the emperor

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:05.760
having been US ambassador to Japan for a decade, advised Truman on the 28th of May

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:09.520
that the greatest obstacle to unconditional surrender by the Japanese

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.000
is their belief that this would entail the destruction

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.920
or permanent removal of the emperor and the institution of the throne.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.320
And Grew goes on to say that without an assurance

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.800
that the imperial institution would not be destroyed,

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.920
a Japanese surrender would be highly unlikely.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.840
And he further notes that the president said that he was interested in what I said

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.040
because his own thoughts had been following the same line.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.000
Another of Truman's advisors who took a similar line was Secretary of War Henry Stimson,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.080
who spoke to Truman on the 2nd of July

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:41.440
on the issue of drafting surrender terms for Japan, stating that

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.800
"...I personally think that if we should add that we do not exclude

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.920
a constitutional monarchy under her present dynasty,

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.960
it would substantially add to the chances of acceptance."

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.160
And Stimson later wrote in his diary that Truman was, quote,

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.880
"...apparently acquiescent with my attitude towards the treatment of Japan."

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.760
Now, I think there's two possibilities here.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.400
The first is that President Harry S. Truman

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.880
was one of those intensely annoying people

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.200
who simply agree with whatever the last person they spoke to said to them,

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.560
showing absolutely no respect for future historians

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.000
attempting to figure out what they actually thought about anything.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.800
The second is that Truman was actually sympathetic

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.120
to what his advisors were advising him

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.920
with regards to softening unconditional surrender,

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.040
but there was some other influence preventing him from acting on that advice.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.960
And we perhaps see a hint of this at a meeting on the 18th of June,

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.520
when this time, Admiral Leahy tried his luck

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.320
at pushing for a softening of unconditional surrender,

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.440
stating that "...our insistence on unconditional surrender

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.320
would result only in making the Japanese desperate

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.280
and thereby increase our casualty lists."

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.880
And Truman responded that

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.080
"...he did not feel that he could take any action at this time

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.880
to change public opinion on the matter."

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.880
So, the opinion of the public

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.680
is being factored into the decision-making process

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.000
regarding Japanese surrender terms.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.560
And I think it's fair to say that the United States public

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.360
were not the biggest fans of Emperor Hirohito.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.480
A Gallup poll conducted on the 29th of June reported

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.840
that when asked what the fate of the Emperor should be after the war,

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.920
the most popular response was,

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.200
"...execute him."

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.240
So any US president with an eye on public opinion

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.920
is in a bit of a tricky position

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.520
when it comes to openly telling Japan they can keep their emperor,

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.760
especially if said US president

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.200
has a history of calling for unconditional surrender.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.000
Just about the only person not advising Truman

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.720
to soften the surrender terms was James Burns,

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.960
who will later rather dramatically state

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.400
that Truman appearing to back down from unconditional surrender

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.760
would lead to the crucifixion of the president.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.760
All of this is complicated by the fact that behind the scenes,

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.840
the leadership of the Allied military

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.640
did not desire to get rid of the Emperor.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.520
In fact, there was actually a pressing military reason

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.040
to retain the Emperor.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.600
And to quote a meeting of the Combined Chiefs of Staff

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.840
that took place on the 16th of July

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.000
when discussing unconditional surrender,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.360
it was suggested that,

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.320
"...if, for instance, an interpretation could be found

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.160
and communicated to the Japanese

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.000
which did not involve the dissolution of the Imperial Institution,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.960
the Emperor would be in a position to order the ceasefire

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.240
in outlying areas,

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.560
whereas if the dynasty were destroyed,

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.040
the outlying garrisons might continue to fight

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.960
for many months or years."

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.000
So the proposal here is to leave the Emperor in place

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.920
and use his influence to convince

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.800
the scattered Japanese troops to stand down,

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.440
whereas if they simply kill or imprison the Emperor,

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.760
that might prompt the troops to fight on.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.040
So Truman's being pulled in different directions here.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.800
Strictly militarily speaking,

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.520
letting Japan keep the Emperor makes a lot of sense.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.760
It will almost certainly shorten the war,

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.560
save lives,

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.760
and be the thing to convince the Japanese military to give up.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.800
Conveying that message to the Japanese leadership

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.400
prior to their surrender, though,

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.080
is potentially risky from a domestic political standpoint.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.600
If you've previously been calling for unconditional surrender,

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.400
you don't want to be seen as reversing position on that

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.760
and giving in to a hated enemy's demands.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.360
However, the threat of the Soviet Union's expansion into Asia

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.000
means you do want to end the war quickly.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.480
So there's conflicting motivations here,

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.360
and these conflicting motivations came to influence

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.240
the construction of the Potsdam Declaration.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.320
Now, this was a statement issued by the Allies on the 26th of July

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.440
that called for the unconditional surrender of Japan,

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.080
saying,

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.720
"...we call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.080
the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.960
and to provide proper and adequate assurances

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.360
of their good faith in such action."

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.360
The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction,

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.280
and it laid out various terms,

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.640
such as the occupation of Japanese territory by the Allies,

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.040
the disarming of the Japanese military,

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.000
and so on.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.120
Notably, however,

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.280
the Potsdam Declaration did not contain any mention of the Emperor,

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.120
which you might think is rather odd,

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.680
given that the Allies clearly know how important

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.760
the question of the Imperial Institution was to the Japanese leadership.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.280
However, it did state that

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.960
"...the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:22.000
the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.800
must be eliminated for all time."

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.040
And this is rather vague with respect to exactly who it means.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.920
Does the Emperor count as one of those who have misled the people of Japan?

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.960
When the Japanese leadership received the Potsdam Declaration,

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.680
the hardliners on the Supreme Council interpreted this in a very unfavorable way

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:45.600
and took it to be an indirect threat to the Emperor's life.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.240
Another confusing point for the Japanese leadership

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.800
was that when the Potsdam Declaration was issued,

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.960
it was signed by the United States,

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.760
Britain,

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.480
China,

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.400
and, interestingly,

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.480
not the Soviet Union.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.520
To the Supreme Council, this inspired a question,

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.520
as well as a fair bit of false hope.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.600
If the Soviet Union didn't sign this declaration,

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.280
does that mean that they possibly disagree with the declaration?

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.520
What is Russia's position here?

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.520
Since they didn't sign the document calling for our unconditional surrender,

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.160
does that mean they might be open to negotiating better terms for us after all?

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:27.120
After receiving the Potsdam Declaration, Togo met with the Emperor to discuss it.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.320
The Emperor thought that the terms of the declaration were, quote,

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.480
"...acceptable in principle,"

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:38.240
but he agreed to postpone a response until after they had heard back from the Soviet Union.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.640
So Togo sent a message to Ambassador Sato on the 28th of July

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:49.120
with instructions to attempt to sound out the Russian attitude towards the joint declaration.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.320
Ambassador Sato, for his part, had had just about enough of this nonsense.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.080
He had been repeatedly saying that the Russia plan was not going to work,

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:02.000
and yet here's another message from Tokyo postponing surrender

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.520
in order to ask what the situation is with the Russians.

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:09.120
Sato's messages in response were openly insubordinate

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.640
and strayed into brazenly telling Tokyo what to do.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.760
Sato said, and I'm paraphrasing here,

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:20.320
"...look, if Stalin disagreed with the terms of the Potsdam Declaration,

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.360
he would have negotiated better terms at the time.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.640
And if he wasn't able to negotiate better terms at the time,

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.440
he's not going to be able to do that now, is he?

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.560
The Soviet Union is not going to help you.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.600
In fact, if you don't immediately surrender, they are probably going to declare war on you."

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:44.400
The Supreme Council, on receiving these messages, finally saw sense and decided to end the war.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.320
No, I'm joking, Sato was ignored, obviously.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.040
So the Potsdam Declaration contained no direct information about the fate of the Emperor,

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.400
and it left open the question of the Soviet Union's position,

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.520
which prompted the Japanese leadership to postpone a response until they knew what that was.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.520
Until then, their official position was to ignore the declaration.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.040
So if the Potsdam Declaration was intended to produce a surrender from Japan, it failed.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.240
However, when the Potsdam Declaration was first drafted

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:19.440
by the Office of Secretary of War Henry Stimson, it included the following point.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.520
"...the occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.840
as soon as our objectives are accomplished and there has been established beyond doubt

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:34.000
a peacefully inclined responsible government of a character representative of the Japanese people.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.120
This may include a constitutional monarchy under the present dynasty."

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:43.840
So that is a concrete offer to retain the imperial institution right there.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:49.120
And earlier drafts of the Potsdam Declaration also included among the signatories

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.840
the generalissimo of the Soviet Union.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.960
So, what happened here then?

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:59.760
Well, between the first draft leaving Stimson's office and it being issued publicly,

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.880
the Potsdam Declaration went through various drafts.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:09.040
Most importantly for us here, the document was edited by President Truman and James Burns.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:14.400
The final draft, of course, saw the Soviet Union being removed from the list of signatories

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.000
and the offer to retain the imperial institution deleted.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.480
Firstly, on the issue of the Soviet Union being removed from the declaration,

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.360
President Truman simply writes in his memoirs that

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.200
"...Stalin could not, of course, be a party to the proclamation itself

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.760
since he was still at peace with Japan."

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:37.200
So that's Truman's stated reason for excluding the Soviet Union from the declaration.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.760
The Soviet Union is not yet in the war

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.960
and technically still has a non-aggression pact in place with Japan.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.960
But why, we might ask, does this mean that the Soviet Union

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.480
can't sign a document calling for Japan to surrender?

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.840
I mean, Truman's stated intent for going to Potsdam

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.680
was to convince the Russians to violate that non-aggression pact

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.200
and have their military attack the Japanese military.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.080
So I'm going to go ahead and assume that respect for the sanctity of non-aggression pacts

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.920
is clearly not the reason here.

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.720
And if Truman is implying that he was worried that the Soviet Union signing the document

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.120
would lead to war between Russia and Japan,

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.480
well, that's what he's supposed to want to happen.

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:22.800
In fact, the Soviet Union's exclusion from the final draft of the document

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.040
came as an enormous surprise to the delegation from the Soviet Union,

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.840
who had written their own draft of the Potsdam Declaration,

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.120
which included themselves as signatories.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.720
So they clearly wanted in on the signing of the document.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.360
Instead, the Soviet delegation was not consulted about the drafting of the declaration

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:44.160
and were only told it was being released to the press

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.280
at the same time it was being released to the press.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.080
Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Molotov

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.000
submitted a request to delay the publication of the declaration,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.360
but James Burns claimed he didn't get the message in time.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.420
Hmm.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:03.920
As for why the Soviet Union wanted to be included among the list of signatories,

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.320
Stalin and Molotov wanted a pretext

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:10.400
to abandon their non-aggression pact with Japan and invade Manchuria.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:15.680
And the Potsdam Declaration's ultimatum to Japan would have provided that pretext.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.480
So, after being edited out of the declaration, they tried a more direct approach.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.720
In a meeting on the 29th of July,

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:26.400
Molotov submitted a request from Stalin for the United States,

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.320
England, and the other Allies, quote,

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:34.000
to address a formal request to the Soviet government for its entry into the war.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.520
Now, this put Truman and Burns in a very awkward position,

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.320
because, of course, they're supposed to want the Soviet government to enter the war,

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.560
but they clearly don't anymore.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.880
As Burns later wrote in his memoirs,

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.640
"...we had, of course, begun to hope a Japanese surrender might be imminent,

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.400
and we did not want to urge the Russians to enter the war."

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.600
Truman and Burns figure they just have to wait a week or so

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.680
for the first nuclear bomb to be dropped,

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:05.680
and then Japan will surrender before the Soviet Union has a chance to declare war and invade.

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:10.400
So being asked directly for an invitation to the war put Truman on the spot,

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.560
and he sidestepped the issue.

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.520
The Soviets will get no invitation from him.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.160
However, an interesting note here is that

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.360
when the Soviet Union does actually declare war on Japan,

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.440
they say they have acceded to the Allied request to join the war.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.840
So they didn't get an invitation, but they just acted like they did anyway.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.680
Now, of course, excluding the Soviets from the Potsdam Declaration

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:36.640
and dodging their request for an invitation to join the war

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.800
confirmed to Stalin that Truman was planning to finish the war without him.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:46.560
So while at Potsdam, Stalin ordered his generals to speed up their invasion plans.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.520
He wasn't going to be left out of the kill.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:54.800
So I think it's fairly clear why the Soviet Union was excluded from the Potsdam Declaration.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.400
Burns and Truman are planning to finish the war without Stalin,

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.880
and that includes not having Stalin's signature on the surrender papers.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:09.440
So when Japan surrenders, it will not be, in any way, a surrender to the Soviet Union, is the plan.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.080
The second important added to the Potsdam Declaration

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:15.520
was the removal of the offer to retain the Imperial Institution.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:20.640
And the reasoning for this change is found in the diary of Henry Stimson, who writes that,

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:24.800
"...when the Potsdam conditions were drawn and left my office where they originated,

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:29.840
they contained a provision which permitted the continuance of the dynasty with certain conditions.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.120
The President and Burns struck that out.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.080
They were not obdurate on it, but they thought they could arrange it

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:41.280
in the necessary secret negotiations which would take place after any armistice."

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.920
So Truman and Burns think the position of the Emperor is a matter to be negotiated

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.560
after Japan has already surrendered.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.280
And they're both convinced that the nuclear bomb

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.880
is definitely about to force an unconditional surrender from Japan.

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.560
Remember that Truman is, quote,

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.600
"...sure that Japan will surrender when Manhattan appears over their homeland."

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:05.440
So given that, why should they make any concessions beforehand

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.680
and risk an unnecessary backlash?

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:11.760
Truman and Burns plan to use the bomb to make Japan surrender unconditionally

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.560
before Russia joins the war, and anything else,

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.880
like the position of the Emperor, can simply be sorted out afterwards.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:22.400
So here's the situation we're in at the end of the Potsdam Conference.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:26.880
The Japanese leadership is still refusing to accept an unconditional surrender,

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.680
but Truman is refusing to accept anything less,

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.880
even though on the principle point, the fate of the Emperor,

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.320
both sides are in agreement.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.320
They don't want to get rid of the Emperor.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:40.560
But since neither side wanted to blink first, the deadlock remained.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:44.480
Japan waited for rescue from the Soviet Union that would never come,

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.760
and the United States moved forward with the atomic bombings.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.480
The first atomic bomb was dropped in the center of Hiroshima on August 6th

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.720
at about 8.15 in the morning.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.360
It exploded directly above a hospital, immediately killing everyone inside.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.360
Within the immediate blast radius were the Honkawa and Fukuromachi Elementary Schools,

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:09.840
which were completely destroyed, instantly incinerating hundreds of schoolchildren.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.000
This is the purely military target right here.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.440
Now my video is about the reasons why these bombs were dropped,

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.000
not the actual explosions themselves.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.280
There are many sources for first-hand accounts of the terrifying effects of the atomic bomb,

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.800
and you can look those up yourself if you're in a particularly good mood today

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.160
and would like to ruin it.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.200
I'll just say here that tens of thousands of civilians,

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.280
including thousands of schoolchildren,

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.080
were killed, permanently injured, and disfigured

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.720
in a number of cruel and horrible ways.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.360
Many of those not killed by the initial blast

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.080
also suffered the effects of radiation poisoning,

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.040
which killed and made seriously sick many more people.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.280
Altogether, between the two atomic bombs,

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:57.440
it's estimated that between 129,000 and 226,000 people were killed,

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.560
and the vast majority of these were innocent civilians.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.200
This is particularly true in the case of Nagasaki,

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.200
where it is estimated that of the tens of thousands of people who were killed,

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.160
only 150 of them were soldiers.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:15.440
When the leadership of Japan got news of the Hiroshima bomb, they discussed what to do.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.520
Foreign Minister Togo saw in the bomb a chance to end the war,

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.240
and he argued at a meeting on the 7th of August

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.480
that Japan should now accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.760
He was ignored.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.720
The militarists on the council were too far gone at this point

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.920
to be shaken by the destruction of just one more city.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.560
War Minister Anami, after hearing the news,

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.280
said, "...I am convinced that the Americans had only one bomb after all."

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.600
Even after the destruction of Hiroshima,

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.040
Anami and the other militarists remained committed to pursuing a negotiated peace.

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.480
Togo met with the Emperor the next day, on August 8th,

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.080
and they both agreed that the war was lost and they should surrender.

01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.000
But even these two, who have both wanted peace for a long time now,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.120
are still thinking at this point about the possibility of negotiating a peace.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:09.360
Togo stated after the war that while he and the Emperor wanted to end the war,

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.680
quote, "...as soon as possible,"

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.040
they would not completely discard the possibility of negotiating conditions.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.160
Armed with the Emperor's wish that the war should be ended,

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:23.680
Togo called a meeting of the Supreme Council for the direction of the war

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.480
to be held the next day, as some ministers were unavailable.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.320
And I'd like to comment on two incredibly frustrating things here.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.400
First is obviously that the Japanese leadership did not unanimously

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.040
and immediately unconditionally surrender.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.080
The militarists were still conning themselves into thinking

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:46.640
they would get to force favorable terms by fighting against an Allied invasion.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:52.960
The second incredibly frustrating thing is just how amazingly slowly this process is going.

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.360
Hiroshima was bombed on August 6th.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.800
Togo's advice to surrender was ignored on August 7th.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.400
He met with the Emperor to discuss what to do on August 8th,

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.600
and then called the Supreme Council meeting to discuss things further on August 9th,

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.640
because some ministers weren't available sooner.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.040
What were they doing?

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.080
They had something more important to do, clearly.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.280
Where were they?

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.440
If Truman and Burns had intended the bomb

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.640
to immediately shock the Japanese leadership out of the war,

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.880
they severely miscalculated.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.200
The militarists heard of the destruction of Hiroshima, and they shrugged.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.440
It was just one more bombed city.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.760
They'd seen dozens of those already.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:39.840
The Emperor and the less unwise members of the council desired peace as they had before,

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.920
but despite claims they wanted to end the war as quickly as possible,

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.160
they too were moving in slow motion.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.680
There is an arrogant lack of urgency here.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.640
The Emperor isn't ordering an end to the war here.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:58.080
He's simply letting it be known, again, that he thinks ending the war is desirable,

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.440
and asking Togo to pass the message on to the Supreme Council

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:05.120
once they get back off their holidays or wherever it was they went.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.800
More than a full day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima,

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.880
Ambassador Sato in Moscow received the following message from Tokyo.

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:15.600
The situation is becoming more and more pressing,

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:19.360
and we would like to know at once the explicit attitude of the Russians.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.640
So will you put forth still greater efforts to get a reply from them in haste?

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.640
Upon reading this, I picture Sato justifiably imagining himself

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.800
doing various types of violence to the members of the Supreme Council.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.360
Sato wouldn't have to wait long to find out, as though he needed to,

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.840
the explicit attitude of the Russians.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.440
Molotov summoned Sato to the Kremlin on August 8th

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:48.160
and handed him the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan,

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.520
and you rarely have to feel for the poor bastard at this point.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:55.120
He warned them this was coming, and they didn't listen.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.880
The Soviet army crossed the border into Japanese-occupied Manchuria

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.600
near midnight on the 8th of August and began smashing apart the Japanese defenses.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:09.440
Because their leadership had refused to accept the inevitable reality of an imminent Russian invasion,

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:14.160
the underequipped Japanese troops were not prepared for or expecting a fight,

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.920
and they were quickly overwhelmed.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:19.200
When the news of the Soviet declaration of war reached Tokyo,

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.120
Prime Minister Suzuki met with Cabinet Secretary Sakomizu,

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.440
and after discussing the news, came to the conclusion that their only two options

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.000
were either to declare war on the Soviet Union and fight to certain death,

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.360
or they could accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.120
Suzuki met with the Emperor early in the morning on the 9th of August,

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.920
and the Emperor agreed to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration,

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.120
a meeting of the Supreme Council, was called.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:50.800
The six members of the council met to discuss their upcoming surrender

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.920
and immediately deadlocked again.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:56.480
I sound like a broken record here, I know,

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.080
but the moderate faction supported accepting the Potsdam Declaration

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.680
with the singular condition that the Imperial Institution be protected,

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:08.160
and the militarist faction supported accepting it only if they got to keep the Emperor,

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.000
do their own war crimes trials,

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.080
remain free of foreign occupation,

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.680
everyone gets a pony,

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.360
the army gets Fridays off now, etc.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.840
Hours into this ridiculous conversation,

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.720
a messenger arrives to announce that Nagasaki had just been hit with a nuclear bomb.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.040
Now, if anyone expects this news to have any impact whatsoever

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.280
upon the impasse in the Supreme Council,

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:35.280
I have done a very poor job of explaining what the Supreme Council is like.

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:39.760
The bombing of Nagasaki, of course, had no effect whatsoever.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.760
The council remained deadlocked.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.280
They spoke for hours.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.520
They upgraded to a full government cabinet meeting with 16 members.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.080
They spoke for hours again in that meeting.

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.600
No conclusion was reached, and they broke for dinner.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:58.800
Now, I wouldn't blame anyone for considering this a very unlikely sequence of events.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.280
How could they be hit with two nuclear bombs

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:04.000
and that still not be enough to break this deadlock?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.840
And the answer to that is they, the Supreme Council,

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.720
haven't been hit with any nuclear bombs.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.640
Some unimportant peasants somewhere have been hit with nuclear bombs.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.600
The council are fine. They don't care.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.880
This brings us back to one of the failures of morale bombing.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:26.080
Totalitarian, militaristic regimes don't give a toss about their citizens.

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:29.120
You can't frighten them by killing poor people.

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.800
That's their day job.

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.320
At one or other of these council meetings prior to the end of the war,

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:39.600
Chief of the Army General Staff Umezu was asked about Japan's defense against atomic bombs,

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.560
and he replied,

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.800
So that's the militarist position on the bombs stated pretty clearly there.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.160
They don't really care.

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.520
The nuclear bombs were no reason to surrender.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:09.680
This impasse in the council did need to be broken somehow, though.

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:14.080
So Suzuki, Togo, and Sakomizu met in the Prime Minister's office

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:18.000
and hatched a plan to have the Emperor himself resolve the argument

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.480
with a sacred royal judgment, something which was highly unusual.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:27.200
The Emperor was not supposed to get involved in affairs of state so directly.

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.560
To achieve this, they had to call an imperial conference.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.240
So Suzuki went to the Emperor to request that one be called,

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:39.040
a request which was granted immediately, which is very shocking for this lot.

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.000
I'm surprised they didn't take a week off to think about it.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.680
At this imperial conference, the members of the Supreme Council

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:49.840
immediately deadlocked along the same lines as all the previous meetings.

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:51.920
Their arguments were the same as before.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:55.280
The militarists wanted to insist on attaching multiple conditions

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:57.600
to their offer to accept the Potsdam Declaration,

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:02.160
and the moderates wanted to attach only one, the preservation of the Emperor.

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:06.240
They talked until past 2 a.m. in the morning when Prime Minister Suzuki,

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.280
talking over the protests of War Minister Onami,

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:13.520
dared to ask the Emperor directly what he wanted to do.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:18.080
The Emperor said he agreed with the moderates, and this intervention did the trick.

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:21.440
Japan would offer to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration,

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:26.160
with the understanding that said declaration does not comprise any demand

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:30.800
which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.720
Truman and his advisors got the message that morning on the 10th of August,

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.360
and they gathered to discuss their response.

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.560
Admiral Leahy thought that the condition should be accepted.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.240
He argued that the matter of the Emperor's position was a trivial one

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.240
compared to passing up an opportunity to bring an end to the war.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.400
Secretary Stimson likewise thought the condition should be accepted,

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.480
and he also notes in his diary,

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.520
"...in my opinion, with a slightly sarcastic tone,

01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:02.640
it is curious that this was the very single point that I figured would make trouble."

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:06.160
And then he talks about his earlier draft of the Potsdam Declaration,

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.600
which included an offer to retain the Imperial Institution,

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.200
the very thing that was now delaying the end of the war.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.200
If Stimson managed not to say,

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.560
"...I told you so,"

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.120
then he's a more disciplined man than I.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.600
In support of accepting the Japanese condition,

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:26.240
Stimson argued that the United States wanted to keep the Emperor anyway.

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:30.640
They needed to use his power to convince the Japanese military to stand down.

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:34.000
Stimson was also aware that time was a factor here.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
The Soviet Army was on the march,

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.520
and he thought that the war with Japan needed to be ended quickly

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.200
before the Russians were able to reach the Japanese homeland.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.760
James Burns, on the other hand, said,

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.560
"...no, we should not accept this condition.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:53.680
I do not see why we should retreat from our demand for unconditional surrender," he said.

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.760
"...If any conditions are to be accepted,

01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:00.080
I want the United States and not Japan to state the conditions."

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:03.280
That was his account of his words from his memoirs there.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:07.840
So the conditions, to the unconditional surrender, work that out,

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.680
should be coming from us here.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:13.760
They lost the war, why do they get to say the conditions?

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:16.320
We won, we say the conditions.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.320
A justification for Burns' position is found in Stimson's diary,

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.440
where he writes that,

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.360
"...Burns was troubled and anxious to find out whether we could accept this

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:29.520
in light of some of the public statements by Roosevelt and Truman.

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.840
Of course, during three years of a bitter war,

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.800
there have been bitter statements made about the Emperor.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.880
Now they come to plague us."

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.000
So according to Stimson, Burns is again worried here

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.400
about the public perception of backing away from unconditional surrender.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.880
We've been calling the Emperor a monstrous dictator for the last three years,

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:52.880
and now we're gonna let him off the hook because he told us to?

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.400
That's not gonna play.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.000
So Truman and his advisors came up with a compromise position.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.120
They would send a note to Japan, written by Burns,

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.960
intending to imply, without stating it so directly,

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.840
that Japan would be allowed to keep the Emperor.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.280
The note stated that,

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.440
"...the Emperor shall issue his commands to all the Japanese military,

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.360
naval, and air authorities,

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.880
and to all the forces under their control wherever located,

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.640
to cease active operations and to surrender their arms,

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:27.200
and to issue such other orders as the Supreme Commander may require

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.520
to give effect to the surrender terms."

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.960
So they're giving the Emperor a list of jobs, basically.

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:35.600
They're implying that he gets to stay around

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.880
by laying out what his role is going to be going forward.

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.040
And the note also states that,

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.840
"...the ultimate form of government of Japan shall,

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.160
in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration,

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.720
be established by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people."

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.280
Truman sums up the intended aim of the Burns note in his diary when he says,

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:58.560
"...they wanted to make a condition precedent to the surrender.

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.800
They wanted to keep the Emperor.

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.360
We told him we'd tell him how to keep him, but we'd make the terms."

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.560
So what's happened here is the United States said to Japan,

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.960
"...we demand you surrender unconditionally."

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.160
And Japan responded,

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:15.040
"...we will gladly accept unconditional surrender

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.920
on the condition that you first agree to this condition to that unconditional surrender."

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.840
To which the United States responded,

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:25.440
"...oh, we will happily agree to this condition to the unconditional surrender

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.960
on the condition that you agree that you're accepting the condition,

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.120
not that we are accepting the condition.

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:35.760
You're keeping the Emperor because we want that, not because you want that.

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:36.880
So there."

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:39.920
When the Japanese leadership received the Burns note,

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.040
well, we all know how this goes by now, don't we?

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.360
There was yet another stalemate.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.760
They disagreed over its exact meaning.

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:53.920
There were arguments, plots, threats, proposed possible revisions to the note.

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:58.480
Prime Minister Suzuki swapped sides for a bit and then swapped back again.

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.160
None of this matters at all.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.520
They're just wasting time not accomplishing anything.

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.760
After several days of this nonsense,

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:09.920
the Emperor intervened to break the stalemate... again.

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:14.240
On August 14th, the Emperor summoned his cabinet to an Imperial conference,

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.000
listened once more to the tedious arguments of the militarists,

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.040
and responded that he had not changed his mind and still wanted to end the war.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:29.440
This second direct intervention finally mercifully brought about a surrender.

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:33.040
Japan would accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.440
At 12 midday on August 15th,

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:41.200
the Emperor broadcast by public radio an address announcing that the war was over.

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:45.360
Now around this time, there was a coup attempt organized by some junior officers

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.040
in the Japanese military trying to prevent Japan's surrender,

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:53.760
but they failed to gain support of the military leadership and it quickly fizzled out.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.800
War Minister Anami refused to support the coup,

01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.160
choosing instead to go home and commit suicide.

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.880
And though the war with the other allies was over,

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:08.960
Stalin stepped up his offensive against the Japanese-occupied territories he wished to capture.

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.920
Surrender or no surrender, Stalin was going to take what he felt he was owed.

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:17.600
And Russia's annexing, for instance, of several of the Kuril Islands

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:21.040
led to a dispute over ownership that is still going on today,

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.680
with both Japan and Russia arguing over who has sovereignty of the islands,

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:28.080
when, really, it should be neither of them.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:32.640
There were already people on those islands before either Russia or Japan turned up.

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.840
Other than that though, the Second World War was over.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.200
Just about.

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.600
Now, with regards to our main topic today, we can ask a question.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:46.320
What effect did the nuclear bombs have on Japan's decision to end the war?

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.920
Well, Japan needed three main things, I would argue, in order to end the war.

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:57.280
Firstly, they had to be in a hopeless military situation with no chance of winning the war

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.960
and be aware of that.

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.240
And this one we can tick off.

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.760
The Japanese leadership knew it had no chance to actually defeat the allies militarily.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.000
They had known that for quite a while.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.440
Their only hope for their military was to use whatever was left of it

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.520
to drag out the war with the hopes of securing better peace terms for themselves.

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:21.440
Secondly, Japan had to be in a hopeless diplomatic situation and be aware of that.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Now, ever since the Russians signed the secret pact to declare war on Japan at the Yalta Conference,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.920
the Japanese government was in a hopeless diplomatic situation.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:35.520
But for a long time, they didn't understand that they were.

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.960
They held out hope for Russian mediation all the way until the Soviet Union declared war on them.

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.360
Now, some of the actions of the Allies undoubtedly contributed to Japan

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.840
not understanding the position they were in,

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:51.600
principal among those probably being the Soviet Union's signature

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:54.080
being struck off the Potsdam Declaration.

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:59.280
But we also can't ignore the capacity for willful ignorance and self-deception

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.600
among the members of the Japanese leadership.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.840
They should have known their situation was hopeless.

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:09.200
After the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, however,

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.280
the Japanese leadership finally understood this second point.

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.760
And I'd like to add something here.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.240
The strategic bombing survey that I mentioned at the start of the video stated,

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.160
Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped,

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.320
even if Russia had not entered the war,

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.080
and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.320
Now, I don't actually agree with that on the Russia point, anyway.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.120
I personally feel that if the Japanese leadership,

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:40.000
with regards to getting help from the Soviet Union,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.640
thought there was any hope remaining whatsoever,

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.800
they probably never would have surrendered,

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.480
even if it meant their entire country was burned to the ground.

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.760
The Soviet Union declaring war on Japan was crucial,

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:55.840
in that it forced them to confront their hopeless diplomatic situation.

01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.440
To return to our list of things Japan needed in order to end the war,

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:04.480
third is an assurance that the Imperial Institution would not be abolished.

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.360
This was the main problem the Japanese leadership had

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.360
with the Allied demand for unconditional surrender, of course.

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:16.640
And I'd argue that the question of the Emperor was the most important point on this list.

01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:18.640
And that's both on a national level,

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.560
the Emperor being a very important figure in Japanese society,

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.720
but also on a personal level,

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:28.720
because it's the Emperor himself intervening to end the war.

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:34.240
So an assurance that the Emperor himself would not be executed as a result of doing that

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:37.040
would probably help to speed things along there.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.480
People who defend the atomic bombings as being necessary

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:44.320
often point to the bluster of the Japanese militarists who were,

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.600
even after the bombings and the Russian declaration of war,

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.760
still promising to fight to the last,

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:54.000
with the desperate idea of somehow securing better terms for themselves.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.760
But they didn't do that once the Emperor intervened.

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.080
And the Emperor intervened not to avoid more cities being destroyed.

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.360
Remember, dozens of cities had already been destroyed.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:09.440
The Emperor intervened to protect the Imperial office.

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:11.200
In a post-war interview,

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.240
he explained one of his reasons for choosing to intervene as being that, quote,

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.720
"...if the enemy landed near Ise Bay,

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:22.960
both Ise and Atsuta shrines would immediately come under their control.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:27.840
There would be no time to transfer the sacred regalia of the Imperial family,

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.000
and no hope of protecting them."

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.960
Now, you'd think that protecting the Imperial knick-knacks

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:37.840
would be an unmentionably minor concern when compared to the nuclear bombing raids,

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.120
but apparently not.

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.960
The Emperor took all this Emperor business very seriously,

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.600
as did the rest of the Japanese government.

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:50.000
The militarists on the Supreme Council might have wanted to hold out for better terms,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.480
even if it meant fighting to the death,

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.800
but they were not prepared to contradict the will of the Emperor.

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:01.520
Admiral Leahy wrote in his memoirs that himself and Secretary Stimson,

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:04.080
in their combined staff meetings, were, quote,

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.840
"...certain that the Mikado..."

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.160
That's an antiquated term for the Emperor.

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:11.680
"...could stop the war with a royal word."

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.920
And this turned out to be accurate.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:17.360
That is how the war was stopped on the Japanese end.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:23.040
Now, I don't want to get too deep into speculation about alternate history timelines today,

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:27.200
but I think it's fairly obvious that President Truman and James Burns,

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:31.920
deleting the offer to retain the Imperial institution from the Potsdam Declaration,

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:34.400
almost certainly lengthened the war.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:38.400
If the Emperor didn't intervene to bring about a surrender immediately

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.280
upon receiving peace terms that assured his position,

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.280
he almost certainly would have,

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.720
when that was coupled with a Soviet declaration of war.

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.840
Japan had only been holding out for Russian mediation

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.720
in the hopes of securing better peace terms.

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.680
After the Soviet declaration of war, that option was fully off the table.

01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.400
So I'd say it's vastly more likely than not

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.720
that having in hand both a declaration of war from the Soviet Union

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:09.680
and surrender terms from the other Allies that assured the Imperial House would survive,

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:12.160
the Emperor would have ended the war right there,

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:16.240
regardless of whether Japan had been hit with nuclear bombs or not.

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.280
Henry Stimson later noted in his memoirs that,

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.160
"...it is possible, in light of the final surrender,

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:27.440
that a clearer and earlier exposition of American willingness to retain the Emperor

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:30.720
would have produced an earlier ending to the war."

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.760
And he concluded in 1948 that,

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:36.640
"...history might find that the United States,

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:41.360
by its delay in stating its position, had prolonged the war."

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:44.560
Now, it would be very simple to conclude at this point that,

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.480
with regards to the end of the war,

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.120
the question of the Emperor was everything,

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.080
and the nuclear bombs didn't do anything.

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.400
But is that really the case?

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.480
Let's pose a few questions.

01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:57.920
Firstly, we can ask,

01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.360
were the bombs necessary to defeat Japan militarily?

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:04.160
And the answer to that is obviously no.

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:06.320
The Japanese leadership were beaten,

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:09.760
and they knew they were beaten long before the bombs were dropped.

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.640
So, were the bombs necessary to defeat Japan

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:18.080
without needing to carry out a ground invasion of the four main Japanese islands?

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:22.160
Well, to start with, we've quoted multiple US military leaders today

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.480
who say that Japan was ready to surrender

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.080
without either an invasion or the bombs being necessary.

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:31.520
But can we really trust their judgment of the situation?

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:34.640
You see, those leaders had a couple of potential reasons

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.600
to downplay the effectiveness of the bomb.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.360
The first of these is simply that

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.560
they didn't want to be put out of a job by this thing.

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.840
The worry there was that,

01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.560
if the atomic bombs really are that effective,

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:50.880
then maybe we don't need such a large conventional military force anymore.

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:53.040
So, clear your desk.

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.920
And another reason, I imagine, was pride.

01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:58.720
If it's you who's been fighting the war all this time,

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.720
backing Japan into a corner and bringing them to the verge of surrender,

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:05.440
you probably don't want the narrative afterwards to be

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.920
scientists save the day and end the war with their new bomb.

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:13.360
It kind of undercuts all the work you did prior to that.

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.040
So I can see the motive there for US military leaders at the time to say,

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:27.280
However, these ulterior motives do not mean that the military leaders

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:31.840
who spoke out against the bomb were necessarily lying or wrong.

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.920
We know from what we've talked about today

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.120
that the Japanese leadership was close to surrender,

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:40.240
and was, as President Truman wrote in his diary,

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.760
asking for peace.

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:45.360
Japan would have surrendered long before an invasion if,

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:49.760
for instance, they thought they could secure terms which were acceptable to them.

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:53.120
They didn't actually want to be invaded just for the sake of it,

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:58.000
they were holding out for an invasion in the hopes of avoiding an unconditional surrender.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.120
So US military leaders who claimed the bombs were not necessary to end the war were correct,

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:06.400
even if they had an ulterior motive for saying so.

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:08.320
Instead of a motivation to lie,

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:12.720
they could just have easily have had a motivation to tell an uncomfortable truth.

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.400
So then, were the bombs necessary to force Japan

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.800
to offer to surrender on the Allied terms without any conditions?

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.960
And the answer to this is also no, because they didn't do that.

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:27.120
Even after two atomic bombs,

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:31.120
the Japanese leadership still only offered to surrender on the condition

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.840
that they were assured they could keep the Emperor.

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:38.400
And between that offer to surrender and their eventual actual surrender,

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.440
they didn't get hit with any more nuclear bombs.

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:44.720
All this being said, I do not think that the nuclear bombs

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.880
had absolutely no effect at all on Japan's decision to surrender.

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:52.800
It would be going much too far to make that claim, in my opinion.

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.440
I'd say there were two main effects that the bombs had upon the end of the war.

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:02.160
Firstly, the nuclear bomb probably indirectly shortened the war,

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:07.200
because its existence prompted Truman to try to finish the war without the Soviet Union,

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:11.760
which in turn prompted Stalin to speed up his plans to declare war on Japan,

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:16.400
and that declaration of war sped up the Emperor intervening in the Supreme Council

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.640
to bring about an offer to surrender, with their condition, of course.

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.480
The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on the 8th of August,

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:28.640
and it's likely that if they weren't racing to get in the war as quickly as possible,

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.600
they would have declared war later in August sometime,

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.440
the 15th is what Stalin told Truman at Potsdam.

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:38.640
So we can say that, all other things being equal,

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:43.520
the existence of the atomic bomb probably shortened the war by a week or so.

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:48.480
The other effect the nuclear bomb had on the end of the war is a rather interesting one.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:54.160
And let's read a post-war quote from Cabinet Secretary Sakomizu talking about the bomb.

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.560
"...the chance had come to end the war.

01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.400
It was not necessary to blame the military side, the manufacturing people, or anyone else,

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.320
just the atomic bomb.

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.320
It was a good excuse.

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:10.800
Someone said the atomic bomb was the kamikaze to save Japan."

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:16.800
So, the bomb provided the non-military Japanese leadership with an excuse to proclaim defeat

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:21.440
that didn't involve blaming, or shaming, their proud military.

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:24.720
It lessened the risk of a revolt of the armed forces,

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:28.400
and it was a way to end the war while salvaging some pride,

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:35.440
as well as casting those killed by the bombs not as civilian war victims, but as heroic martyrs.

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:40.080
The Emperor's radio announcement declaring the end of the war took a similar approach.

01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:44.880
Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb,

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:48.960
the power of which to do damage is indeed incalculable,

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:51.920
taking the toll of many innocent lives.

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:56.000
Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in an ultimate collapse

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.160
and obliteration of the Japanese nation,

01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:02.720
but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.520
So the bomb allowed the Japanese leadership to say,

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:08.640
hey, we weren't beaten in a fair fight here.

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:12.720
Our brave military was gearing up for a decisive last battle,

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:16.880
but those cowardly Americans, they were too scared to face us.

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:22.800
So they invented this terrible bomb and started dropping it on innocent civilians, those monsters.

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.000
So I suppose we have to be the adults in the room here

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.440
and agree to stand down before you lunatics go and blow up the whole planet in a nuclear war.

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:38.480
So instead of being beaten fairly here, we're sort of like heroes for giving up, right?

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:40.800
Does anyone buy that?

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.840
Now this is desperate spin from a government trying to salvage whatever pride it could.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.240
Anyone who takes this at face value,

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:51.760
particularly the bit about the toll of many innocent lives,

01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:54.240
is falling for imperial propaganda.

01:50:54.240 --> 01:51:00.000
The Emperor and the Japanese leadership did not care about the innocent civilian casualties.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.680
The Supreme Council's plan for their civilians was for them to die in a wave of suicide attacks,

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:08.560
fighting a vastly better equipped allied military.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:14.080
So do not lie to me that they suddenly came over all sympathetic about their poor subjects.

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:18.560
The problem for the Japanese leadership was not that innocent civilians were being killed,

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:23.200
it's that innocent civilians were being killed in a manner that was not useful.

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.560
They didn't want them being blown up in nuclear explosions,

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:30.960
they wanted them rushing American machine guns armed with bamboo sticks.

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.600
If they actually gave a toss about their civilians,

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:38.160
they would have surrendered months before they did when it was obvious the war was lost.

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:44.000
Instead, they selfishly hung on, trying to save their own positions and reputations.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.880
They didn't want to take responsibility for the enormous mistake they had made.

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.120
So the bomb provided to the Japanese government an excuse to end the war

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:56.160
that did not involve blaming anyone in particular.

01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:00.560
It's not anyone's fault all this, it's not like we did anything wrong,

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:05.040
it's just that they've got nuclear bombs now, and there's no accounting for that.

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:08.640
So it's possible in this regard that the bombs also shortened the war

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:14.240
by providing a face-saving excuse for the Japanese leadership to call it quits.

01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:17.120
Now, as for whether this was a decisive factor,

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:21.840
as in if the bombs didn't exist and the Japanese government had no similar excuse

01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:26.160
they wouldn't have surrendered when they did, I honestly can't say.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:30.160
However, I will note that both of these possible effects of the bombs,

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:33.280
those being speeding up the Soviet declaration of war

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:36.880
and providing a face-saving excuse to quit,

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:40.960
do not require the bombs to be dropped in the middle of cities.

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:44.000
And this is a very important point that often goes overlooked

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.200
in the debate about whether the bombs were necessary or not.

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:49.920
Because beyond whether the bombs were necessary,

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:52.560
we also need to ask whether or not it was necessary

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:56.320
to use the bombs in the manner in which they were used.

01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:01.760
There are other ways to use nuclear bombs than to drop them on civilians, of course.

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:05.120
On that note, this person is Leo Szilard.

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:09.200
Szilard was a Hungarian physicist who, in 1933,

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:12.560
conceived the idea of a nuclear chain reaction.

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.920
Szilard once lived in Germany, but he left when Hitler became the chancellor.

01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:21.600
In 1939, Szilard approached Albert Einstein

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:24.800
and asked him to put his name to a letter Szilard had written,

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:28.240
warning then-President Roosevelt about the possibility

01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:31.280
of Nazi development of nuclear weapons.

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:35.280
The Einstein-Zilard letter prompted action by Roosevelt,

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:38.320
leading to the creation of the Manhattan Project,

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.400
which Szilard also worked on.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:44.000
Now, Szilard and many other scientists working on the project

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.840
were motivated by fears of a nuclear Nazi Germany,

01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:50.320
something which, thankfully, never came about.

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:53.520
Once it was clear the Nazis would be defeated, however,

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:59.680
several scientists began warning against the now unnecessary use of the nuclear bomb.

01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:03.840
A document called the Frank Report was put together in 1945

01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:07.520
and signed by several prominent physicists, including Szilard.

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:10.880
The Frank Report warned about the possibility of the bomb's use

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:13.280
triggering an international arms race

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:17.200
and strongly advised against an unannounced attack against Japan.

01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:21.440
The scientists behind the Frank Report instead advised Truman that, quote,

01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:24.560
"...a demonstration of the new weapon may best be made

01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:28.080
before the eyes of representatives of all United Nations

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:30.720
on the desert or a barren island."

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:33.520
Now, allow me to lay my cards on the table here

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:36.880
and say that this is how I think things should have been handled.

01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:40.160
A public announcement and demonstration of the bomb,

01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:42.720
coupled with an explicit warning to Japan,

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:45.840
would have provided the peace faction in the Japanese government

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:50.160
with the exact same excuse to quit without blaming their military.

01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:52.160
The Emperor could still have done his

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.280
we're pulling out of the war to save the world routine,

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.200
except without two cities full of civilians being destroyed.

01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.640
If the nuclear bombs were influential in ending the war,

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:06.160
it was by their existence, not by their use.

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:08.880
In order to use them as an excuse to surrender,

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:12.480
the Japanese leadership just needed to know about them,

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.480
not actually be hit by them.

01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:17.520
One argument against demonstrating the bomb publicly

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:20.240
was that they were worried it might not work.

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.920
Henry Stimson later wrote that,

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:25.520
nothing would have been more damaging to our effort to obtain surrender

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:29.200
than a warning or a demonstration followed by a dud,

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.160
which is a perfectly valid line of reasoning.

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:35.760
Until the Trinity test, when you know they work.

01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:37.920
After that, there's no excuse.

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:40.080
And the infuriating thing about this

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:44.000
is that if this public demonstration and warning didn't work,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.440
you could still then use them against Japan afterwards.

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:50.240
I mean, you shouldn't drop them on cities, regardless,

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.000
but you could do that.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.560
Doing it this way around costs you nothing

01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:58.160
and potentially spurs the lives of two cities full of civilians.

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:02.480
The United States absolutely should have went public with the bomb.

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:05.920
However, with regards to the Frank Report's suggestions,

01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:10.240
Groves and Oppenheimer didn't appreciate this bunch of bleeding hearts

01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:12.800
telling them what to do with their new toy.

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:15.600
Oppenheimer had previously written about the quote,

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.400
fallacy of regarding a controlled test

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:21.040
as the culmination of the work of this laboratory.

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:24.720
The laboratory is operating under a directive to produce weapons.

01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:28.800
This directive has been and will be rigorously adhered to.

01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.880
So they didn't put in all this time and effort

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:34.960
just to blow up an empty field somewhere for some diplomats and journalists.

01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:36.400
They were making a weapon

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:40.000
and they were going to drop it on a city without warning.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.560
The Frank Report was ignored.

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:46.000
Not to be deterred, Leo Szilard put together a petition

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.640
signed by 70 Manhattan Project scientists

01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:51.200
warning Truman about the possibility of quote,

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.760
opening the door to an era of devastation on an unimaginable scale.

01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:58.640
In attempting to get this petition to the president,

01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:02.720
Szilard, on the 28th of May, met with James Burns,

01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:07.840
who, I'm sure you can guess, was not very sympathetic to Szilard's view.

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.360
Szilard later stated,

01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:12.800
Burns was concerned about Russia's post-war behavior.

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:15.680
Russian forces had moved into Hungary and Romania.

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.320
Burns thought it would be very difficult to persuade Russia

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.320
to withdraw its troops from these countries

01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:25.120
and that Russia would be more manageable if impressed by American military might.

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:29.680
I shared Burns' concern about Russia's throwing its weight around in the post-war period,

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:32.480
but I was completely flabbergasted by the assumption

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:36.240
that rattling the bomb might make Russia more manageable.

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:39.440
Szilard's petition never did make it to Truman.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:43.600
Now, this quote from Burns here about making the Russians more manageable,

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.040
along with other documents that came to light in the post-war period,

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:50.320
for instance, the target committee's desire for the bomb to be used

01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:53.280
in a manner that would ensure international recognition,

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.680
and Truman's diary entries revealing that he knew of the emperor's desire for peace

01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:59.360
prior to the bombs being used,

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:03.120
allowed certain people to construct an alternative historical narrative

01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:08.480
to the accepted story of America using the bomb to avoid an invasion of Japan.

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:12.960
In this new telling, America, thinking ahead to the post-war period,

01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:18.400
used the bomb primarily as an indirect diplomatic weapon against the Soviet Union,

01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.560
rather than as a direct military weapon against the Empire of Japan.

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:27.200
Now, there is evidence to support that this motivation was certainly a factor.

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:31.280
It definitely was for Secretary of State James Burns, for instance,

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:36.480
but this evidence has led some to conclude that the bombs were dropped solely to intimidate Russia,

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:39.040
and this is going much too far, in my opinion.

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:44.240
Anyone who points to a singular reason as the explanation for why the bombs were dropped

01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:46.960
is definitely oversimplifying the history.

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:50.400
The bombs were dropped for a combination of many reasons,

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:52.480
and let's list some of them.

01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:57.680
So first, the bombs were dropped, in part, to limit Soviet influence in Asia

01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:03.440
and make other diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Union go smoother for the United States.

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:06.480
Although this turned out to be an enormous miscalculation,

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:10.400
it was assumed, incorrectly, that it would take the Soviets a lot longer

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:13.440
to develop their own nuclear weapons than it actually did,

01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:19.280
and the United States would get to enjoy a long stretch of time as the world's only nuclear power.

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:24.080
Unbeknownst to Truman, however, Stalin had spies inside the Manhattan Project

01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:27.600
who were sending plans and information back to Russia,

01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:32.640
in just a few short years, the Soviet Union would be testing their own nuclear weapons,

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:35.520
and the feared arms race was on.

01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:39.680
Next, the bombs were dropped, in part, to force an end to the war

01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:44.400
without the United States being seen to back down from unconditional surrender.

01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.880
It was more preferable to certain people

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:50.560
that the United States set off nuclear bombs in the middle of cities

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:55.920
than the president take a knock to his popularity by looking hypocritical or weak.

01:59:55.920 --> 02:00:00.640
Another possible reason the bombs were dropped was to justify their expense.

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:03.200
Admiral Leahy argues in his memoirs that,

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:07.360
"...it was my reaction that the scientists and others wanted to make this test

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:11.040
because of the vast sums that had been spent on the project.

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:14.240
Truman knew that and so did other people involved."

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.360
The Manhattan Project was enormously expensive

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:23.120
and diverted many of the United States' top scientists and engineers away from other useful work.

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:27.840
It was very costly in terms of dollars, materials, and manpower,

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:31.840
and the project's management wanted something to show for the expense.

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.720
They didn't want the culmination of their work to simply be blowing up a field somewhere.

02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:39.920
Another motivation, surely, was revenge.

02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:43.920
The White House press release announcing the use of the bomb at Hiroshima stated,

02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:47.360
"...the Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor.

02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:50.240
They have been repaid many fold."

02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:54.960
So this thinking is that the Japanese began the war with a sneak attack.

02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:58.000
They carried out many war crimes and atrocities.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
They mistreated prisoners of war.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.800
And even though they began the war and lost it,

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:05.360
they still arrogantly refused to surrender

02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:10.800
and dared to try and impose their own surrender terms on the Allied forces that had beaten them.

02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:14.640
So yeah, we bombed them, but they were asking for it.

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:18.320
This motivation would be a lot more sympathetic and understandable

02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:21.280
had the bombs not been dropped on civilians.

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.400
Because counter to what the White House press release said,

02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:27.920
the Japanese did not begin the war at Pearl Harbor.

02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:31.280
The Japanese leadership and military did that.

02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:34.160
The Japanese civilians were not consulted.

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:38.480
If the United States wanted to use the bombs to pay back Pearl Harbor,

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:41.360
they should have dropped one on a military target.

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:44.000
Or the Supreme Council, I suppose.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.680
Related to that last point,

02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:51.360
another motivation that influenced the use of the bombs was just basic, regular racism.

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:56.560
It is very worth remembering that the racist ideas that inspired Nazi Germany

02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:01.360
to commit such terrible atrocities were not limited to that country's borders.

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.760
When we've been talking about America today,

02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:08.160
it was an America decades prior to the signing of the Civil Rights Act.

02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:12.320
James Burns, a very influential figure in the events we've been talking about,

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:15.120
was a supporter of racial segregation.

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:20.320
And President Truman himself referred to the Japanese people as beasts several times.

02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:23.440
And once, when defending the use of the bombs specifically,

02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:24.240
he wrote that,

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:31.840
This is also undoubtedly one of the reasons that Japan,

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:36.080
and not Nazi Germany, was targeted with the nuclear bombs.

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.400
It was much easier for the people behind the bomb

02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:40.800
to justify the use of such a destructive weapon

02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:44.080
if it wasn't going to be used to kill white people.

02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:45.760
And now, hold up a second,

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.080
scroll back up, everyone who just scrolled down,

02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:49.680
to type in the comment box that

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.280
of course the bombs were used against Japan and not Nazi Germany.

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:57.200
Nazi Germany surrendered before the bombs were ready to be used.

02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:59.040
Now, I know that, obviously,

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:00.720
but I didn't say used.

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:02.160
I said targeted.

02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:05.200
And Japan was chosen as the target for the nuclear bombs

02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:08.160
two years before Nazi Germany's surrender.

02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:12.560
Japan was chosen as the target way back in 1943.

02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:15.680
And when General Leslie Groves briefed President Truman

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:19.200
about the project in April 1945, he stated,

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.600
Another factor behind the use of the bombs

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:28.640
was simply the momentum of the project.

02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:30.640
At the top of the United States leadership,

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:33.040
there was a vacuum of responsibility.

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:36.480
With Roosevelt's death and the newly installed President Truman

02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:39.840
only just learning about the project near to its completion,

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:43.280
there's a sense that things were simply too far along to be halted,

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.920
without very firm leadership, anyway.

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:49.440
Truman's job was not to get in the bomb's way.

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:52.880
Leslie Groves described Truman's role in the atomic bombings as,

02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:02.320
He was a rubber stamp for the project, basically.

02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:05.840
Truman simply assumed the bomb would be used when ready.

02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.000
He didn't even give a specific order for the first two bombs to be dropped.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.920
And after the first two bombs, it was ordered that no more would be dropped

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:16.640
without his explicit permission to do so.

02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:20.480
Which of course implies that they didn't need that permission beforehand.

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:23.520
We can see something of an abdication of responsibility

02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:25.680
among those behind the nuclear bomb.

02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:27.680
In his memoirs, Truman states,

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:30.800
I had realized, of course, that the atomic bomb explosion

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.160
would inflict damage and casualties beyond imagination.

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:37.600
On the other hand, the scientific advisors of the committee reported,

02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:41.840
We can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war.

02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:45.520
We see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.

02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:49.360
It was their conclusion that no technical demonstration they might propose,

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:53.200
such as over a deserted island, would be likely to bring the war to an end.

02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:56.320
It had to be used against an enemy target.

02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:00.880
On the other hand, several top Manhattan Project scientists, including Oppenheimer,

02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:05.920
made efforts to distance themselves from what they claimed was merely a military decision.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.040
In a report issued on the 16th of June, they stated that,

02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:14.480
We have no claim to special competence in solving the political, social, and military problems

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:17.360
which are presented by the advent of atomic power.

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:19.920
Oppenheimer also later stated that,

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:23.520
We didn't know beans about the military situation in Japan.

02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:26.720
We didn't know whether they could be caused to surrender by other means,

02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:29.440
or whether the invasion was really inevitable.

02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:33.200
So Truman's sharing responsibility with the scientists here, saying,

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:35.920
Well, I knew the bomb was gonna be horrible, obviously,

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:39.680
but the scientists told me a peaceful demonstration would never work,

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:43.040
and that I had to drop it on a city, so, you know.

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:44.400
And the scientists are saying,

02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:47.600
Hey, well, what are you listening to us for? We don't know.

02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:49.680
We're physicists. We just built the thing.

02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:53.040
We don't know about foreign policy or military strategy.

02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:56.480
There's a sense that nobody's really in control of this thing.

02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:00.800
The ball was rolling, and nobody had the inclination to stop it.

02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:03.520
I would like to add, however, that regardless of any of this,

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:07.280
Truman is still responsible here, and he still made a decision,

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:10.720
even if it was more of a passive decision than an active one.

02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.960
Now, all this has led some to wonder about whether or not the bombs would have been used

02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:18.080
had President Roosevelt not died when he did.

02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:22.640
Albert Einstein, who I'm told was a rather smart guy in certain regards,

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:24.720
came to this conclusion, stating that,

02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:29.440
The use of the atomic bombs was precipitated by a desire to end the war in the Pacific

02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:32.400
by any means before Russia's participation.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.200
I'm sure if President Roosevelt had still been there,

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:37.120
none of that would have been possible.

02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:41.840
So as we've seen, the bombs were dropped for a combination of many reasons,

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:45.520
but none of these was to avoid an invasion of Japan.

02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:49.120
By the time it was an option to drop nuclear bombs on Japan,

02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:51.680
an invasion was already off the table.

02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:53.840
It was no longer necessary.

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:57.680
Both Truman and Burns thought that Japan was going to surrender

02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:00.640
because of the upcoming Russian declaration of war,

02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:05.760
and the bombs were dropped, in part, to attempt to force a surrender prior to that.

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.160
Before we wrap up today, we should ask,

02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:11.200
Where did this invasion narrative come from?

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:14.960
Why is it the enduring popular perception of events?

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:17.200
Let's return to the start of the video,

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:21.600
and talk again about what I called the trolley problem version of events.

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:24.400
Now, I have a confession to make about this.

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:29.600
What I do when I want to find an example of a poor argument put forward ineptly,

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:33.760
is go and check if Prager University has ever made a video on the topic.

02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:37.040
And would you know it, they have made one about the nuclear bombs,

02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:40.720
titled, Was it wrong to drop the atom bomb on Japan?

02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:44.480
Which, of course, concludes it was completely justified.

02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:47.520
And the version of events written at the start of my video

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.760
is constructed almost entirely out of statements made in their video.

02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:56.240
So, that's right, this was a stealth PragerU response video this whole time.

02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:57.280
What a twist.

02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:01.040
So this PragerU video starts out by giving far too much agency

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:04.640
to a certain Mr. President Truman, when they say,

02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:07.840
Truman sought to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:12.560
two major military industrial targets, to avoid an invasion of Japan.

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:16.960
So they're assigning to Truman the decision of which targets to bomb there.

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:21.680
Now, Truman had no input on deciding to target Hiroshima or Nagasaki,

02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:26.720
he didn't even know Nagasaki was going to be bombed until after it already had been.

02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:32.080
Nagasaki wasn't even the target city of the plane that dropped the bomb on Nagasaki,

02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:36.320
it only got attacked because the primary targets was too cloudy to hit.

02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:39.040
Now, I could pick through this video line by line,

02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:41.520
giving rebuttals like this to each of its claims,

02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:43.600
but this video is long enough already,

02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:46.160
so instead I just want to focus on two quotes

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.440
that concern the bombs versus invasion narrative.

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.880
And the first is this,

02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:55.040
it was only the dropping of the atom bombs that allowed the emperor

02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:58.640
and the so-called peace faction in the Japanese government

02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:01.440
to negotiate an end to the war.

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:04.880
Now, this is just a total inversion of reality.

02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:09.200
The atom bombs did not allow the emperor to negotiate an end to the war,

02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:12.480
either with the United States or within his own government.

02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:15.360
The problem was not that, prior to the bombs,

02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:19.360
Japan was refusing to negotiate an end to the war,

02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:23.840
it's that they were insisting on negotiating an end to the war.

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.160
The United States was the country refusing to negotiate an end to the war

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:31.200
because they were insisting on unconditional surrender.

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:35.680
And the emperor didn't negotiate an end to the war within his own government,

02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:37.120
he was the emperor.

02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:39.120
The government did what he said.

02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:44.240
The militarists wanted to fight to the death even after the nuclear bombs were dropped.

02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:47.760
There was no negotiation, there was no convincing them,

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:51.520
it was a deadlock broken by the emperor's divine ruling.

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:55.680
This idea that the Japanese leadership were committed to total war

02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:01.520
only until the bombs forced them to the negotiating table is entirely false.

02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:04.720
I also have a particular distaste for the phrasing

02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:07.760
it was only the dropping of the atom bomb

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:11.520
because Imperial Japan was beaten long before the nuclear bombs were dropped

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:16.240
and pretending that it took the nuclear bombs to defeat Japan is not only untrue,

02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:18.400
it's a dangerous exaggeration.

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:21.680
It makes the Empire of Japan into such a powerful enemy

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:24.400
that you need nuclear force to take them down

02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:26.000
and it covers up the reality,

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.600
which is that Imperial Japan was already a defeated state

02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:32.400
run by incompetent, ignorant leaders.

02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:35.280
The next quote I want to talk about is this.

02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:39.120
All the viable alternate scenarios to secure American victory,

02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:43.120
all would have meant significantly greater American and Allied casualties

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:47.040
and much higher Japanese civilian and military casualties.

02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:49.840
According to American military estimates at the time,

02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:53.040
those numbers would have been well above one million.

02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:55.840
Now, you may have noticed today that we have not thus far

02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:58.480
discussed what the projected wartime casualties

02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:01.600
of a full Allied invasion of Japan were going to be.

02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:06.080
And that's because until after the war, there were no such projections made.

02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:08.960
This quote from PragerU here is a lie.

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:12.800
The enormously high death estimates for a full invasion of Japan

02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:16.160
were entirely a post-war fabrication.

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:19.280
Now, before we talk about where this one million figure came from,

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:22.800
I'd like to remind everyone that an invasion was unnecessary

02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:25.200
and not going to happen anyway.

02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:27.280
Whatever death estimates you come up with,

02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:30.160
a thousand, a million, a hundred million,

02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:31.520
it does not matter.

02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:34.080
An invasion was not going to happen

02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:36.880
and the bombs were not used to avert it.

02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:38.720
Right, so with that in mind,

02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:42.000
this one million figure comes from an article published

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.880
in Henry Stimson's name in Harper's Magazine in 1947.

02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:49.840
This article was written in response to various criticisms

02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:51.440
of the use of the atomic bomb,

02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:54.240
which had begun emerging after the end of the war,

02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:57.920
and it was edited by various people responsible for the bomb,

02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:00.240
including General Leslie Groves.

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:03.600
The article lays out the trolley problem excuse.

02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.640
We simply had to do the nuclear bombs, it argues.

02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:08.560
There was no other way.

02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:11.280
Talking about the apparently inevitable invasion,

02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:12.320
the article states,

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:15.520
"...I was informed that such operations might be expected

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:19.840
to cost over a million casualties to American forces alone."

02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:21.520
Now, as I've already stated,

02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:24.400
there is no evidence of such an estimate being made

02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:26.080
prior to the end of the war,

02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:29.760
and President Truman at no point presented the nuclear bombs

02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:32.560
as an alternative to an Allied invasion of Japan

02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:36.400
until he had to justify the use of the bombs after the war.

02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.440
Only then did the invasion become inevitable,

02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:42.880
and did the death estimates shoot up into the millions.

02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:47.040
This is where the atom bombs versus invasion narrative comes from.

02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:48.480
After the bomb was dropped,

02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:52.160
the US leadership started telling lies about it.

02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:57.440
President Truman himself got started very early on August 9th, 1945,

02:12:57.440 --> 02:12:59.440
when he addressed the nation with a speech

02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:02.560
seeking to justify the use of the nuclear bomb,

02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:03.680
and I quote,

02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:07.840
"...the world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima,

02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:09.520
a military base.

02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:12.480
That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid,

02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.600
insofar as possible, the killing of civilians."

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:18.240
Now, this is a lie, obviously.

02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:19.840
Hiroshima was a city.

02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:22.800
The bomb's target committee describes it as a city.

02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:26.400
Remember that Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size

02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:29.840
that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed.

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:32.720
And Truman's lying continues as follows,

02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:35.760
"...but that attack is only a warning of things to come.

02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.440
If Japan does not surrender,

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:40.720
bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries,

02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:44.560
and unfortunately, thousands of civilian lives will be lost.

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:49.120
I urge Japanese civilians to leave industrial cities immediately,

02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:51.600
and save themselves from destruction."

02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:55.680
So Truman isn't justifying the bombing of Hiroshima by saying

02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:58.480
it was a city with several war industries in it,

02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:01.360
which is what the eventual excuse came to be.

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:05.520
He's going for broke here and saying it was solely a military base,

02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:07.200
and that unless Japan surrenders,

02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:10.480
bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries,

02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:13.040
implying that that has not happened already.

02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:18.080
Averting an invasion was not given as a reason for using the bombs in this speech,

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:20.720
because they hadn't come up with that excuse yet.

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:26.720
Truman also here claims the bomb was used to spare the lives of thousands and thousands,

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:29.840
not the later claimed millions and millions.

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:32.320
Another lie that became popular after the war

02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:38.080
was that the nuclear bomb was dropped in response to Japan ignoring the Potsdam Declaration.

02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:41.120
However, the only existing direct order to go ahead

02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:43.440
with the use of the nuclear bombs against Japan

02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:46.400
was issued prior to the Potsdam Declaration.

02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:49.600
Not by Truman, of course, he didn't have anything to do with it.

02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:53.520
It was drafted by Leslie Groves, approved by Henry Stimson,

02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:55.600
and delivered to General Karl Spatz,

02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:59.840
commander of the Strategic Air Forces, on July the 25th,

02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:03.040
the day before the Potsdam Declaration was issued.

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:05.120
They did not wait for a response

02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:08.240
before issuing the order to proceed with the atomic bombings.

02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:12.880
The order was issued before Japan had even seen the surrender terms.

02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:15.520
As a result of these lies and others,

02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:19.440
the simplified version of the history came into existence.

02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:22.240
And it isn't hard to understand why this caught on.

02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:28.000
Firstly, it took me two minutes at the top of the video to explain the easy lie,

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.160
and the whole rest of the video to explain the much more complicated truth.

02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:38.320
The bombs versus invasion narrative is simple, it's plausible, and it's easy to understand.

02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:43.760
It isn't true, of course, but why let that get in the way of a good story?

02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:47.360
But the invasion narrative is not just easier to understand,

02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:49.360
it's also easier to accept.

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:54.800
Because if we question it, we have to contend with the possibility, or the certainty,

02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:56.960
that the United States of America

02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:02.160
incinerated two cities full of innocent civilians for no good reason.

02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:04.080
Given the enormous death toll,

02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:08.960
the truth, that the use of the bombs was pointless and accomplished nothing,

02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:11.280
is very difficult to accept.

02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.480
Now, it's about time for me to conclude this video here.

02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:17.520
And trying to neatly sum up such a complicated event

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:21.120
with so many actors all with their own contradictory motivations

02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:23.600
is surely an exercise in frustration.

02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:25.600
There is no doing it justice.

02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.600
That said, the nuclear bombs used against Japan

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:32.640
were an expensive gamble that did not pay off.

02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:35.600
They were dropped on civilians, intentionally,

02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:38.320
per the flawed strategy of morale bombing,

02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:41.040
to force Japan to surrender unconditionally

02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:43.520
before the Soviet Union joined the war.

02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:46.800
In this, they were a complete failure.

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:50.560
The lie that the bombs were used only to avert an invasion of Japan

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:52.640
was a post-war construction,

02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:56.560
intended to provide justification for a completely avoidable

02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:00.320
and indefensible slaughter of innocent civilians.

02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:03.200
The civilians who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki

02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:06.800
were not killed to avert an invasion of Japan,

02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:11.600
nor did they bravely give their lives in sacrifice to save their empire.

02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:14.480
Their deaths were entirely unnecessary,

02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:16.800
and we owe it to them to admit that.

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:19.840
Often, when terrible injustices

02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:22.720
towards the inhabitants of one country are discussed,

02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:24.080
the response will come,

02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:26.560
well, what about all the terrible injustices

02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.200
carried out by that country to other people?

02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:32.480
This is a question that has varying motivations behind it

02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:34.640
of varying legitimacy.

02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:37.920
On the one hand, certain events from the Second World War,

02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:40.400
and wider history in general, I suppose,

02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:43.040
do get much more attention and discussion,

02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:44.320
for whatever reasons,

02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:46.960
than other events of equal importance.

02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:50.000
And it is perfectly valid to ask that we do not forget

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.280
that Imperial Japan committed many terrible war crimes

02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:55.840
and was, both during and before the war,

02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:59.840
a brutal totalitarian oppressor of many different people.

02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:02.080
I think it's very important to make clear here

02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:03.840
that nothing we've talked about today

02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:06.160
should generate any sympathy whatsoever

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:08.800
for Imperial Japan as a concept

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:12.880
or the leadership of the Imperial Japanese government or military.

02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:15.840
The crimes of the Empire of Japan were dreadful,

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:19.360
and there is no punishment that perpetrators would not deserve.

02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:21.840
And many of these crimes, it is worth pointing out,

02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:24.480
have went either ignored or unapologized for

02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:27.120
by the Japanese government to this day.

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:28.560
All that being said,

02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:32.400
we must be careful to accurately allocate fault here.

02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:34.960
Because unfortunately, that same question,

02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:37.120
what about all the stuff they did,

02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:40.160
is not always asked with such innocent intentions.

02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:43.600
Sometimes this question reveals something very worrisome,

02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:46.000
and that's the belief in racial crimes

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.840
that can be avenged with violence

02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:50.080
towards other members of that group.

02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:53.840
And this is the worst sort of us versus them thinking.

02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:57.120
They did something bad to us, so they,

02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:00.640
and by they I mean anyone I reckon is in that group,

02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:03.360
deserves something bad in return.

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:06.160
So while we should have no sympathy whatsoever

02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:08.000
for the Empire of Japan,

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.960
the schoolchildren of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:13.520
were not the Empire of Japan.

02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:15.520
They were some schoolchildren.

02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:18.080
They had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor.

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.800
They did not consent to go to war.

02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:23.840
They were needlessly put in danger by one power,

02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.920
and needlessly killed by another.

02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:28.880
Nothing was avenged or paid back.

02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:30.320
There was no point to it,

02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.320
but to provide yet more evidence

02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:35.520
that there's no monopoly held by any nation or race

02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:38.480
on a disregard for the lives of the powerless.

02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:41.760
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
