0	1440	Hello, everyone.
1440	7680	Today, we're going to be talking about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War.
7680	10680	And let's start today by telling a story.
10680	17560	So, at the conclusion to the Second World War, Japan, though their military forces had been soundly defeated,
17560	21440	stubbornly refused to negotiate an end to the conflict.
21440	26920	Their militaristic leaders had committed to total war in defense of the Japanese Empire,
26960	32880	and were prepared to mobilize Japanese civilians to combat any potential American invasion.
32880	37760	President Harry Truman and his advisors were therefore faced with a difficult choice.
37760	41360	Either they could commit to a long and costly invasion of Japan,
41360	44440	which they estimated would kill more than a million people,
44440	48560	or they could use their secret weapon, the world's first nuclear bombs,
48560	51560	which the United States had recently constructed.
51560	55480	So, in order to shorten the war and avoid the need for an invasion,
55480	62600	Truman decided to drop two bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, two major military and industrial targets.
62600	67440	Demonstrating the extent of the Japanese military's desire to keep fighting, however,
67440	71560	even after these bombs were dropped, Japan's Supreme Council remained deadlocked,
71560	76360	with some military leaders still refusing to consider negotiating a peace.
76360	81880	It took the unprecedented intervention of Emperor Hirohito to break the impasse in the council,
81880	84640	and finally convinced the military to stand down,
84640	86640	bringing an end to the war.
86880	89880	So, that's quite a simple story there.
89880	96560	And presented like this, dropping the nuclear bombs was pretty unambiguously the right and moral thing to do,
96560	99560	when compared to the worse alternative, anyway.
99560	102200	What this is is a basic trolley problem.
102200	104440	You might not like dropping the nuclear bombs,
104440	108360	but if the only other option on the table is a long, costly invasion
108360	111480	that is definitely going to kill and injure even more people,
111480	113480	then the bombs become acceptable.
113480	115480	And justifiable.
115480	121280	And this is a popular and enduring perception of the events that led to the nuclear bombs being dropped,
121280	126720	that they were used specifically to force Japan to surrender, without the need for an invasion.
126720	131320	However, this is Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy,
131320	136480	who was the senior-most United States military officer on active duty during World War II,
136480	141920	and the personal chief of staff to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.
141920	146640	And after the war, with regards to the nuclear bombs, Leahy wrote the following.
146640	150880	It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
150880	154280	was of no material assistance in our war against Japan.
154280	157320	The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender
157320	161280	because of the effect of sea blockade and bombing with conventional weapons.
161280	167400	Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, who was commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet during World War II,
167400	171360	said, at a speech given on October 5th, 1945,
171440	177280	the Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace before the atomic age was announced to the world
177280	181520	with the destruction of Hiroshima, and before the Russian entry into the war.
181520	188320	The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military standpoint, in the defeat of Japan.
188320	194280	And this is General Dwight Eisenhower, who was supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe
194280	197760	during World War II, and later President of the United States.
197760	202160	And his opinion of the atomic bomb was that the Japanese were ready to surrender,
202160	205840	and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing.
205840	212160	And Eisenhower later wrote in his memoirs about a conversation he had with War Secretary Henry Stimson,
212160	213440	in which he states,
227760	238080	It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender.
238080	244000	And in 1944, President Roosevelt directed Henry Stimson to put together a survey team
244000	248800	to write a report on the effectiveness of the Allied aerial bombing tactics during the war.
248800	254960	Published in 1946, this strategic bombing survey came to the conclusion that Japan would have surrendered
254960	259840	even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war,
259840	263440	and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.
264160	266880	So, what's going on here, then?
266880	270480	The people I just quoted there were all involved in the Second World War
270480	274240	in important positions of political and military power.
274240	278560	And instead of viewing the bombs as a necessary lesser-of-two-evils,
278560	284560	they instead see them as everything from simply militarily unnecessary to a grave moral crime.
284960	289600	Now, obviously, if these people are correct that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
289600	291760	were not necessary to end the war,
291760	297680	then the trolley problem version of the story we told at the start of the video can't be true, can it?
297680	300720	So, this is what we're here to investigate today.
300720	304720	Which of these versions of history is closer to the truth?
304720	308240	We're going to take a look at the closing months of the Second World War
308240	310480	in the lead-up to the atomic bombings.
310480	313040	And I think we should start today by briefly introducing
313040	315680	the various people that we're going to be talking about,
315680	317840	a few of whom we've mentioned already.
317840	322240	So, first off, in the United States, we have President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
322240	325360	who was in office for most of the Second World War.
325360	328720	Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945,
328720	332560	meaning that his vice president, Harry Truman, became president,
332560	335360	and he was in office for the remainder of the war,
335360	338320	including the period when the nuclear bombs were dropped.
338320	342320	Working for Truman, we have Chief of Staff Admiral William D. Leahy,
342320	346320	who was one of the people we just quoted who thought the bombs were unnecessary,
346320	348720	Secretary of War Henry L. Stimpson,
348720	352880	who was the person to whom Eisenhower voiced his misgivings about the bomb,
352880	356080	and Secretary of State James F. Burns.
356080	360640	And, spoiler warning, this man in particular makes a lot of very poor decisions.
360640	364080	Leahy and Stimpson both served in the same roles under Roosevelt,
364080	370400	but James F. Burns was appointed Secretary of State by Harry Truman on July 3, 1945.
370400	374080	The nuclear bombs themselves were constructed by the Manhattan Project,
374080	376720	which was directed by General Leslie Groves,
376720	381680	and the actual laboratory that designed the bombs was headed by J. Robert Oppenheimer.
381680	386640	Over in Japan, at the top of the Japanese government, we have Emperor Hirohito,
386640	390960	and he was advised by the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War.
390960	394800	The Supreme Council had six members, and they, for the most part,
394800	398640	fell into two factions, the Moderates and the Hardliners.
398640	402240	So for the Moderates, we have Prime Minister Kantaro Suzuki,
402240	404960	Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo,
404960	407840	and Minister of the Navy Mitsumasa Yonai.
407840	412080	And for the Hardliners, we have Minister of War Kurechika Anami,
412080	415360	Chief of the Army General Staff Yoshijir≈ç Umezu,
415360	418400	and Chief of the Navy General Staff Soemu Toyoda.
418400	421440	We'll get more into the differences between these groups in a little while,
421440	426240	but generally the Hardliners favored a more hardline military strategy,
426240	428320	and the Moderates were more... moderate.
428880	432000	Also important for us here is Naotake Sato,
432000	434560	the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union,
434560	438960	who was in frequent contact with Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo.
438960	442640	And the messages sent between Togo and Sato are key to understanding
442640	445600	the thinking of the Japanese leadership at the time.
445600	450080	Outside of the US and Japan, we have British Prime Minister Winston Churchill
450080	453280	and Premier of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin.
453280	455520	I don't know if you've ever heard of them.
456160	458320	Now, of course, there were many more people than this
458320	460480	involved in the end of the Second World War,
460480	462960	and I'll be mentioning more people going forward.
462960	466080	This list comprises only the most principal actors
466080	469040	in the particular events that we're going to be talking about today.
469040	473120	As well as people, there's going to be a lot of dates and events to remember here,
473120	475520	so I'm going to be using a calendar going forward
475520	477520	so that we can keep track of everything.
477520	480640	The two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
480640	483520	on the 6th and 9th of August, respectively.
483520	487680	And we've also already mentioned the inauguration of Harry Truman on the 12th of April
487680	492720	and his appointing of James Burns to Secretary of State on the 3rd of July.
492720	495040	As we go through the events leading up to the bombings,
495040	499600	I'll add more to this calendar and highlight which days I'm talking about in particular,
499600	502160	and hopefully this will help us to keep organized.
502160	506000	Before all that, though, there is one important event we need to know about
506000	507840	prior to the Second World War,
507840	512720	and that's the Russo-Japanese War fought between 1904 and 1905.
513280	515040	Now, I won't dwell on this too long,
515040	518480	but the very quick Wikipedia summary goes like this.
518480	522400	The Russo-Japanese War was fought between the Russian and Japanese empires
522400	526240	over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea.
526240	530960	So it's two empires fighting over land and influence in Asia, basically.
530960	536320	Anyway, in this war, Russia suffered a series of humiliating and surprising defeats
536320	540800	at the hands of Japan, a nation that Russia was expecting to beat relatively easily.
541280	544480	Perhaps most notable of these defeats is the Battle of Tsushima,
544480	548320	where virtually a whole Russian fleet was sunk by the Japanese navy
548320	550960	who suffered only minor losses themselves.
550960	553200	Russia was forced to sue for peace,
553200	557520	which was mediated in the United States by President Theodore Roosevelt,
557520	561520	and the resulting treaty saw Russia withdrawing their troops from Manchuria,
561520	566160	recognizing Japan's claim to Korea, as well as ceding a bunch of territory.
566160	570160	All this coupled with the fact that the Japanese Empire had initiated the war
570160	573920	with a surprise attack on the Russian-occupied Port Arthur
573920	578800	meant that the Russians were, to put it lightly, rather ticked off about the whole affair.
578800	581280	The disastrous Russian performance in the war
581280	586480	is considered one of the main instigating factors behind the 1905 Russian Revolution,
586480	588880	but that's a story for another day.
588880	591680	So to summarize and generalize a bit,
591680	594880	Russia held a grudge against Japan for beating them in a war
594880	598480	and denying them influence and territory in Asia.
598480	601920	This is all important in the context of the Yalta Conference,
601920	605760	which took place between the 4th and 11th of February there.
605760	609600	This was a meeting of Stalin, Churchill, and Franklin D. Roosevelt
609600	614320	to discuss, among other things, the post-war reorganization of Europe.
614320	618800	Nazi Germany was on its last legs at this point, its defeat was inevitable.
618800	621680	Adolf Hitler shot himself on the 30th of April,
621680	625520	and the German high command surrendered unconditionally on May the 7th.
625520	628560	And the Yalta Conference was held to discuss and negotiate
628560	633040	the various things that should happen following that upcoming Nazi defeat.
633040	635520	The main focus of the conference was Europe,
635520	640880	but important for us here is that the Soviet Union's entry into the war against Japan was discussed.
640880	645280	Churchill and Roosevelt wanted Stalin to declare war on Japan.
645280	649440	Specifically, they wanted him to invade Japanese-occupied Manchuria,
649440	653840	which would make Japan have to fight on an extra front and spread their resources thinner,
653840	656400	and this would hopefully hasten their defeat.
656400	662400	Now, this was a little bit awkward as Russia and Japan had signed a non-aggression pact in 1941,
662400	666000	and that wasn't due to expire until 1946.
666000	671520	Despite this non-aggression pact, Stalin also wanted Russia to declare war against Japan.
671520	674160	However, he wanted something in return.
674160	678080	So on the 11th of February, the Allies signed a secret protocol
678080	680560	agreeing that Russia would enter the war against Japan,
680960	686320	two or three months after Germany has surrendered and the war in Europe is terminated.
686320	690240	And the price for Russia's doing so was that the former rights of Russia
690240	695840	violated by the treacherous attack of Japan in 1904 shall be restored.
695840	697360	And then they're all listed there.
697360	702720	So basically, Stalin was asked to declare war on Japan after the war in Europe was finished,
702720	708400	and he said, okay, but we want back all the stuff that Japan pinched off us back in 1904.
708400	711920	Churchill and Roosevelt agreed, and so the deal was made.
711920	717520	And this deal was kept secret for a few reasons, mainly because Russia is very big.
717520	720400	It was going to take quite a bit of time for the Soviet Union
720400	723840	to transfer military forces from the west to the east,
723840	727760	and they didn't want to risk tipping Japan off to the impending invasion of Manchuria
727760	729600	before it was ready to go ahead.
729600	733200	President Roosevelt, for his part, thought this was a fair deal.
733200	735360	He later stated that the Russians, quote,
735360	738800	"...only want to get back that which has been taken from them."
738800	743440	However, James Burns, then acting as advisor to Roosevelt at Yalta,
743440	747280	worried that the more the United States asked of the Soviet Union,
747280	749520	the more they would demand in return.
749520	751680	Writing in his memoirs after the war,
751680	756400	Burns makes it clear that he thinks too much was conceded to the Russians at Yalta,
756400	759680	although he is careful to give reasons as to why he thinks
759680	763040	the late President Roosevelt made the decisions he did.
763040	768400	Burns does point out, however, that at the time the terms of the secret protocol were decided upon,
768400	771600	he didn't know about them and thus had no influence over them
771600	774400	because he was not Secretary of State.
774400	779200	Mr. Stettinius was Secretary, referring to Edward Stettinius Jr.,
779200	782480	who was Roosevelt's Secretary of State at Yalta.
782480	785840	This is important for us here because although Truman kept on
785840	788320	other of Roosevelt's staff after his death,
788320	790480	he chose to replace Stettinius,
790560	794800	feeling that too many concessions had been made to the Soviet Union at Yalta.
794800	798720	And his new pick for Secretary of State was James Burns,
798720	803600	a choice which signals a change towards a more aggressive stance with regards to Russia.
803600	808560	Which leaves the United States in a bit of an awkward situation, diplomatically speaking.
808560	811280	Under the previous President and Secretary of State,
811280	814240	they'd signed a secret agreement with the Soviet Union,
814240	818320	assuring them various concessions in exchange for going to war against Japan.
818400	822480	But then that President died and his Secretary of State was replaced.
822480	825200	And the incoming President and Secretary of State
825200	828960	aren't at all as keen on conceding anything to the Russians.
828960	832880	And I wonder if that's going to cause any problems down the line.
832880	836320	So let's leave the Allies in their awkward situation there
836320	840160	and discuss what the Japanese government was up to during this time.
840160	844080	And to oversimplify a little, throughout this whole period,
844080	848160	the Japanese leadership had basically a single main aim.
848160	852000	And that was to avoid having to accept an unconditional surrender
852000	855120	and instead achieve a negotiated peace.
855120	858400	The Supreme Council in Japan knew that they couldn't win the war,
858400	862080	but they wanted peace on terms that they could negotiate.
862080	867440	Nazi Germany, of course, was forced to accept an unconditional surrender by the Allies.
867440	873280	Unconditional surrender here meaning surrender without any guarantees being made to the losing side.
873360	877120	And Japan was very keen to avoid a similar fate.
877120	881760	The main sticking point was the question of Japan's imperial institution
881760	884560	and the fate of the Emperor in particular.
884560	888880	The Emperor was more than just a regular old leader in Japanese society.
888880	894080	He was a revered, quasi-divine figure of particularly special importance.
894080	897280	And with his position as the head of the Japanese government,
897280	900080	and importantly, the Japanese military,
900080	905360	Japan accepting unconditional surrender meant that the Emperor could then conceivably be arrested
905360	909280	and tried for war crimes and possibly even executed.
909280	914160	This was something that Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, when advising General MacArthur,
914160	918640	described as comparable to the crucifixion of Christ to us.
918640	922720	The United States was very aware of the special position of the Emperor
922720	925840	and the gravity of the question of what should be done with him,
925840	927840	but we'll get to that a little later.
927840	930720	Now, there were disagreements in Japan's Supreme Council
930720	934720	about what exact peace terms they should attempt to negotiate.
934720	938160	On the more pessimistic, or realistic, end of the scale,
938160	941760	we have Japan just getting out of the war however they can
941760	944400	with the preservation of the imperial institution.
944400	947360	So basically accepting whatever peace terms are offered
947360	950480	so long as they guarantee the Emperor's position.
950480	954320	And on the more optimistic, or unrealistic, end of the scale,
954320	959600	we have Japan getting out of the war while securing the preservation of the imperial institution,
959600	962720	securing the preservation of Japan's military forces,
962720	965120	avoiding a foreign occupation,
965120	968400	maintaining Japan's occupied overseas territories,
968400	973840	and ensuring any trials for Japanese war crimes were carried out by Japan.
973840	978000	Now this was all never going to happen, obviously, but it was argued for.
978000	983520	The hardline militarists on the council were very keen on the preservation of the military,
983520	984560	believe it or not.
984560	988320	Holding out for these terms was obviously a desperate long shot,
988320	990640	but these were equally desperate men.
990640	992800	Regardless of these disagreements though,
992800	996160	the Supreme Council was unified on the first point.
996160	999280	They were absolutely not going to lose the Emperor,
999280	1003520	and therefore they want to avoid an unconditional surrender at any cost.
1003520	1007520	And they pursued this goal both militarily and diplomatically.
1007520	1010160	And let's talk about military strategy first.
1010240	1012480	So the militarists on the Supreme Council
1012480	1016000	favored a strategy of making the war so difficult for the Allies
1016000	1018960	that they would lose their taste for unconditional surrender
1018960	1021120	and decide to negotiate peace,
1021120	1025440	rather than fight on for another year or so at huge cost to themselves.
1025440	1028000	So Japan wasn't going to win the war.
1028000	1029040	They knew that.
1029040	1033440	But they were going to end it on terms that were more acceptable to them.
1033440	1037200	The council anticipated an upcoming Allied invasion of Japan
1037200	1040000	and planned to throw everything they had at it,
1040080	1041600	including civilians,
1041600	1046080	in order to wear down the Allied will to fight and thus secure better terms.
1046080	1050560	A similar situation played out in miniature on the island of Okinawa.
1050560	1054080	Now, Okinawa was occupied by the Japanese military,
1054080	1056240	and when the US military invaded it,
1056240	1059280	local inhabitants of the island, including children,
1059280	1063840	were conscripted by the Japanese military and sent to die by the thousands.
1063840	1067760	And by the time Okinawa was captured by the Allies on July the 2nd,
1067760	1073840	both the Japanese and US militaries had lost considerable amounts of lives and military equipment.
1073840	1078160	It was both a very costly loss and a very costly victory.
1078160	1082720	President Truman, for his part, was very concerned about the losses at Okinawa
1082720	1086640	and feared that committing to a full invasion of Japan could mean, quote,
1086640	1090000	"...an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other."
1090000	1093440	So that's the Supreme Council's military strategy there.
1093440	1097360	Diplomatically, the council's plan was to convince the Soviet Union
1097360	1100640	to mediate a peace between Japan and the other Allies,
1100640	1105280	much like the United States that mediated peace at the end of the Russo-Japanese War.
1105280	1109600	Japan was counting on the pact of neutrality they had with the Soviet Union
1109600	1111920	to keep the Russians out of the war.
1111920	1115840	They hoped that they would have a better chance at securing favorable peace terms
1115840	1118080	if they had the Soviet Union backing them up,
1118080	1120480	and in exchange for helping them with negotiations,
1120480	1123280	the Japanese leadership was prepared to offer Stalin
1123280	1126480	various territorial concessions from their empire.
1126480	1128800	Now, unfortunately for the Japanese people,
1128800	1133360	both the military and diplomatic strategies of the Japanese leadership were,
1133360	1135520	to put it bluntly, rubbish.
1135520	1137840	To take the diplomatic strategy first,
1137840	1140400	in trying to persuade Stalin to help them out,
1140400	1143120	they were bargaining from a position of weakness.
1143120	1145680	They had nothing to offer the Soviet Union
1145680	1149120	that it was not in a position to just take for itself.
1149120	1151120	Stalin didn't want the war to end
1151120	1154560	before he'd had the chance to invade and recapture the territory
1154560	1158000	that had already been promised to him at the Yalta Conference.
1158000	1161360	So why bargain with Japan in exchange for helping them
1161360	1164400	when you could just invade them and take whatever you like?
1164400	1167680	Stalin wanted to be in at the kill, as he put it,
1167680	1171200	and he wasn't about to grant Japan a stay of execution.
1171200	1174080	To accomplish this impossible diplomatic task,
1174080	1176800	Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo
1176800	1180240	sent frequent messages to Japan's ambassador in Moscow,
1180240	1181520	Naotake Sato,
1181600	1186000	instructing him to somehow convince the Russians to help Japan broker peace.
1186000	1190800	Now, Sato was rather a lot more realistic than his colleagues back in Tokyo.
1190800	1192160	He knew the Russians,
1192160	1196560	he realized that the Council's plan was almost certainly not going to work,
1196560	1198640	and he didn't mind telling them.
1198640	1201360	In a series of increasingly frank messages
1201360	1203520	sent in response to Togo's instructions,
1203520	1206960	Sato attempted to make his superiors see sense.
1206960	1209520	And let's quote a few of his cables here.
1209520	1213520	It seems extremely unlikely that Russia would flout the Anglo-Americans
1213520	1215600	and the opinion of the entire world
1215600	1220240	by supporting Japan's war efforts with either moral or material means.
1220240	1223360	I believe in the long run Japan has indeed no choice
1223360	1228080	but to accept unconditional surrender or terms closely equivalent.
1228080	1231920	I believe that Stalin feels there is absolutely no necessity
1231920	1234880	for making a voluntary agreement with Japan.
1234880	1238880	On this point, I see a serious discrepancy between your view
1238880	1241280	and the actual state of affairs,
1241280	1243760	which is a wonderfully insulting line there.
1244320	1248800	Togo, however, didn't appreciate his subordinate's candor.
1248800	1251840	He responded to one of Sato's complaints, quote,
1251840	1256480	"...in spite of your views, you must carry out your instructions.
1256480	1259440	Endeavor to obtain the good officers of the Soviet Union
1259440	1263200	in ending the war short of unconditional surrender."
1263200	1267840	And this is the general pattern of communication that went on between the two.
1267840	1270400	Togo asked Sato to do the impossible.
1270400	1273200	Sato attempted to explain that it was impossible.
1273200	1278880	Togo told him to shut up, shut your face, just do it anyway, please.
1278880	1279600	Thank you.
1279600	1284240	And it's worth noting here that the Allies had cracked the Japanese communication codes
1284240	1286560	and were freely reading Japan's messages,
1286560	1289040	so they were privy to all of this information,
1289040	1293520	as well as Togo and Sato's back-and-forth comedy routine they were working on.
1293520	1296400	Now, militarily, the strategy of the Supreme Council
1296400	1299520	was just as ill-fated as their diplomatic efforts.
1299520	1304560	Expecting the opposing side to lose their nerve and call it quits faster than you
1304560	1309760	when it's your territory being invaded and occupied is quite a risky strategy.
1309760	1315840	It's also a strategy that hinges on the enemy first doing something that you expect them to do,
1315840	1318480	that being here to invade Japan at all.
1318480	1322400	An Allied invasion of Japan was not guaranteed to happen.
1322400	1326080	The United States was working on plans to possibly invade Japan
1326080	1327440	should it be necessary,
1327440	1331680	but we should not make the mistake of thinking that because an invasion was being planned for
1331680	1333440	that it was an inevitability.
1333440	1337120	President Truman wrote in his diary on the 17th of June,
1337120	1341200	shall we invade Japan proper or shall we bomb and blockade?
1341200	1343040	And this is before the Trinity test,
1343040	1346480	before Truman knows that he has nuclear bombs to work with
1346480	1348960	or the effectiveness of those nuclear bombs.
1348960	1354160	Before that, he's presenting an invasion as only one possible way forward.
1354160	1358240	At the start of the video, I quoted several US military leaders
1358240	1362480	who thought Japan would have surrendered prior to an invasion being necessary,
1362480	1365120	regardless of the use of nuclear bombs.
1365120	1368240	For example, Admiral Leahy, who described Japan as
1368240	1371200	already defeated and ready to surrender.
1371200	1374160	But just how defeated was Japan?
1374160	1377760	Let's briefly talk about the state of the Japanese military.
1377760	1384480	So firstly, by the middle of 1945, the Japanese Navy was virtually non-existent.
1384480	1388800	Every Japanese aircraft carrier had been either sunk or disabled,
1388800	1391120	hundreds of warships had been destroyed,
1391120	1394080	and after the United States captured Okinawa,
1394080	1397360	Japan's few remaining battleships were either decommissioned
1397360	1400720	or used as stationary anti-aircraft platforms
1400720	1404000	because Japan simply lacked the fuel to keep them moving.
1404000	1406720	Outside of suicide attacks by small vessels,
1406720	1409920	the Japanese Navy had ceased to exist,
1409920	1412560	and that's not a rhetorical flourish by me there,
1412560	1416320	that's a quote from the US summary report of the Pacific War.
1416320	1418880	In the air, Japan was faring no better.
1418880	1422400	There was a shortage of bombers, fighters, trained pilots,
1422400	1427440	materials to construct aircraft out of, and fuel to keep them in the air.
1427440	1429840	As you'll probably be aware, by the end of the war,
1429920	1434720	Japan was resorting to suicide missions carried out by poorly trained pilots
1434720	1438480	instructed to simply crash their planes into enemy ships.
1438480	1441440	Due in part to the rushed training of the pilots
1441440	1445040	and the increasingly poor construction of the aircraft they were flying,
1445040	1448720	fewer than a fifth of these planes actually hit their targets.
1448720	1451120	On the other side, the United States Air Force
1451120	1454880	was conducting constant bombing raids on targets inside Japan,
1454880	1458960	basically as it pleased, meeting little to no resistance in the air.
1458960	1463760	General Curtis LeMay, the man in charge of America's air offensive against Japan,
1463760	1469040	later claimed that he did not lose a single B-29 bomber to Japanese fighters.
1469040	1473200	And to quote the strategic bombing survey I mentioned near the start of the video,
1473200	1476000	United States planes crisscrossed the skies
1476000	1480160	with no effective Japanese air or anti-aircraft opposition.
1480160	1482880	Given its collapse both in the air and at sea,
1482880	1486080	a naval blockade was able to be put in place around Japan,
1486080	1490400	which firstly was absolutely devastating for the Japanese economy.
1490400	1493760	Almost their entire merchant fleet was picked off and destroyed,
1493760	1499680	and imports of vital resources like coal, crude oil, iron ore, and rubber stopped.
1499680	1505520	As a result, many Japanese ports, such as the one at Hiroshima, simply ceased to operate.
1505520	1508640	The blockade also had the effect of dramatically reducing
1508640	1514880	the scattered Japanese ground forces' ability to communicate, resupply, and redeploy.
1514880	1518720	Without their navy, Japan's troops were increasingly under-supplied
1518720	1521360	as well as stranded wherever they happened to be.
1521360	1525680	So, given the absolutely dismal state of the Japanese military situation,
1525680	1528320	it is presumptuous of the Supreme Council to assume
1528320	1532560	that the United States had to commit to a costly ground invasion at all.
1532560	1537920	The Americans could, if they wanted to, simply maintain their naval blockade and bombing campaign,
1537920	1541360	and there would be very little that the Japanese leadership could do about it.
1541360	1545120	They were counting on the United States first launching an invasion,
1545120	1547440	and only then losing faith in it.
1547440	1550720	Of course, another possibility is that the United States could decide
1550720	1554720	they didn't want to do a ground invasion before they'd started one,
1554720	1558960	which is, of course, what happened, but we're getting a little ahead of ourselves there.
1558960	1563280	Now, it is clear from their awful, unsalvageable military situation
1563280	1567760	that Japan's leaders should have surrendered much sooner than they did,
1567760	1569760	and indeed, some wanted to,
1569760	1575600	but so long as the hardline militarist faction in the Supreme Council insisted on continuing the war,
1575600	1579440	there was little that those who desired peace could do about it.
1579440	1581200	Directly, anyway.
1581200	1584240	Behind the scenes, members of the Japanese leadership
1584240	1589600	who realized that the war needed to be finished were working on plans to that end,
1589600	1591680	but we'll get to those in due time.
1591680	1595280	For now, though, the Supreme Council remained deadlocked,
1595280	1600480	and the terribly sad thing about all this is that while the leadership of Japan waited uselessly
1600480	1605520	for either an American ground invasion or rescue from the Soviet Union,
1605520	1609920	their civilian population centers were being systematically destroyed.
1609920	1614320	And here we need to introduce the concept of strategic bombing,
1614320	1619440	that being the intentional targeting of enemy cities with area bombing raids
1619440	1623520	with the aim of destroying the enemy's morale and industry.
1623520	1629600	Now, strategic bombing is interesting in that its name changes depending on who is doing it to whom.
1629600	1634160	When we're doing it to them, it's called strategic or morale bombing,
1634160	1639360	and it's a calculated, emotionless tactic intended to bring a swift end to the war
1639360	1643360	by breaking enemy morale and disrupting their war industry.
1643360	1647680	When they're doing it to us, on the other hand, it's called terror bombing,
1647680	1652400	and it's a cowardly, despicable tactic intended to instill fear in the population
1652480	1655840	by the ruthless slaughter of innocent women and children.
1655840	1658400	It all depends on your point of view, really.
1658400	1663520	The strategy of indiscriminate area bombing had been used prior to World War II,
1663520	1666640	but it was during the war that it really got up to speed.
1666640	1671440	The Nazis were targeting civilians with bombs from the very start of the war,
1671440	1676800	and notably one of the aims of their Blitz bombing campaign against cities in the United Kingdom
1676800	1680160	was to break the morale of the British civilian population.
1680160	1683920	The British Royal Air Force began the war favoring precision,
1683920	1687040	tactical bombing strikes against specific targets,
1687040	1692400	but they soon got with the times and adopted an area bombing strategy against German cities,
1692400	1696960	one of the aims of which was to break the morale of the German civilian population.
1696960	1702560	And there were two main branches of thinking behind making civilians the target of bombing raids.
1702560	1706400	There's the material reasoning and the psychological reasoning,
1706400	1709440	and we'll talk about the material reasoning first.
1709440	1715760	So, why spend time and resources trying to exclusively bomb small, mobile military targets
1715760	1719280	that can fight back when you can just fly behind those targets
1719280	1722800	and bomb the factories and shipyards that are producing them?
1722800	1725840	And those factories and shipyards supplying the military,
1725840	1730160	they're staffed by civilians who usually live in nearby houses.
1730160	1734640	They're also culpable to some degree for keeping the war machine going, right?
1734720	1739280	And if we bomb them, there will be fewer workers to work at those factories,
1739280	1744160	and therefore will reduce the enemy country's production and end the war quicker.
1744160	1747200	So it's not that we want to bomb civilians, you see,
1747200	1751200	it's simply that we think this will be less painful in the long run.
1751200	1756800	Now, cities aren't solely comprised of war factories and worker housing, of course.
1756800	1758960	But all the other things in the city,
1758960	1762400	the non-military industries that keep those workers alive,
1762400	1765520	the hospitals that heal them when they're sick and injured,
1765520	1768320	the schools that educate their children,
1768320	1771760	all these things are connected in varying degrees
1771760	1775440	to the functioning of that society's capacity for war.
1775440	1779680	So, following this logic, you can just bomb everything
1779680	1784160	by, in effect, reclassifying everything in the city as a military target.
1784720	1788000	Once you've done this, bombing civilians is impossible,
1788000	1789840	because there are no civilians.
1789840	1793360	The city is just one big military installation.
1793360	1798800	Now, it is worth noting here that the United States did not enter the war with this mindset.
1798800	1802640	In 1939, President Roosevelt sent an appeal to
1802640	1806720	refrain from air bombing of civilians to various countries,
1806720	1808160	and that reads as follows.
1808160	1813040	"...the ruthless bombing from the air of civilians in unfortified centers of population
1813040	1817040	during the course of hostilities which have raged in various quarters of the earth
1817040	1820960	during the past few years, which has resulted in the maiming and in the death
1820960	1824080	of thousands of defenseless men, women and children,
1824080	1827600	has sickened the hearts of every civilized man and woman
1827600	1830880	and has profoundly shocked the conscience of humanity."
1830880	1834400	If resort is had to this form of inhuman barbarism
1834400	1839040	during the period of the tragic conflagration with which the world is now confronted,
1839040	1843280	hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings who have no responsibility for,
1843280	1846080	and who are not even remotely participating in,
1846080	1849920	the hostilities which have now broken out, will lose their lives.
1849920	1853360	"...I am therefore addressing this urgent appeal to every government
1853360	1857680	which may be engaged in hostilities publicly to affirm its determination
1857680	1862800	that its armed forces shall in no event and under no circumstances
1862800	1867040	undertake the bombardment from the air of civilian populations."
1867040	1872400	So, some very high-minded words from a leader not yet in the war there.
1872400	1875840	A few years later, however, the United States was in the war
1875840	1879280	and its military leaders saw things a little differently.
1879280	1881680	And to quote General Curtis LeMay,
1881680	1883920	"...there are no innocent civilians.
1883920	1886720	It is their government and you are fighting a people.
1886720	1889520	You are not trying to fight an armed force anymore,
1889520	1894880	so it doesn't bother me so much to be killing the so-called innocent bystanders."
1894880	1899200	LeMay's bombing strategy proceeded exactly as if he rarely believed
1899200	1901920	there were no innocent civilians in Japan.
1901920	1904640	Once Allied bombers were able to reach Japan,
1904640	1908240	mass fire bombings of Japanese population centers began,
1908240	1911680	killing and displacing hundreds of thousands of civilians.
1911680	1914640	The fire bombing of Tokyo on the 9th and 10th of March
1914640	1920800	killed an estimated 100,000 people by itself and made a million more homeless.
1920800	1922720	So, in the course of just a few years,
1922720	1926880	the bombing of innocent civilians went from inhuman barbarism
1926880	1929520	to there are no innocent civilians.
1929520	1932800	Civilians were just another military asset to be bombed
1932800	1935520	as far as the Allied air force was concerned.
1935520	1938400	Now, the other line of reasoning for strategic bombing
1938400	1940720	was the possible psychological effects
1940720	1944160	that would result from the bombing of civilian population centers.
1944160	1948080	Those being that perhaps the population would lose faith in their government
1948080	1950880	or the soldiers on the front lines would be demoralized
1950880	1953920	by their families and homes being bombed while they were away,
1953920	1959200	and all this would therefore lead to an increased likelihood for the enemy to surrender.
1959280	1961680	And the material reasoning for the bombing
1961680	1966960	was often used merely as a pretext for this actual psychological aim.
1966960	1971360	Winston Churchill let this slip in a memo he drafted on the 28th of March
1971360	1974560	in which he addresses the controversial bombing of Dresden
1974560	1978560	which took place between the 13th and 15th of February.
1978560	1980880	In this memo, Churchill says,
1980880	1982960	"...it seems to me that the moment has come
1982960	1985520	when the question of bombing of German cities
1985520	1988560	simply for the sake of increasing the terror,
1988560	1992160	though under other pretexts, should be reviewed.
1992160	1996000	Otherwise, we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land.
1996000	1998640	The foreign secretary has spoken to me on this subject
1998640	2002720	and I feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives
2002720	2006480	such as oil and communications behind the immediate battle zone
2006480	2011520	rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive."
2012080	2016240	So, bombing simply for the sake of increasing the terror,
2016240	2018560	though under other pretexts.
2018560	2021360	So you're bombing civilians to break enemy morale
2021360	2023680	and if anyone gets squeamish about that, you say,
2023680	2027120	oh, don't worry, I know we hit a few schools and hospitals there
2027120	2030400	but we were actually aiming at that factory a few streets over
2030400	2033360	that makes boots for the army or something.
2033360	2038240	Every city had something or other in it that supported the armed forces in some way,
2038240	2044000	and thus there was always a handy excuse for indiscriminately area bombing anywhere.
2044000	2048480	Now this strategy is, and was at the time, very controversial,
2048480	2050320	not just from a moral standpoint,
2050320	2053440	I mean, that's obvious, you're blowing up innocent people,
2053440	2056720	but it was also controversial in terms of its effectiveness.
2056720	2061360	And first let's talk about the effectiveness of area bombing's material goals.
2061360	2065760	Firstly, even with the enormous amount of bombs which were dropped on Nazi Germany,
2065760	2069440	the country's production actually increased throughout the war.
2069440	2071120	And this happened for a few reasons,
2071680	2076480	one of which was that Nazi Germany used millions of people as slave labor.
2076480	2079760	Many German factories were staffed by prisoners.
2079760	2083600	When you're a fascist regime occupying whole other countries,
2083600	2085440	lives are very cheap.
2085440	2088560	Also, whatever damage was done to German industry
2088560	2093200	during indiscriminate area bombing raids on cities was relatively minor,
2093200	2096240	because, to quote the Strategic Bombing Survey,
2104240	2107920	Now you could say Nazi Germany's production would have increased further
2107920	2109840	without the area bombings, of course,
2109840	2112400	but we're not talking about reducing production,
2112400	2116000	then we're talking about slowing down the increase of production,
2116000	2120160	which is less likely to be a major contributing factor to a surrender.
2120240	2125200	We also have to consider here that while your air force is bombing civilian housing
2125200	2127280	with the aim of breaking their morale,
2127280	2131040	they're not bombing other things which it might be more useful to bomb.
2131040	2134800	The Strategic Bombing Survey concludes that Allied bombing raids on,
2134800	2139200	for instance, the Nazis oil refineries and transportation network,
2139200	2141680	were key to hastening the end of the war.
2141680	2146000	In particular, it calls the targeting of Germany's railways and waterways
2146000	2150400	the decisive blow that completely disorganized the German economy.
2150400	2155760	It also concludes that the importance of careful selection of targets for air attack
2155760	2158480	is emphasized by the German experience.
2158480	2161840	The Germans were far more concerned over attacks on one or more
2161840	2164400	of their basic industries and services,
2164400	2166640	their oil, chemical, or steel industries,
2166640	2169120	or their power or transportation network,
2169120	2173920	than they were over attacks on their armament industry or the city areas.
2173920	2177680	So the specific targeting of key industries and transport networks
2177680	2180720	was more effective than indiscriminate area bombing
2180720	2183760	and the destruction of civilian housing, basically.
2183760	2187680	Next, let's talk about the psychological effectiveness of area bombing.
2187680	2192320	The thinking that area bombing would lead to a surrender caused by a breakdown in morale
2192320	2194240	turned out to have a few flaws.
2194240	2196560	Firstly, on the government end,
2196560	2200160	militaristic, totalitarian, fascist regimes
2200160	2204080	don't care about the opinions or well-being of their civilians.
2204080	2206160	So they're not likely to throw in the towel
2206160	2210640	just because lots of ordinary people are getting killed or injured or made homeless.
2210640	2212160	They don't care about that.
2212160	2218560	Caring about people is not high on the list of priorities for totalitarian fascist regimes.
2218560	2221040	On the civilian end, there's several reasons
2221040	2224800	why trying to break their morale didn't lead to the end of the war.
2224800	2228000	You know, beyond their government's not caring what they think.
2228000	2232240	Firstly, as much as people might be terrorized by indiscriminate bombing raids,
2232240	2236000	they were also already being terrorized by their own governments
2236000	2238000	and the police force of those governments.
2238000	2240080	It's one thing to have your morale shaken
2240080	2242720	and decide things would be better if Hitler was gone,
2242720	2247600	and it's another thing to translate that into action and go and fight the Gestapo.
2247600	2251440	Someone might not like having their city bombed and their house burnt down,
2251440	2253840	but that doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna go out
2253840	2257200	and rebel against the government and risk being executed.
2257200	2261120	This is Arthur Harris, perhaps better known as Bomber Harris,
2261120	2263920	who was the commander-in-chief of RAF Bomber Command
2263920	2266000	during the height of the Second World War,
2266000	2270560	and he oversaw the United Kingdom's area bombing campaign against German cities,
2270560	2272640	including the bombing of Dresden.
2272640	2275440	Now, as you might be able to tell from his nickname,
2275440	2279760	Bomber Harris was a very enthusiastic supporter of area bombing,
2279760	2282640	and he was also a very enthusiastic supporter
2282640	2285920	of being honest about the point of area bombing.
2285920	2289200	And let's read a quote of his from 1943.
2289200	2293840	"...the aim of the combined bomber offensive should be unambiguously stated
2293840	2297600	as the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers,
2297600	2300560	and the disruption of civilized life throughout Germany.
2300560	2304960	The destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives,
2304960	2308480	the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale,
2308480	2311840	and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battlefronts
2311920	2315040	by fear of extended and intensified bombing
2315040	2318880	are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy.
2318880	2322800	They are not byproducts of attempts to hit factories."
2322800	2326960	So when he said this, he was clearly in favor of area bombing as a tactic,
2326960	2330560	and also in favor of being honest about the aim of it.
2330560	2335760	The point was to disrupt civilian life, kill people, and spread fear.
2335760	2340160	However, after the war, Bomber Harris changed his mind.
2340160	2343680	In his 1947 book, Bomber Offensive,
2343680	2347920	Harris writes that while in 1941 it had seemed like a good idea
2347920	2350640	to use area bombing to break the enemy's morale,
2350640	2354240	in the long run it proved to be wholly unsound.
2354240	2355200	And I quote,
2355200	2359360	"...when we had destroyed almost all the larger industrial cities in Germany,
2359360	2362080	the civil population remained apathetic,
2362080	2364800	while the Gestapo saw to it that they were docile,
2364800	2368720	and insofar as there was work left for them to do, industrious."
2368720	2371200	Morale bombing was comparatively ineffective
2371200	2374400	against so well organized a police state as Germany.
2374400	2377120	The German leaders themselves admitted after the war
2377120	2380240	that morale was bad after our attacks on their towns,
2380240	2384720	but they distinguished between the morale and the conduct of the workers.
2384720	2387520	Conduct, they say, was unaffected.
2387520	2391120	In other words, there was nothing unarmed Germans could do about it
2391120	2396240	with the Gestapo standing by and with the concentration camp round the corner.
2396960	2399200	So that's the failure of morale bombing
2399200	2402560	from someone who was previously both very in favor of it
2402560	2405200	and directly responsible for it there.
2405200	2409360	And the Strategic Bombing Survey also covers the same topic, saying,
2409360	2412000	"...if they," that's the German civilians,
2412000	2414880	"...had been at liberty to vote themselves out of the war,
2414880	2418000	they would have done so well before the final surrender.
2418000	2420320	In a determined police state, however,
2420320	2425520	there is a wide difference between dissatisfaction and expressed opposition."
2425520	2429280	About the nicest thing you can say about this morale bombing idea
2429280	2433920	is that some people apparently thought it might work, but it didn't.
2433920	2436720	And it just so happens that in the course of it not working,
2436720	2439280	it pointlessly killed, injured, and displaced
2439280	2441760	a very large number of innocent civilians.
2441760	2444480	Attempts to break the morale of the German citizenry
2444480	2449440	with terror bombing tactics led to apathy, not revolutionary action.
2449440	2452480	And not to get too armchair general on you all here,
2452480	2457200	but I don't mind concluding that every single bomb that was dropped on a German house
2457200	2461760	would have been better put to use if it was dropped instead on a German railway line
2461760	2465040	or something else of actual military significance.
2465040	2468800	However, I would like to make clear here that by no means am I saying
2468800	2473840	we should absolve the entire German citizenry of all fault in the Second World War.
2474400	2478560	Many civilians were, of course, committed supporters of the Nazi Party
2478560	2481920	and often participants in its various crimes.
2481920	2486800	When I say innocent civilians, I absolutely do not mean those people.
2486800	2489840	However, many German citizens were innocent,
2489840	2492560	many were persecuted by the Nazis themselves,
2492560	2494800	or many were children, for instance,
2494800	2500400	and sadly, indiscriminate area bombing does not discern between these groups of people.
2500400	2502880	Now, all this is important for us today
2502880	2506160	because the manner in which the atomic bombs were targeted and used
2506160	2510240	was merely an extension of this morale bombing philosophy.
2510240	2512320	So let's talk a little about that.
2512320	2514800	In the months before the atomic bomb was used,
2514800	2518960	a group of scientists and military personnel dubbed the Target Committee
2518960	2523760	was established by director of the Manhattan Project, General Leslie Groves,
2523760	2528160	and this group met several times to discuss how the bombs should be used.
2528160	2531040	And the minutes of the meetings of the Target Committee
2531040	2536160	give us an insight into the thinking behind the target selection for the bombs.
2536160	2540240	On the 10th of May, the group met in the office of J. Robert Oppenheimer,
2540240	2542800	who was the head of the laboratory that designed the bombs
2542800	2545440	and one of the scientists on the committee.
2545440	2548960	And they discussed various points relating to how the bomb should be used.
2549520	2552000	One key point for us here is the section
2552000	2557040	Psychological Factors in Target Selection, and that reads as follows.
2557040	2562880	It was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance.
2562880	2568400	Two aspects of this are one, obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan,
2568400	2572880	and two, making the initial use sufficiently spectacular
2572880	2576320	for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized
2576320	2578800	when publicity on it is released.
2578800	2581920	So when picking targets here, they're not just thinking
2581920	2585360	about the psychological effects upon the inhabitants of Japan,
2585360	2590320	they're also already thinking about the effects the bomb will have outside of the war.
2590320	2593920	They want the bomb to be sufficiently spectacular,
2593920	2597120	like they're setting off a big firework or something.
2597120	2602400	Furthermore, still under the psychological factors heading regarding Hiroshima,
2602400	2606880	it was put forward that Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size
2606880	2610000	and with possible focusing from nearby mountains
2610000	2614320	that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed.
2614320	2616560	That's an advantage, remember.
2616560	2622880	So in picking Hiroshima as a target, they were aiming to destroy a large fraction of the city
2622880	2626880	due specifically to the associated psychological factors.
2626880	2630720	Reading these minutes, it is clear that the members of the target committee
2630720	2634240	were much more focused on the psychological effects of the bomb
2634240	2639040	than its practical physical effects upon Japan's military capabilities.
2639040	2640800	Regarding this, they write,
2640800	2645600	Use against military objectives. Nice use of quotation marks there.
2645600	2648320	It was agreed that for the initial use of the weapon,
2648320	2653920	any small and strictly military objective should be located in a much larger area
2653920	2657600	subject to blast damage in order to avoid undue risks
2657600	2661360	of the weapon being lost due to bad placing of the bomb.
2661360	2665280	So they didn't want to bomb an isolated, strictly military target
2665280	2668080	for fear of missing and losing the weapon.
2668080	2670080	Whereas if they drop the bomb on a city,
2670080	2673920	missing their air quotes, military target is just fine
2673920	2677760	because a large fraction of the city will still be destroyed regardless
2677760	2682720	and therefore the bomb will still convey the very important psychological effects.
2682720	2685680	Now, I don't know any way of reading this other than
2685680	2689280	it's okay if we don't actually hit a military objective
2689280	2691520	so long as we still hit a city.
2691520	2695200	Actual material effects upon Japan's military capabilities
2695200	2698000	were clearly not of prime importance here.
2698000	2701520	It is very telling that the top of their target list was Kyoto,
2701520	2706320	the former capital of Japan, which was of relatively little military significance
2706320	2709280	but enormous psychological importance.
2709280	2715360	They also include the ludicrous reasoning that since Kyoto is an intellectual center for Japan,
2715360	2720320	the people there are more apt to appreciate the significance of such a weapon,
2720320	2724720	as if the inhabitants of the other cities of Japan would be simply too unintelligent
2724800	2729040	to understand the significance of their city being exploded.
2729040	2732800	In the end, of course, Kyoto was not hit with an atomic bomb.
2732800	2736160	General Leslie Groves wanted very much to bomb Kyoto,
2736160	2740480	but after a lot of stalling, it was reluctantly taken off the list of targets
2740480	2745200	on the persistent and repeated orders of Secretary of War Henry Stimson,
2745200	2750800	who, and yes, this is the actual reason, once went there on holiday.
2750800	2754160	At a meeting of the Interim Committee on the 31st of May,
2754160	2759840	Stimson described Kyoto as exclusively a place of homes and art and shrines,
2759840	2762560	and argued it must not be bombed.
2762560	2766800	The minutes of this meeting on the 31st of May reveal the confusing
2766800	2770720	and contradictory list of requirements for the bomb targets.
2770720	2772480	And let's read a little from the section
2772480	2776320	Effect of the Bombing on the Japanese and Their Will to Fight.
2776320	2781200	After much discussion concerning various types of targets and the effects to be produced,
2781200	2785280	the Secretary expressed the conclusion, on which there was general agreement,
2785280	2788000	that we could not give the Japanese any warning,
2788000	2790960	that we could not concentrate on a civilian area,
2790960	2794560	but that we should seek to make a profound psychological impression
2794560	2797200	on as many of the inhabitants as possible.
2797200	2799600	Now, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
2800160	2803760	If you aren't concentrating upon a civilian area,
2803760	2809200	how do you make a profound psychological impression upon as many inhabitants as possible?
2809200	2812800	It's not going to make much of an impression on the Japanese population
2812800	2818000	if you drop the bomb on some isolated military target somewhere where no one will see it.
2818000	2821280	It would just be one more thing that got bombed that day.
2821280	2824080	This was brought up in the meeting when someone, quote,
2824080	2826960	"...pointed out that one atomic bomb dropped on an arsenal
2826960	2832160	would not be much different from the effect caused by any air core strike of present dimensions.
2832160	2838080	However, Dr. Oppenheimer stated that the visual effect of an atomic bombing would be tremendous.
2838080	2840720	It would be accompanied by a brilliant luminescence,
2840720	2844080	which would rise to a height of 10,000 to 20,000 feet."
2844080	2848160	So that's the key thing here that's supposed to differentiate the nuclear bombs
2848160	2850000	from the conventional bombing raids.
2850000	2854240	It's not the material effect upon Japanese military capabilities,
2854240	2856080	it's how impressive they look.
2856080	2859760	Now, of course, if you want to create a profound psychological effect
2859760	2862160	with your big, impressive-looking bomb,
2862160	2865200	you need to drop it somewhere where people can see it.
2865200	2868800	So how do you drop the bomb on a strictly military target
2868800	2874080	while ensuring there are lots of Japanese inhabitants around to see how tremendous it is?
2874080	2878720	The members of the meeting wriggled their way out of this conundrum with the following euphemism.
2879280	2885280	The most desirable target would be a vital war plant employing a large number of workers
2885280	2888480	and closely surrounded by workers' houses.
2889040	2892000	So we're not bombing a civilian area, to be clear.
2892000	2894560	We are not aiming at houses.
2894560	2899040	We're aiming at a factory closely surrounded by houses.
2899040	2901680	And if we happen to miss the factory, that's okay.
2901680	2906560	We won't lose the bomb because it will still destroy a large fraction of the city, remember.
2906560	2910400	But again, we're not targeting the civilians, we promise.
2911040	2914080	What a load of rubbish, honestly.
2914080	2918640	They want to bomb civilians, they have decided to bomb civilians,
2918640	2922240	and they know it, but they're too cowardly to admit it.
2922240	2924960	So they're pretending the desired effects of the bomb
2924960	2930800	will merely be the byproduct of an attempt to hit a factory, as Bomber Harris put it.
2930800	2934560	Now Secretary Stimpson went along with this ridiculous euphemism,
2934560	2938640	or at least contented himself with having saved his pet city of Kyoto.
2939360	2942560	The other target cities were placed on a no bomb list,
2942560	2945360	meaning that they were not to be targeted by the Air Force
2945360	2949520	with conventional bombings prior to being hit with the atomic bombs.
2949520	2953440	This was because another desired attribute of the potential bomb targets
2953440	2956880	was that they were, as far as possible, undamaged,
2956880	2961360	so as to better demonstrate the destructive power of the atomic bomb.
2961360	2964880	They want a spectacular show, after all.
2964880	2968000	Now this requirement speaks to the relative military
2968000	2971600	unimportance of the cities that ended up making the list.
2971600	2977120	They were thus far undamaged, in part because they were not high-priority military targets.
2977120	2979120	This is something for us to keep in mind
2979120	2982160	when considering those justifications for the atomic bombs
2982160	2987040	that highlight whatever military industry existed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
2987040	2990000	Because whatever military industry existed in those cities
2990000	2993440	did so specifically because they were not being attacked,
2993440	2996560	initially because of the city's relative unimportance
2996560	2999040	compared with higher value bombing targets,
2999040	3002320	and following that because they were on this no bomb list.
3002320	3007040	Allied bombers had attacked dozens of Japanese cities with conventional weapons.
3007200	3011760	Tokyo was extensively firebombed months before the atomic bombs were dropped.
3011760	3016320	There was nothing stopping Allied bombers from also attacking the list of target cities
3016320	3020000	if they were supposed to be so important to Japan's military efforts,
3020000	3023520	except for the fact that they were being preserved, on purpose,
3023520	3025840	to be destroyed with atomic bombs.
3025840	3030080	Now, of course, before the bomb was used in the field, it was first tested.
3030080	3035120	And the timing of the first nuclear test detonation, codenamed the Trinity Test,
3035120	3037600	caused a problem for President Truman,
3037600	3040240	as the upcoming Potsdam Conference in Germany
3040240	3043200	meant that he personally would be out of the country.
3043200	3046160	Truman actually wanted to delay the Potsdam Conference
3046160	3048640	until a little while after the Trinity Test,
3048640	3052640	so that he would know, going into diplomatic negotiations there,
3052640	3055440	whether or not he had the nuclear bombs to play with.
3055440	3059840	But he had to settle for getting the news while he was at the conference.
3059840	3062640	Now, before we get into talking about the Potsdam Conference,
3062720	3066240	I'd just like to recap what our principal actors are up to here.
3066880	3071840	So, Truman was stating his intent to get Russia to commit to the Japanese war,
3071840	3076160	and he later wrote that it was his main objective in going to Potsdam.
3076160	3079440	The Soviet Union was ignoring Japan's peace feelers
3079440	3082320	and, per the secret agreement they made at Yalta,
3082320	3087840	preparing to void the non-aggression pact they had with Japan and invade Manchuria.
3087840	3091440	Japan was organizing a diplomatic mission to travel to Moscow
3091440	3093200	and meet with Stalin directly,
3093200	3097280	in order to hopefully convince him to negotiate an end to the war.
3097280	3101120	This diplomatic mission was led by Prince Fumimaro Konoe.
3101120	3105280	Now, Konoe was a prestigious politician and former prime minister
3105280	3109360	who, prior to the war, had advised against attacking America.
3109360	3111440	He thought Pearl Harbor was a mistake,
3111440	3114560	and he was very critical of the hardline militarists,
3114560	3118480	stating in a report to the Emperor in February of 1945
3118480	3122480	that they were the greatest obstacle to a termination of the conflict,
3122480	3124800	and that, even though they knew they would lose,
3124800	3127760	they are likely to continue fighting to the very end,
3127760	3129520	merely to save face.
3129520	3133280	So, the selection of this chap to head the diplomatic mission to Russia
3133280	3135280	sends a clear message here.
3135280	3137760	The Emperor wants the war over,
3137760	3141520	and he wants to send Konoe to talk to Stalin to get it done.
3141520	3143680	To prepare for the arrival of this mission,
3143680	3147680	Togo messaged Sato to set up a meeting between Konoe and Stalin,
3147680	3150800	and sent ahead the text of a message from the Emperor himself
3150800	3152960	that Konoe was to bring with him.
3152960	3155280	And this message reads as follows.
3155280	3156960	"'His Majesty the Emperor,
3156960	3161600	mindful of the fact that the present war daily brings greater evil and sacrifice
3161600	3164080	upon the peoples of all the belligerent powers,
3164080	3168240	desires from his heart that it may be quickly terminated.
3168240	3170800	But so long as England and the United States
3170800	3172880	insist upon unconditional surrender,
3172880	3177280	the Japanese Empire has no alternative but to fight on with all its strength
3177360	3180080	for the honor and existence of the Motherland.'"
3180080	3184160	Now, Stalin got this message, but made no immediate response.
3184160	3186960	He, too, was heading to the Potsdam Conference,
3186960	3189360	and that's what we're going to talk about next.
3189360	3191360	So, the Potsdam Conference took place
3191360	3194800	between the 17th of July and the 2nd of August.
3194800	3197360	Now, this conference was similar to the Yalta Conference
3197360	3200400	in that it was a meeting of the leaders of the Soviet Union,
3200400	3202560	United Kingdom, and United States
3202560	3207120	to discuss various matters related to the post-war organization of Europe.
3207200	3209840	However, in the time between the two conferences,
3209840	3212320	a few important things had changed.
3212320	3213840	Firstly, as we've mentioned,
3213840	3216800	the US President and Secretary of State had changed,
3216800	3220080	and Truman and Burns wanted a harder line on Russia.
3220080	3222160	We don't need to get too deep into it here,
3222160	3224400	but negotiations with the Soviet Union
3224400	3226960	regarding various matters related to Europe
3226960	3229120	had become increasingly difficult.
3229120	3231840	Plus, the Nazis were out of the war by now,
3231840	3234640	which meant there was less incentive for the other Allies
3234640	3237040	to concede to Stalin's demands.
3237120	3241280	Another important change was the completion of the Nuclear Bomb Project.
3241280	3245680	The Trinity Test was conducted early in the morning on the 16th of July,
3245680	3248240	just prior to the Potsdam Conference,
3248240	3249920	and the test was a success.
3249920	3252560	The Manhattan Project scientists demonstrated
3252560	3255280	that they could detonate a nuclear bomb.
3255280	3257600	Now, though the leadership of the United States
3257600	3261200	had intended to get the Soviet Union into the war against Japan,
3261200	3262720	all the things we just mentioned
3262720	3265920	contributed to an important shift in opinion on that issue
3265920	3268160	that was going on behind the scenes.
3268160	3271920	And two diary entries written by President Truman at Potsdam
3271920	3274320	make clear this shift in opinion.
3274320	3276720	The first comes on the 17th of July,
3276720	3279360	when Truman met Stalin for the first time,
3279360	3281200	and they discussed various matters,
3281200	3283920	including Russia's entry into the war against Japan.
3284480	3287200	Truman's diary account of the conversation reports
3287200	3288560	that Stalin will, quote,
3288560	3292080	"...be in the Japanese War on August 15th."
3292080	3295200	Finny the Japanese when that comes about,
3295200	3298880	although Truman uses a free letter shorthand for Japanese
3298880	3302480	that I won't repeat here on account of it being a racial slur.
3302480	3306320	So the indication from this diary entry on the 17th of July
3306320	3310080	is that Truman thinks that Japan is close to being finished off,
3310080	3314560	and that Soviet entry into the war is what is going to do it.
3314560	3317920	And he furthermore wrote a letter to his wife while at Potsdam,
3317920	3320560	stating, "...I had gotten what I came for.
3320560	3324640	Stalin goes to war on August 15th with no strings on it."
3324640	3328240	And he goes on to mention how this means he thinks the war will be shorter
3328240	3330960	and fewer lives will be lost as a result.
3330960	3336000	So Truman seems positively enthusiastic about Soviet entry into the war right here,
3336000	3338320	and it is interesting to note that Truman's belief
3338320	3341840	that Japan will be finished off by a Soviet declaration of war
3341840	3346960	means that he already thinks a US invasion of Japan is unnecessary.
3346960	3351760	The second entry into Truman's diary I want to talk about comes the very next day.
3351760	3357360	Now, Truman had been informed of the success of the Trinity test already on the 16th of July,
3357360	3360560	but it's here on the 18th that he first gets an indication
3360560	3363280	of just how powerful the atomic bomb was.
3363280	3367040	Henry Stimson received a coded message describing an explosion
3367040	3369520	that could be seen for hundreds of miles,
3369520	3372400	and he relayed this to Truman, who he described as
3372400	3377120	"...greatly reinforced and highly delighted upon hearing the news."
3377120	3381280	And writing in this diary on this day, Truman says the following,
3381360	3385360	"...believed the Japanese will fold up before Russia comes in.
3385360	3390240	I am sure they will when Manhattan appears over their homeland."
3390240	3395280	So here, Truman is presenting the bombs as an event that will preempt a Russian invasion
3395280	3399040	as the thing that will cause the Japanese to fold up.
3399040	3401600	This was an opinion shared by James Burns,
3401600	3405760	who later wrote in his memoirs that, during the Potsdam Conference, quote,
3405760	3409920	"...I would have been satisfied had the Russians determined not to enter the war.
3409920	3413200	Notwithstanding Japan's persistent refusal to surrender,
3413200	3416000	I believed the atomic bomb would be successful
3416000	3419680	and would force the Japanese to accept surrender on our terms.
3420240	3424480	I feared what would happen when the Red Army entered Manchuria."
3424480	3429280	James Burns also rather candidly admitted in a post-war interview that, quote,
3429280	3432640	"...it was ever-present in my mind that it was important
3432640	3435840	that we have an end to the war before the Russians came in.
3435840	3439760	Neither the president nor I were anxious to have them enter the war
3439760	3442560	after we'd learned of this successful test."
3442560	3447200	So here, Burns is directly tying the desire to keep the Russians out of the war
3447200	3449840	to the news coming in from the Trinity test.
3449840	3453680	And Walter Brown, who was assistant to James Burns at Potsdam,
3453680	3456320	wrote in his diary on the 24th of July
3456320	3460160	that Burns told him he believed that, after the atomic bomb was dropped,
3460160	3465280	Japan will surrender and Russia will not get in so much on the kill.
3465280	3468960	So the plan was to get Russia to invade Manchuria,
3468960	3471280	something that would likely finish the war.
3471280	3473680	But finishing the war with Russia's help
3473680	3478480	does mean having to deal with Stalin being at the negotiating table afterwards.
3478480	3482320	And given the difficulty of how the European negotiations are going,
3482320	3484800	and how Roosevelt, God rest his soul,
3484800	3488640	has already gone and promised Stalin a bunch of concessions for helping out,
3489280	3491360	maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing
3491360	3494960	if Russia ended up not being necessary here after all.
3494960	3497840	And since the Trinity test was just a big success,
3497840	3501520	we now have these very destructive nuclear bombs to play with.
3501520	3503680	And maybe when we use these,
3503680	3507120	Japan might surrender, to us specifically,
3507120	3509680	before Russia even declares war.
3509680	3511840	And wouldn't that be handy?
3511840	3516560	And I'd like to point out two more things about this diary entry on July the 18th.
3516560	3518160	The first is that Truman writes
3518160	3522400	he believes the Japanese will fold up before Russia comes in.
3522400	3523520	He does not write,
3523520	3528720	I believe the Japanese will fold up before a US invasion of Japan is necessary.
3528720	3534160	An invasion of Japan is already off the table here, as far as Truman is concerned.
3534160	3536480	Truman and Barnes are not presenting the bombs
3536480	3540800	as an alternative to a US invasion of Japan as a means to end the war.
3540800	3543120	They are presenting the bombs as an alternative
3543120	3547600	to a Soviet invasion of Manchuria as a means to end the war.
3547600	3550640	The second thing I'd like to point out about this diary entry
3550640	3553360	is that Truman writes the Japanese will fold up
3553360	3556080	when Manhattan appears over their homeland.
3556080	3558880	And that's when, not if.
3558880	3561200	Truman writes about the use of the nuclear bombs
3561200	3564160	as a thing that simply is going to happen,
3564160	3567120	and then he speculates about the effects they will have.
3567120	3572080	Nowhere here is the thought that the bombs might possibly not need to be used.
3572080	3574480	As Truman later states in his memoirs,
3574480	3577200	I regarded the bomb as a military weapon
3577200	3580400	and never had any doubt that it should be used.
3580400	3584480	And this is concerning in light of the fact that on July 18th,
3584480	3588960	Truman learned of the message that the Kanoe mission was to deliver to Stalin.
3588960	3592000	After meeting with Churchill, Truman notes in his diary
3592000	3596240	that Stalin had told PM, that's Prime Minister Churchill,
3596240	3600080	of telegram from the Japanese emperor asking for peace.
3600720	3603360	Stalin also read his answer to me.
3603360	3605280	It was satisfactory.
3605280	3608560	As for what Stalin's satisfactory answer was,
3608560	3613280	we can read this account of Admiral Leahy's of a meeting ten days later.
3613280	3617520	Stalin enlivened the proceedings by reporting that on July 18th,
3617520	3622880	he had received a request from Japan to mediate for them with the Allies to end the war.
3622880	3625440	He said this request included a proposal
3625440	3629360	to send a royal prince of Japan to Moscow as chief of the mission.
3629360	3633280	The Generalissimo said that his reply was that the proposal was too vague
3633280	3636480	to warrant his approving a meeting with the proposed mission.
3636480	3640880	Stalin then says that he had that day received another message from Japan
3640880	3643520	attempting to clarify the purpose of the mission,
3643520	3647040	but that he was going to send the Japanese the same response.
3647040	3651600	Leahy concludes that it was clearly evident that Stalin was at that time
3651600	3654080	determined to enter the war against Japan,
3654080	3659680	which plainly was to the advantage of Russia now that Japan was certain to be defeated.
3659680	3664960	So Tokyo is sending messages to Stalin asking for him to mediate and enter the war,
3664960	3670560	and he's avoiding answering them directly and instead repeatedly asking for clarifications,
3670560	3674080	and he's clearly just buying time while he prepares for an invasion.
3674640	3676640	More like Joseph Stalling.
3677520	3681440	Anyway, to get back on track, President Truman knows at Potsdam
3681440	3686240	that the Japanese leadership are, in his words, asking for peace.
3686800	3689600	So given that, why, we might wonder,
3689600	3694080	was there no doubt in Truman's mind about the need to set off nuclear bombs
3694080	3696800	in the middle of civilian population centers?
3696800	3702000	Now, we could simply say that Truman had resolved to drop the atomic bomb on civilians
3702000	3705680	in order to force a Japanese surrender on favorable terms
3705680	3708960	before the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria.
3708960	3712320	However, this interpretation of events seemingly conflicts
3712320	3716480	with another diary entry that Truman wrote on the 25th of July,
3716480	3719600	when, talking about the upcoming bombings, he says,
3719600	3724240	This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10th.
3724240	3727120	I have told the Secretary of War, Mr. Stimson,
3727120	3732400	to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target,
3732400	3734800	and not women and children.
3734800	3736560	He and I are in accord.
3736560	3739760	The target will be a purely military one.
3739760	3742000	So, what's going on here?
3742560	3744560	Truman states in this diary entry
3744560	3748560	that the bomb is going to be used against a purely military target.
3749200	3751440	Now, by no stretch of the imagination
3751440	3754320	can the middle of a civilian population center
3754320	3757200	be considered a purely military target.
3757200	3760080	It is, in fact, the exact place you would drop the bomb
3760080	3762960	if you were trying to target women and children.
3762960	3766480	If the middle of a city counts as a purely military target,
3766480	3768560	then there is nowhere the bomb could be dropped
3768560	3771360	that would not count as a purely military target,
3771360	3776480	making the question of whether to drop it on a purely military target or not completely pointless.
3776480	3778640	And he's talking to Henry Stimson,
3778640	3782320	who, of course, knows the bomb is going to be dropped on a city,
3782320	3786400	but has apparently tricked himself into believing the lazy euphemism
3786400	3792320	about a war plant surrounded by workers' houses being a purely military target.
3792320	3795680	Truman and Stimson are acting like the bomb is going to be dropped
3795680	3798400	on a military base or an airfield or something,
3798400	3802880	and then patting themselves on the back for not dropping it on civilians.
3802880	3805760	For whatever reason, Truman is thinking about the bomb
3805760	3808960	as though it is only going to affect enemy soldiers.
3808960	3812720	He seems to understand that it would be wrong to drop the bomb on civilians,
3812720	3815840	but not that that is exactly what is about to happen.
3815840	3820720	As for why this is, there are three possible explanations that I can imagine.
3820720	3825520	The first is that Truman genuinely thinks the bomb is not going to be dropped on civilians
3825520	3829360	and that the target list only includes military bases or something.
3829360	3832160	In this version of events, Truman is told by Stimson
3832160	3835600	that the bomb is going to be dropped on a purely military target,
3835600	3840800	believes him, and is later surprised by the fact the bombs have actually been dropped on civilians.
3840800	3846240	And so he orders that no more nuclear bombs should be dropped without his express permission,
3846240	3850560	which is something he did do after the second bomb was dropped, by the way.
3850560	3853920	Then I guess he realizes that he's massively screwed up,
3853920	3857440	but decides to just run with it and pretend that was the plan all along,
3857440	3861440	because that's easier at that point than admitting the enormous incompetence
3861440	3867120	and being like, sorry, I didn't actually mean to blow up two cities, that's my bad.
3867120	3871040	The second explanation is that Truman is simply deluding himself.
3871040	3876000	He knows exactly what the target is, but he's convincing himself it's something else.
3876000	3882240	If he really thought about it, he'd know that the bomb was not going to land on a purely military target,
3882240	3885440	so he's not thinking about it, and he's deceiving himself.
3885440	3890320	The third explanation I can imagine is that Truman is just consciously lying.
3890320	3894400	He knows the bomb is not going to be dropped on a purely military target,
3894400	3899200	but he's falsely claiming that that is what he believes at this point in time.
3899200	3903200	And I suppose this could have been done with an eye on his place in the history books,
3903200	3907600	or to protect himself if there was any significant repercussions after the bombs,
3907600	3909440	then he could have pointed to this and claimed,
3909440	3913680	hey, I ordered them to be dropped on military targets, you can't pin this on me.
3913680	3917600	All these options are just speculation on my part, however.
3917600	3921920	If I was forced to guess, I'd say he was probably deceiving himself,
3921920	3925040	but I do not know the actual reason why Truman wrote
3925040	3928480	that the bombs were only going to be used on military targets.
3928480	3932640	I only know that for whatever reason. When he wrote that, he was wrong.
3933200	3936240	Now, leaving the nuclear bombs to the side for a moment,
3936240	3939040	I wouldn't blame someone for asking at this point.
3939040	3944880	If Truman and Burns are apparently so anxious to get the war over with before the Russians get involved,
3944880	3948480	and they knew at Potsdam that the Emperor was asking for peace,
3948480	3952560	why was peace not able to be negotiated sooner than it was?
3952560	3955200	Why, when they heard the Emperor wanted peace,
3955200	3960800	did they not simply send him a message saying, great, okay, let's negotiate peace?
3960800	3964960	And the answer to that is the deadlock over unconditional surrender.
3964960	3969760	As we know, Japan was committed to avoiding an unconditional surrender,
3969760	3973120	but Truman was likewise committed to securing one.
3973120	3977920	He didn't want to accept what the Japanese were offering, which was a negotiated peace.
3978480	3981520	He wanted a full unconditional surrender.
3981520	3985920	Now, various individuals within the Allied governments and armed forces
3985920	3990000	understood that insisting on absolute unconditional surrender was,
3990000	3993040	particularly with regards to the question of the Emperor,
3993040	3996640	going to cause problems and possibly prolong the war.
3996640	4001760	While at the Yalta Conference, Winston Churchill suggested that mitigating the terms of surrender,
4001760	4007120	quote, would be worthwhile if it led to the saving of a year or a year and a half of war
4007120	4010240	in which so much blood and treasure would be poured out.
4010240	4014960	But President Roosevelt was unreceptive to Churchill's suggestion.
4014960	4020000	Not to be deterred, however, Churchill tried again when talking to Truman at Potsdam,
4020000	4022640	and he later gave an account of the conversation.
4022640	4027840	I dwelt upon the tremendous cost in American life and to a smaller extent in British life,
4027840	4032240	which would be involved in forcing unconditional surrender upon the Japanese.
4032240	4036400	It was for him to consider whether this might not be expressed in some other way,
4036400	4039760	so that we got all the essentials for future peace and security,
4039760	4043360	and yet left the Japanese some show of saving their military honor
4043360	4046160	and some assurance of their national existence.
4046160	4050640	However, Churchill found this president as unreceptive as the last.
4050640	4054080	Truman, quote, countered by saying that he did not think the Japanese
4054080	4056800	had any military honor after Pearl Harbor.
4056880	4059440	But Churchill responded that, at any rate,
4059440	4064000	they had something for which they were ready to face certain death in very large numbers,
4064000	4067440	and this might not be so important to us as to them.
4067440	4072400	Others attempted to influence Truman on the unconditional surrender issue at various times,
4072400	4075760	sometimes seemingly having more luck than Churchill there.
4075760	4080400	Under Secretary of State Joseph Grew, who understood the importance of the emperor
4080400	4085760	having been US ambassador to Japan for a decade, advised Truman on the 28th of May
4085760	4089520	that the greatest obstacle to unconditional surrender by the Japanese
4089520	4092000	is their belief that this would entail the destruction
4092000	4095920	or permanent removal of the emperor and the institution of the throne.
4095920	4098320	And Grew goes on to say that without an assurance
4098320	4100800	that the imperial institution would not be destroyed,
4100800	4103920	a Japanese surrender would be highly unlikely.
4103920	4107840	And he further notes that the president said that he was interested in what I said
4107840	4111040	because his own thoughts had been following the same line.
4111040	4116000	Another of Truman's advisors who took a similar line was Secretary of War Henry Stimson,
4116000	4118080	who spoke to Truman on the 2nd of July
4118080	4121440	on the issue of drafting surrender terms for Japan, stating that
4121440	4124800	"...I personally think that if we should add that we do not exclude
4124800	4127920	a constitutional monarchy under her present dynasty,
4127920	4130960	it would substantially add to the chances of acceptance."
4130960	4134160	And Stimson later wrote in his diary that Truman was, quote,
4134160	4138880	"...apparently acquiescent with my attitude towards the treatment of Japan."
4138960	4141760	Now, I think there's two possibilities here.
4141760	4144400	The first is that President Harry S. Truman
4144400	4146880	was one of those intensely annoying people
4146880	4151200	who simply agree with whatever the last person they spoke to said to them,
4151200	4154560	showing absolutely no respect for future historians
4154560	4158000	attempting to figure out what they actually thought about anything.
4158000	4160800	The second is that Truman was actually sympathetic
4160800	4163120	to what his advisors were advising him
4163120	4165920	with regards to softening unconditional surrender,
4165920	4171040	but there was some other influence preventing him from acting on that advice.
4171040	4174960	And we perhaps see a hint of this at a meeting on the 18th of June,
4174960	4177520	when this time, Admiral Leahy tried his luck
4177520	4180320	at pushing for a softening of unconditional surrender,
4180320	4183440	stating that "...our insistence on unconditional surrender
4183440	4186320	would result only in making the Japanese desperate
4186320	4189280	and thereby increase our casualty lists."
4189280	4190880	And Truman responded that
4190880	4194080	"...he did not feel that he could take any action at this time
4194080	4196880	to change public opinion on the matter."
4196880	4198880	So, the opinion of the public
4198880	4201680	is being factored into the decision-making process
4201680	4204000	regarding Japanese surrender terms.
4204000	4206560	And I think it's fair to say that the United States public
4206560	4209360	were not the biggest fans of Emperor Hirohito.
4209360	4212480	A Gallup poll conducted on the 29th of June reported
4212480	4215840	that when asked what the fate of the Emperor should be after the war,
4215840	4217920	the most popular response was,
4217920	4219200	"...execute him."
4219200	4222240	So any US president with an eye on public opinion
4222240	4223920	is in a bit of a tricky position
4223920	4227520	when it comes to openly telling Japan they can keep their emperor,
4227520	4229760	especially if said US president
4229760	4233200	has a history of calling for unconditional surrender.
4233200	4236000	Just about the only person not advising Truman
4236000	4238720	to soften the surrender terms was James Burns,
4238720	4240960	who will later rather dramatically state
4240960	4244400	that Truman appearing to back down from unconditional surrender
4244400	4247760	would lead to the crucifixion of the president.
4247760	4251760	All of this is complicated by the fact that behind the scenes,
4251760	4253840	the leadership of the Allied military
4253840	4256640	did not desire to get rid of the Emperor.
4256640	4259520	In fact, there was actually a pressing military reason
4259520	4261040	to retain the Emperor.
4261040	4263600	And to quote a meeting of the Combined Chiefs of Staff
4263600	4265840	that took place on the 16th of July
4265840	4268000	when discussing unconditional surrender,
4268000	4269360	it was suggested that,
4269360	4272320	"...if, for instance, an interpretation could be found
4272320	4274160	and communicated to the Japanese
4274160	4278000	which did not involve the dissolution of the Imperial Institution,
4278000	4280960	the Emperor would be in a position to order the ceasefire
4280960	4282240	in outlying areas,
4282240	4284560	whereas if the dynasty were destroyed,
4284560	4287040	the outlying garrisons might continue to fight
4287040	4288960	for many months or years."
4288960	4292000	So the proposal here is to leave the Emperor in place
4292000	4293920	and use his influence to convince
4293920	4296800	the scattered Japanese troops to stand down,
4296800	4299440	whereas if they simply kill or imprison the Emperor,
4299440	4301760	that might prompt the troops to fight on.
4301760	4305040	So Truman's being pulled in different directions here.
4305040	4306800	Strictly militarily speaking,
4306800	4309520	letting Japan keep the Emperor makes a lot of sense.
4309520	4311760	It will almost certainly shorten the war,
4311760	4312560	save lives,
4312560	4315760	and be the thing to convince the Japanese military to give up.
4315760	4318800	Conveying that message to the Japanese leadership
4318800	4320400	prior to their surrender, though,
4320400	4324080	is potentially risky from a domestic political standpoint.
4324080	4327600	If you've previously been calling for unconditional surrender,
4327600	4330400	you don't want to be seen as reversing position on that
4330400	4333760	and giving in to a hated enemy's demands.
4333760	4337360	However, the threat of the Soviet Union's expansion into Asia
4337440	4340000	means you do want to end the war quickly.
4340000	4342480	So there's conflicting motivations here,
4342480	4345360	and these conflicting motivations came to influence
4345360	4348240	the construction of the Potsdam Declaration.
4348240	4352320	Now, this was a statement issued by the Allies on the 26th of July
4352320	4355440	that called for the unconditional surrender of Japan,
4355440	4356080	saying,
4356080	4358720	"...we call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now
4358720	4362080	the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces
4362080	4364960	and to provide proper and adequate assurances
4364960	4367360	of their good faith in such action."
4367360	4371360	The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction,
4371360	4373280	and it laid out various terms,
4373280	4376640	such as the occupation of Japanese territory by the Allies,
4376640	4379040	the disarming of the Japanese military,
4379040	4380000	and so on.
4380000	4381120	Notably, however,
4381120	4385280	the Potsdam Declaration did not contain any mention of the Emperor,
4385280	4387120	which you might think is rather odd,
4387120	4389680	given that the Allies clearly know how important
4389680	4393760	the question of the Imperial Institution was to the Japanese leadership.
4393760	4395280	However, it did state that
4395280	4398960	"...the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled
4398960	4402000	the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest
4402000	4404800	must be eliminated for all time."
4404800	4409040	And this is rather vague with respect to exactly who it means.
4409040	4413920	Does the Emperor count as one of those who have misled the people of Japan?
4413920	4416960	When the Japanese leadership received the Potsdam Declaration,
4416960	4421680	the hardliners on the Supreme Council interpreted this in a very unfavorable way
4421680	4425600	and took it to be an indirect threat to the Emperor's life.
4425600	4428240	Another confusing point for the Japanese leadership
4428240	4430800	was that when the Potsdam Declaration was issued,
4430800	4432960	it was signed by the United States,
4432960	4433760	Britain,
4433760	4434480	China,
4434480	4436400	and, interestingly,
4436400	4438480	not the Soviet Union.
4438480	4441520	To the Supreme Council, this inspired a question,
4441520	4443520	as well as a fair bit of false hope.
4444240	4447600	If the Soviet Union didn't sign this declaration,
4447600	4451280	does that mean that they possibly disagree with the declaration?
4451280	4453520	What is Russia's position here?
4453520	4457520	Since they didn't sign the document calling for our unconditional surrender,
4457520	4462160	does that mean they might be open to negotiating better terms for us after all?
4462160	4467120	After receiving the Potsdam Declaration, Togo met with the Emperor to discuss it.
4467120	4470320	The Emperor thought that the terms of the declaration were, quote,
4470320	4472480	"...acceptable in principle,"
4472480	4478240	but he agreed to postpone a response until after they had heard back from the Soviet Union.
4478240	4482640	So Togo sent a message to Ambassador Sato on the 28th of July
4482640	4489120	with instructions to attempt to sound out the Russian attitude towards the joint declaration.
4489120	4494320	Ambassador Sato, for his part, had had just about enough of this nonsense.
4494320	4498080	He had been repeatedly saying that the Russia plan was not going to work,
4498080	4502000	and yet here's another message from Tokyo postponing surrender
4502000	4505520	in order to ask what the situation is with the Russians.
4505520	4509120	Sato's messages in response were openly insubordinate
4509120	4512640	and strayed into brazenly telling Tokyo what to do.
4512640	4515760	Sato said, and I'm paraphrasing here,
4515760	4520320	"...look, if Stalin disagreed with the terms of the Potsdam Declaration,
4520320	4523360	he would have negotiated better terms at the time.
4523360	4526640	And if he wasn't able to negotiate better terms at the time,
4526640	4529440	he's not going to be able to do that now, is he?
4529440	4532560	The Soviet Union is not going to help you.
4532560	4537600	In fact, if you don't immediately surrender, they are probably going to declare war on you."
4537600	4544400	The Supreme Council, on receiving these messages, finally saw sense and decided to end the war.
4545360	4548320	No, I'm joking, Sato was ignored, obviously.
4548320	4553040	So the Potsdam Declaration contained no direct information about the fate of the Emperor,
4553040	4556400	and it left open the question of the Soviet Union's position,
4556400	4561520	which prompted the Japanese leadership to postpone a response until they knew what that was.
4561520	4565520	Until then, their official position was to ignore the declaration.
4565520	4571040	So if the Potsdam Declaration was intended to produce a surrender from Japan, it failed.
4571040	4574240	However, when the Potsdam Declaration was first drafted
4574240	4579440	by the Office of Secretary of War Henry Stimson, it included the following point.
4579440	4583520	"...the occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan
4583520	4587840	as soon as our objectives are accomplished and there has been established beyond doubt
4587840	4594000	a peacefully inclined responsible government of a character representative of the Japanese people.
4594000	4599120	This may include a constitutional monarchy under the present dynasty."
4599120	4603840	So that is a concrete offer to retain the imperial institution right there.
4603840	4609120	And earlier drafts of the Potsdam Declaration also included among the signatories
4609120	4611840	the generalissimo of the Soviet Union.
4612400	4614960	So, what happened here then?
4614960	4619760	Well, between the first draft leaving Stimson's office and it being issued publicly,
4619760	4622880	the Potsdam Declaration went through various drafts.
4622880	4629040	Most importantly for us here, the document was edited by President Truman and James Burns.
4629040	4634400	The final draft, of course, saw the Soviet Union being removed from the list of signatories
4634400	4638000	and the offer to retain the imperial institution deleted.
4638000	4642480	Firstly, on the issue of the Soviet Union being removed from the declaration,
4642480	4645360	President Truman simply writes in his memoirs that
4645360	4649200	"...Stalin could not, of course, be a party to the proclamation itself
4649200	4651760	since he was still at peace with Japan."
4651760	4657200	So that's Truman's stated reason for excluding the Soviet Union from the declaration.
4657200	4659760	The Soviet Union is not yet in the war
4659760	4662960	and technically still has a non-aggression pact in place with Japan.
4663520	4666960	But why, we might ask, does this mean that the Soviet Union
4666960	4670480	can't sign a document calling for Japan to surrender?
4670480	4673840	I mean, Truman's stated intent for going to Potsdam
4673840	4677680	was to convince the Russians to violate that non-aggression pact
4677680	4681200	and have their military attack the Japanese military.
4681200	4686080	So I'm going to go ahead and assume that respect for the sanctity of non-aggression pacts
4686080	4687920	is clearly not the reason here.
4687920	4692720	And if Truman is implying that he was worried that the Soviet Union signing the document
4692720	4695120	would lead to war between Russia and Japan,
4695120	4698480	well, that's what he's supposed to want to happen.
4698480	4702800	In fact, the Soviet Union's exclusion from the final draft of the document
4702800	4707040	came as an enormous surprise to the delegation from the Soviet Union,
4707040	4709840	who had written their own draft of the Potsdam Declaration,
4709840	4713120	which included themselves as signatories.
4713120	4716720	So they clearly wanted in on the signing of the document.
4716720	4721360	Instead, the Soviet delegation was not consulted about the drafting of the declaration
4721360	4724160	and were only told it was being released to the press
4724160	4727280	at the same time it was being released to the press.
4727280	4730080	Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Molotov
4730080	4734000	submitted a request to delay the publication of the declaration,
4734000	4737360	but James Burns claimed he didn't get the message in time.
4737920	4738420	Hmm.
4738960	4743920	As for why the Soviet Union wanted to be included among the list of signatories,
4743920	4746320	Stalin and Molotov wanted a pretext
4746320	4750400	to abandon their non-aggression pact with Japan and invade Manchuria.
4750400	4755680	And the Potsdam Declaration's ultimatum to Japan would have provided that pretext.
4755680	4760480	So, after being edited out of the declaration, they tried a more direct approach.
4760480	4762720	In a meeting on the 29th of July,
4762720	4766400	Molotov submitted a request from Stalin for the United States,
4766400	4768320	England, and the other Allies, quote,
4768320	4774000	to address a formal request to the Soviet government for its entry into the war.
4774000	4777520	Now, this put Truman and Burns in a very awkward position,
4777520	4782320	because, of course, they're supposed to want the Soviet government to enter the war,
4782320	4784560	but they clearly don't anymore.
4784560	4786880	As Burns later wrote in his memoirs,
4786880	4790640	"...we had, of course, begun to hope a Japanese surrender might be imminent,
4790640	4794400	and we did not want to urge the Russians to enter the war."
4794400	4797600	Truman and Burns figure they just have to wait a week or so
4797600	4799680	for the first nuclear bomb to be dropped,
4799680	4805680	and then Japan will surrender before the Soviet Union has a chance to declare war and invade.
4805680	4810400	So being asked directly for an invitation to the war put Truman on the spot,
4810400	4812560	and he sidestepped the issue.
4812560	4815520	The Soviets will get no invitation from him.
4816080	4818160	However, an interesting note here is that
4818160	4821360	when the Soviet Union does actually declare war on Japan,
4821360	4825440	they say they have acceded to the Allied request to join the war.
4825440	4829840	So they didn't get an invitation, but they just acted like they did anyway.
4829840	4833680	Now, of course, excluding the Soviets from the Potsdam Declaration
4833680	4836640	and dodging their request for an invitation to join the war
4836640	4840800	confirmed to Stalin that Truman was planning to finish the war without him.
4840800	4846560	So while at Potsdam, Stalin ordered his generals to speed up their invasion plans.
4846560	4849520	He wasn't going to be left out of the kill.
4849520	4854800	So I think it's fairly clear why the Soviet Union was excluded from the Potsdam Declaration.
4854800	4858400	Burns and Truman are planning to finish the war without Stalin,
4858400	4862880	and that includes not having Stalin's signature on the surrender papers.
4862880	4869440	So when Japan surrenders, it will not be, in any way, a surrender to the Soviet Union, is the plan.
4869440	4872080	The second important added to the Potsdam Declaration
4872080	4875520	was the removal of the offer to retain the Imperial Institution.
4875520	4880640	And the reasoning for this change is found in the diary of Henry Stimson, who writes that,
4880640	4884800	"...when the Potsdam conditions were drawn and left my office where they originated,
4884800	4889840	they contained a provision which permitted the continuance of the dynasty with certain conditions.
4889840	4893120	The President and Burns struck that out.
4893120	4896080	They were not obdurate on it, but they thought they could arrange it
4896080	4901280	in the necessary secret negotiations which would take place after any armistice."
4901280	4905920	So Truman and Burns think the position of the Emperor is a matter to be negotiated
4905920	4908560	after Japan has already surrendered.
4908560	4911280	And they're both convinced that the nuclear bomb
4911280	4914880	is definitely about to force an unconditional surrender from Japan.
4914880	4916560	Remember that Truman is, quote,
4916560	4921600	"...sure that Japan will surrender when Manhattan appears over their homeland."
4921600	4925440	So given that, why should they make any concessions beforehand
4925440	4927680	and risk an unnecessary backlash?
4927680	4931760	Truman and Burns plan to use the bomb to make Japan surrender unconditionally
4931760	4934560	before Russia joins the war, and anything else,
4934560	4938880	like the position of the Emperor, can simply be sorted out afterwards.
4938880	4942400	So here's the situation we're in at the end of the Potsdam Conference.
4942400	4946880	The Japanese leadership is still refusing to accept an unconditional surrender,
4946880	4949680	but Truman is refusing to accept anything less,
4949680	4952880	even though on the principle point, the fate of the Emperor,
4952880	4954320	both sides are in agreement.
4954320	4956320	They don't want to get rid of the Emperor.
4956320	4960560	But since neither side wanted to blink first, the deadlock remained.
4960560	4964480	Japan waited for rescue from the Soviet Union that would never come,
4964480	4967760	and the United States moved forward with the atomic bombings.
4968320	4972480	The first atomic bomb was dropped in the center of Hiroshima on August 6th
4972480	4974720	at about 8.15 in the morning.
4974720	4979360	It exploded directly above a hospital, immediately killing everyone inside.
4980000	4985360	Within the immediate blast radius were the Honkawa and Fukuromachi Elementary Schools,
4985360	4989840	which were completely destroyed, instantly incinerating hundreds of schoolchildren.
4990400	4994000	This is the purely military target right here.
4994000	4997440	Now my video is about the reasons why these bombs were dropped,
4997440	5000000	not the actual explosions themselves.
5000000	5005280	There are many sources for first-hand accounts of the terrifying effects of the atomic bomb,
5005280	5008800	and you can look those up yourself if you're in a particularly good mood today
5008800	5010160	and would like to ruin it.
5010160	5013200	I'll just say here that tens of thousands of civilians,
5013200	5015280	including thousands of schoolchildren,
5015280	5018080	were killed, permanently injured, and disfigured
5018080	5020720	in a number of cruel and horrible ways.
5020720	5023360	Many of those not killed by the initial blast
5023360	5026080	also suffered the effects of radiation poisoning,
5026080	5029040	which killed and made seriously sick many more people.
5029040	5031280	Altogether, between the two atomic bombs,
5031280	5037440	it's estimated that between 129,000 and 226,000 people were killed,
5037440	5040560	and the vast majority of these were innocent civilians.
5040560	5043200	This is particularly true in the case of Nagasaki,
5043200	5047200	where it is estimated that of the tens of thousands of people who were killed,
5047200	5050160	only 150 of them were soldiers.
5050160	5055440	When the leadership of Japan got news of the Hiroshima bomb, they discussed what to do.
5055440	5059520	Foreign Minister Togo saw in the bomb a chance to end the war,
5059520	5062240	and he argued at a meeting on the 7th of August
5062240	5066480	that Japan should now accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.
5066560	5067760	He was ignored.
5067760	5070720	The militarists on the council were too far gone at this point
5070720	5073920	to be shaken by the destruction of just one more city.
5073920	5076560	War Minister Anami, after hearing the news,
5076560	5081280	said, "...I am convinced that the Americans had only one bomb after all."
5081280	5083600	Even after the destruction of Hiroshima,
5083600	5089040	Anami and the other militarists remained committed to pursuing a negotiated peace.
5089040	5092480	Togo met with the Emperor the next day, on August 8th,
5092480	5096080	and they both agreed that the war was lost and they should surrender.
5096080	5100000	But even these two, who have both wanted peace for a long time now,
5100000	5105120	are still thinking at this point about the possibility of negotiating a peace.
5105120	5109360	Togo stated after the war that while he and the Emperor wanted to end the war,
5109360	5111680	quote, "...as soon as possible,"
5111680	5117040	they would not completely discard the possibility of negotiating conditions.
5117040	5120160	Armed with the Emperor's wish that the war should be ended,
5120160	5123680	Togo called a meeting of the Supreme Council for the direction of the war
5123680	5128480	to be held the next day, as some ministers were unavailable.
5128480	5132320	And I'd like to comment on two incredibly frustrating things here.
5132320	5136400	First is obviously that the Japanese leadership did not unanimously
5136400	5139040	and immediately unconditionally surrender.
5139040	5142080	The militarists were still conning themselves into thinking
5142080	5146640	they would get to force favorable terms by fighting against an Allied invasion.
5146640	5152960	The second incredibly frustrating thing is just how amazingly slowly this process is going.
5152960	5155360	Hiroshima was bombed on August 6th.
5155360	5158800	Togo's advice to surrender was ignored on August 7th.
5158800	5162400	He met with the Emperor to discuss what to do on August 8th,
5162400	5167600	and then called the Supreme Council meeting to discuss things further on August 9th,
5167600	5170640	because some ministers weren't available sooner.
5171440	5173040	What were they doing?
5173040	5176080	They had something more important to do, clearly.
5176080	5177280	Where were they?
5177280	5179440	If Truman and Burns had intended the bomb
5179440	5182640	to immediately shock the Japanese leadership out of the war,
5182640	5184880	they severely miscalculated.
5184880	5189200	The militarists heard of the destruction of Hiroshima, and they shrugged.
5189200	5191440	It was just one more bombed city.
5191440	5193760	They'd seen dozens of those already.
5193760	5199840	The Emperor and the less unwise members of the council desired peace as they had before,
5199840	5203920	but despite claims they wanted to end the war as quickly as possible,
5203920	5206160	they too were moving in slow motion.
5206160	5209680	There is an arrogant lack of urgency here.
5209680	5212640	The Emperor isn't ordering an end to the war here.
5212640	5218080	He's simply letting it be known, again, that he thinks ending the war is desirable,
5218080	5221440	and asking Togo to pass the message on to the Supreme Council
5221440	5225120	once they get back off their holidays or wherever it was they went.
5225120	5228800	More than a full day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima,
5228800	5232880	Ambassador Sato in Moscow received the following message from Tokyo.
5232880	5235600	The situation is becoming more and more pressing,
5235600	5239360	and we would like to know at once the explicit attitude of the Russians.
5239680	5244640	So will you put forth still greater efforts to get a reply from them in haste?
5244640	5248640	Upon reading this, I picture Sato justifiably imagining himself
5248640	5252800	doing various types of violence to the members of the Supreme Council.
5252800	5257360	Sato wouldn't have to wait long to find out, as though he needed to,
5257360	5259840	the explicit attitude of the Russians.
5260400	5263440	Molotov summoned Sato to the Kremlin on August 8th
5263440	5268160	and handed him the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan,
5268160	5271520	and you rarely have to feel for the poor bastard at this point.
5271520	5275120	He warned them this was coming, and they didn't listen.
5275120	5278880	The Soviet army crossed the border into Japanese-occupied Manchuria
5278880	5283600	near midnight on the 8th of August and began smashing apart the Japanese defenses.
5283600	5289440	Because their leadership had refused to accept the inevitable reality of an imminent Russian invasion,
5289440	5294160	the underequipped Japanese troops were not prepared for or expecting a fight,
5294160	5295920	and they were quickly overwhelmed.
5295920	5299200	When the news of the Soviet declaration of war reached Tokyo,
5299200	5303120	Prime Minister Suzuki met with Cabinet Secretary Sakomizu,
5303120	5307440	and after discussing the news, came to the conclusion that their only two options
5307440	5312000	were either to declare war on the Soviet Union and fight to certain death,
5312000	5315360	or they could accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.
5315360	5319120	Suzuki met with the Emperor early in the morning on the 9th of August,
5319120	5323920	and the Emperor agreed to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration,
5323920	5327120	a meeting of the Supreme Council, was called.
5327120	5330800	The six members of the council met to discuss their upcoming surrender
5330800	5333920	and immediately deadlocked again.
5333920	5336480	I sound like a broken record here, I know,
5336480	5340080	but the moderate faction supported accepting the Potsdam Declaration
5340080	5343680	with the singular condition that the Imperial Institution be protected,
5343680	5348160	and the militarist faction supported accepting it only if they got to keep the Emperor,
5348160	5350000	do their own war crimes trials,
5350000	5352080	remain free of foreign occupation,
5352080	5353680	everyone gets a pony,
5353680	5357360	the army gets Fridays off now, etc.
5357360	5359840	Hours into this ridiculous conversation,
5359840	5364720	a messenger arrives to announce that Nagasaki had just been hit with a nuclear bomb.
5364720	5369040	Now, if anyone expects this news to have any impact whatsoever
5369040	5371280	upon the impasse in the Supreme Council,
5371280	5375280	I have done a very poor job of explaining what the Supreme Council is like.
5375280	5379760	The bombing of Nagasaki, of course, had no effect whatsoever.
5379760	5381760	The council remained deadlocked.
5381840	5383280	They spoke for hours.
5383280	5387520	They upgraded to a full government cabinet meeting with 16 members.
5387520	5390080	They spoke for hours again in that meeting.
5390080	5393600	No conclusion was reached, and they broke for dinner.
5393600	5398800	Now, I wouldn't blame anyone for considering this a very unlikely sequence of events.
5398800	5401280	How could they be hit with two nuclear bombs
5401280	5404000	and that still not be enough to break this deadlock?
5404000	5407840	And the answer to that is they, the Supreme Council,
5407840	5410720	haven't been hit with any nuclear bombs.
5410800	5414640	Some unimportant peasants somewhere have been hit with nuclear bombs.
5414640	5417600	The council are fine. They don't care.
5417600	5420880	This brings us back to one of the failures of morale bombing.
5420880	5426080	Totalitarian, militaristic regimes don't give a toss about their citizens.
5426080	5429120	You can't frighten them by killing poor people.
5429120	5430800	That's their day job.
5430800	5434320	At one or other of these council meetings prior to the end of the war,
5434320	5439600	Chief of the Army General Staff Umezu was asked about Japan's defense against atomic bombs,
5439600	5440560	and he replied,
5456560	5460800	So that's the militarist position on the bombs stated pretty clearly there.
5460800	5462160	They don't really care.
5462160	5465520	The nuclear bombs were no reason to surrender.
5465520	5469680	This impasse in the council did need to be broken somehow, though.
5469680	5474080	So Suzuki, Togo, and Sakomizu met in the Prime Minister's office
5474080	5478000	and hatched a plan to have the Emperor himself resolve the argument
5478000	5482480	with a sacred royal judgment, something which was highly unusual.
5482480	5487200	The Emperor was not supposed to get involved in affairs of state so directly.
5487200	5490560	To achieve this, they had to call an imperial conference.
5490560	5494240	So Suzuki went to the Emperor to request that one be called,
5494320	5499040	a request which was granted immediately, which is very shocking for this lot.
5499040	5502000	I'm surprised they didn't take a week off to think about it.
5502000	5505680	At this imperial conference, the members of the Supreme Council
5505680	5509840	immediately deadlocked along the same lines as all the previous meetings.
5509840	5511920	Their arguments were the same as before.
5511920	5515280	The militarists wanted to insist on attaching multiple conditions
5515280	5517600	to their offer to accept the Potsdam Declaration,
5517600	5522160	and the moderates wanted to attach only one, the preservation of the Emperor.
5522160	5526240	They talked until past 2 a.m. in the morning when Prime Minister Suzuki,
5526240	5529280	talking over the protests of War Minister Onami,
5529280	5533520	dared to ask the Emperor directly what he wanted to do.
5533520	5538080	The Emperor said he agreed with the moderates, and this intervention did the trick.
5538080	5541440	Japan would offer to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration,
5542160	5546160	with the understanding that said declaration does not comprise any demand
5546160	5550800	which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler.
5550800	5554720	Truman and his advisors got the message that morning on the 10th of August,
5554720	5557360	and they gathered to discuss their response.
5557360	5560560	Admiral Leahy thought that the condition should be accepted.
5560560	5564240	He argued that the matter of the Emperor's position was a trivial one
5564240	5568240	compared to passing up an opportunity to bring an end to the war.
5568240	5572400	Secretary Stimson likewise thought the condition should be accepted,
5572400	5574480	and he also notes in his diary,
5574480	5577520	"...in my opinion, with a slightly sarcastic tone,
5577520	5582640	it is curious that this was the very single point that I figured would make trouble."
5582640	5586160	And then he talks about his earlier draft of the Potsdam Declaration,
5586160	5589600	which included an offer to retain the Imperial Institution,
5589600	5593200	the very thing that was now delaying the end of the war.
5593200	5595200	If Stimson managed not to say,
5595200	5596560	"...I told you so,"
5596560	5599120	then he's a more disciplined man than I.
5599120	5601600	In support of accepting the Japanese condition,
5601600	5606240	Stimson argued that the United States wanted to keep the Emperor anyway.
5606240	5610640	They needed to use his power to convince the Japanese military to stand down.
5610640	5614000	Stimson was also aware that time was a factor here.
5614000	5616000	The Soviet Army was on the march,
5616000	5619520	and he thought that the war with Japan needed to be ended quickly
5619520	5623200	before the Russians were able to reach the Japanese homeland.
5623200	5625760	James Burns, on the other hand, said,
5625760	5628560	"...no, we should not accept this condition.
5628560	5633680	I do not see why we should retreat from our demand for unconditional surrender," he said.
5633680	5635760	"...If any conditions are to be accepted,
5635760	5640080	I want the United States and not Japan to state the conditions."
5640080	5643280	That was his account of his words from his memoirs there.
5643280	5647840	So the conditions, to the unconditional surrender, work that out,
5647840	5649680	should be coming from us here.
5649680	5653760	They lost the war, why do they get to say the conditions?
5653760	5656320	We won, we say the conditions.
5656320	5660320	A justification for Burns' position is found in Stimson's diary,
5660320	5661440	where he writes that,
5661440	5665360	"...Burns was troubled and anxious to find out whether we could accept this
5665360	5669520	in light of some of the public statements by Roosevelt and Truman.
5669520	5671840	Of course, during three years of a bitter war,
5671840	5674800	there have been bitter statements made about the Emperor.
5674800	5676880	Now they come to plague us."
5676880	5680000	So according to Stimson, Burns is again worried here
5680000	5684400	about the public perception of backing away from unconditional surrender.
5684400	5688880	We've been calling the Emperor a monstrous dictator for the last three years,
5688880	5692880	and now we're gonna let him off the hook because he told us to?
5692880	5694400	That's not gonna play.
5694400	5698000	So Truman and his advisors came up with a compromise position.
5698000	5701120	They would send a note to Japan, written by Burns,
5701120	5704960	intending to imply, without stating it so directly,
5704960	5707840	that Japan would be allowed to keep the Emperor.
5707840	5709280	The note stated that,
5709280	5713440	"...the Emperor shall issue his commands to all the Japanese military,
5713440	5715360	naval, and air authorities,
5715360	5718880	and to all the forces under their control wherever located,
5718880	5722640	to cease active operations and to surrender their arms,
5722640	5727200	and to issue such other orders as the Supreme Commander may require
5727200	5729520	to give effect to the surrender terms."
5729520	5732960	So they're giving the Emperor a list of jobs, basically.
5732960	5735600	They're implying that he gets to stay around
5735600	5738880	by laying out what his role is going to be going forward.
5739520	5741040	And the note also states that,
5741040	5743840	"...the ultimate form of government of Japan shall,
5743840	5746160	in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration,
5746160	5750720	be established by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people."
5750720	5755280	Truman sums up the intended aim of the Burns note in his diary when he says,
5755280	5758560	"...they wanted to make a condition precedent to the surrender.
5758560	5760800	They wanted to keep the Emperor.
5760800	5765360	We told him we'd tell him how to keep him, but we'd make the terms."
5765360	5768560	So what's happened here is the United States said to Japan,
5768560	5770960	"...we demand you surrender unconditionally."
5770960	5772160	And Japan responded,
5772160	5775040	"...we will gladly accept unconditional surrender
5775040	5779920	on the condition that you first agree to this condition to that unconditional surrender."
5779920	5781840	To which the United States responded,
5781840	5785440	"...oh, we will happily agree to this condition to the unconditional surrender
5785440	5788960	on the condition that you agree that you're accepting the condition,
5788960	5791120	not that we are accepting the condition.
5791120	5795760	You're keeping the Emperor because we want that, not because you want that.
5795760	5796880	So there."
5796880	5799920	When the Japanese leadership received the Burns note,
5799920	5803040	well, we all know how this goes by now, don't we?
5803040	5805360	There was yet another stalemate.
5805360	5807760	They disagreed over its exact meaning.
5807760	5813920	There were arguments, plots, threats, proposed possible revisions to the note.
5813920	5818480	Prime Minister Suzuki swapped sides for a bit and then swapped back again.
5818480	5820160	None of this matters at all.
5820160	5823520	They're just wasting time not accomplishing anything.
5823520	5825760	After several days of this nonsense,
5825840	5829920	the Emperor intervened to break the stalemate... again.
5829920	5834240	On August 14th, the Emperor summoned his cabinet to an Imperial conference,
5834240	5838000	listened once more to the tedious arguments of the militarists,
5838000	5843040	and responded that he had not changed his mind and still wanted to end the war.
5843040	5849440	This second direct intervention finally mercifully brought about a surrender.
5849440	5853040	Japan would accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.
5853040	5855440	At 12 midday on August 15th,
5855440	5861200	the Emperor broadcast by public radio an address announcing that the war was over.
5861200	5865360	Now around this time, there was a coup attempt organized by some junior officers
5865360	5869040	in the Japanese military trying to prevent Japan's surrender,
5869040	5873760	but they failed to gain support of the military leadership and it quickly fizzled out.
5873760	5876800	War Minister Anami refused to support the coup,
5876800	5880160	choosing instead to go home and commit suicide.
5880160	5882880	And though the war with the other allies was over,
5882880	5888960	Stalin stepped up his offensive against the Japanese-occupied territories he wished to capture.
5888960	5893920	Surrender or no surrender, Stalin was going to take what he felt he was owed.
5893920	5897600	And Russia's annexing, for instance, of several of the Kuril Islands
5897600	5901040	led to a dispute over ownership that is still going on today,
5901040	5905680	with both Japan and Russia arguing over who has sovereignty of the islands,
5905680	5908080	when, really, it should be neither of them.
5908160	5912640	There were already people on those islands before either Russia or Japan turned up.
5912640	5915840	Other than that though, the Second World War was over.
5916560	5917200	Just about.
5917840	5921600	Now, with regards to our main topic today, we can ask a question.
5921600	5926320	What effect did the nuclear bombs have on Japan's decision to end the war?
5926320	5931920	Well, Japan needed three main things, I would argue, in order to end the war.
5931920	5937280	Firstly, they had to be in a hopeless military situation with no chance of winning the war
5937360	5938960	and be aware of that.
5938960	5940240	And this one we can tick off.
5940240	5945760	The Japanese leadership knew it had no chance to actually defeat the allies militarily.
5945760	5948000	They had known that for quite a while.
5948000	5951440	Their only hope for their military was to use whatever was left of it
5951440	5955520	to drag out the war with the hopes of securing better peace terms for themselves.
5956160	5961440	Secondly, Japan had to be in a hopeless diplomatic situation and be aware of that.
5962000	5968000	Now, ever since the Russians signed the secret pact to declare war on Japan at the Yalta Conference,
5968000	5971920	the Japanese government was in a hopeless diplomatic situation.
5971920	5975520	But for a long time, they didn't understand that they were.
5975520	5980960	They held out hope for Russian mediation all the way until the Soviet Union declared war on them.
5981520	5985360	Now, some of the actions of the Allies undoubtedly contributed to Japan
5985360	5987840	not understanding the position they were in,
5987840	5991600	principal among those probably being the Soviet Union's signature
5991600	5994080	being struck off the Potsdam Declaration.
5994080	5999280	But we also can't ignore the capacity for willful ignorance and self-deception
5999280	6001600	among the members of the Japanese leadership.
6002160	6005840	They should have known their situation was hopeless.
6005840	6009200	After the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, however,
6009200	6013280	the Japanese leadership finally understood this second point.
6013280	6015760	And I'd like to add something here.
6015760	6020240	The strategic bombing survey that I mentioned at the start of the video stated,
6020240	6024160	Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped,
6024160	6026320	even if Russia had not entered the war,
6026320	6030080	and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.
6030080	6034320	Now, I don't actually agree with that on the Russia point, anyway.
6034320	6037120	I personally feel that if the Japanese leadership,
6037120	6040000	with regards to getting help from the Soviet Union,
6040000	6042640	thought there was any hope remaining whatsoever,
6042640	6044800	they probably never would have surrendered,
6044800	6048480	even if it meant their entire country was burned to the ground.
6048480	6051760	The Soviet Union declaring war on Japan was crucial,
6051760	6055840	in that it forced them to confront their hopeless diplomatic situation.
6055840	6059440	To return to our list of things Japan needed in order to end the war,
6059440	6064480	third is an assurance that the Imperial Institution would not be abolished.
6064480	6067360	This was the main problem the Japanese leadership had
6067360	6071360	with the Allied demand for unconditional surrender, of course.
6071360	6076640	And I'd argue that the question of the Emperor was the most important point on this list.
6076640	6078640	And that's both on a national level,
6078640	6082560	the Emperor being a very important figure in Japanese society,
6082560	6084720	but also on a personal level,
6084720	6088720	because it's the Emperor himself intervening to end the war.
6088720	6094240	So an assurance that the Emperor himself would not be executed as a result of doing that
6094240	6097040	would probably help to speed things along there.
6097040	6100480	People who defend the atomic bombings as being necessary
6100480	6104320	often point to the bluster of the Japanese militarists who were,
6104320	6107600	even after the bombings and the Russian declaration of war,
6107600	6109760	still promising to fight to the last,
6109760	6114000	with the desperate idea of somehow securing better terms for themselves.
6114000	6117760	But they didn't do that once the Emperor intervened.
6117760	6122080	And the Emperor intervened not to avoid more cities being destroyed.
6122080	6125360	Remember, dozens of cities had already been destroyed.
6125360	6129440	The Emperor intervened to protect the Imperial office.
6129520	6131200	In a post-war interview,
6131200	6136240	he explained one of his reasons for choosing to intervene as being that, quote,
6136240	6138720	"...if the enemy landed near Ise Bay,
6138720	6142960	both Ise and Atsuta shrines would immediately come under their control.
6142960	6147840	There would be no time to transfer the sacred regalia of the Imperial family,
6147840	6150000	and no hope of protecting them."
6150000	6152960	Now, you'd think that protecting the Imperial knick-knacks
6152960	6157840	would be an unmentionably minor concern when compared to the nuclear bombing raids,
6157840	6159120	but apparently not.
6159120	6162960	The Emperor took all this Emperor business very seriously,
6162960	6165600	as did the rest of the Japanese government.
6165600	6170000	The militarists on the Supreme Council might have wanted to hold out for better terms,
6170000	6172480	even if it meant fighting to the death,
6172480	6176800	but they were not prepared to contradict the will of the Emperor.
6176800	6181520	Admiral Leahy wrote in his memoirs that himself and Secretary Stimson,
6181520	6184080	in their combined staff meetings, were, quote,
6184080	6185840	"...certain that the Mikado..."
6185840	6188160	That's an antiquated term for the Emperor.
6188800	6191680	"...could stop the war with a royal word."
6191680	6193920	And this turned out to be accurate.
6193920	6197360	That is how the war was stopped on the Japanese end.
6197360	6203040	Now, I don't want to get too deep into speculation about alternate history timelines today,
6203040	6207200	but I think it's fairly obvious that President Truman and James Burns,
6207200	6211920	deleting the offer to retain the Imperial institution from the Potsdam Declaration,
6211920	6214400	almost certainly lengthened the war.
6214400	6218400	If the Emperor didn't intervene to bring about a surrender immediately
6218400	6221280	upon receiving peace terms that assured his position,
6221280	6223280	he almost certainly would have,
6223280	6226720	when that was coupled with a Soviet declaration of war.
6226720	6229840	Japan had only been holding out for Russian mediation
6229840	6232720	in the hopes of securing better peace terms.
6232720	6237680	After the Soviet declaration of war, that option was fully off the table.
6237680	6240400	So I'd say it's vastly more likely than not
6240400	6244720	that having in hand both a declaration of war from the Soviet Union
6244720	6249680	and surrender terms from the other Allies that assured the Imperial House would survive,
6249680	6252160	the Emperor would have ended the war right there,
6252160	6256240	regardless of whether Japan had been hit with nuclear bombs or not.
6256240	6259280	Henry Stimson later noted in his memoirs that,
6259280	6262160	"...it is possible, in light of the final surrender,
6262160	6267440	that a clearer and earlier exposition of American willingness to retain the Emperor
6267440	6270720	would have produced an earlier ending to the war."
6270720	6273760	And he concluded in 1948 that,
6273760	6276640	"...history might find that the United States,
6276640	6281360	by its delay in stating its position, had prolonged the war."
6281360	6284560	Now, it would be very simple to conclude at this point that,
6284560	6286480	with regards to the end of the war,
6286480	6289120	the question of the Emperor was everything,
6289120	6292080	and the nuclear bombs didn't do anything.
6292080	6294400	But is that really the case?
6294400	6296480	Let's pose a few questions.
6296480	6297920	Firstly, we can ask,
6297920	6301360	were the bombs necessary to defeat Japan militarily?
6301360	6304160	And the answer to that is obviously no.
6304160	6306320	The Japanese leadership were beaten,
6306320	6309760	and they knew they were beaten long before the bombs were dropped.
6309760	6312640	So, were the bombs necessary to defeat Japan
6312640	6318080	without needing to carry out a ground invasion of the four main Japanese islands?
6318080	6322160	Well, to start with, we've quoted multiple US military leaders today
6322160	6324480	who say that Japan was ready to surrender
6324480	6328080	without either an invasion or the bombs being necessary.
6328080	6331520	But can we really trust their judgment of the situation?
6331520	6334640	You see, those leaders had a couple of potential reasons
6334640	6337600	to downplay the effectiveness of the bomb.
6337600	6339360	The first of these is simply that
6339360	6342560	they didn't want to be put out of a job by this thing.
6342560	6343840	The worry there was that,
6343840	6346560	if the atomic bombs really are that effective,
6346560	6350880	then maybe we don't need such a large conventional military force anymore.
6350880	6353040	So, clear your desk.
6353040	6355920	And another reason, I imagine, was pride.
6355920	6358720	If it's you who's been fighting the war all this time,
6358720	6362720	backing Japan into a corner and bringing them to the verge of surrender,
6362720	6365440	you probably don't want the narrative afterwards to be
6365440	6369920	scientists save the day and end the war with their new bomb.
6369920	6373360	It kind of undercuts all the work you did prior to that.
6373360	6377040	So I can see the motive there for US military leaders at the time to say,
6377120	6387280	However, these ulterior motives do not mean that the military leaders
6387280	6391840	who spoke out against the bomb were necessarily lying or wrong.
6391840	6393920	We know from what we've talked about today
6393920	6397120	that the Japanese leadership was close to surrender,
6397120	6400240	and was, as President Truman wrote in his diary,
6400240	6401760	asking for peace.
6401760	6405360	Japan would have surrendered long before an invasion if,
6405360	6409760	for instance, they thought they could secure terms which were acceptable to them.
6409760	6413120	They didn't actually want to be invaded just for the sake of it,
6413120	6418000	they were holding out for an invasion in the hopes of avoiding an unconditional surrender.
6418000	6423120	So US military leaders who claimed the bombs were not necessary to end the war were correct,
6423120	6426400	even if they had an ulterior motive for saying so.
6426400	6428320	Instead of a motivation to lie,
6428320	6432720	they could just have easily have had a motivation to tell an uncomfortable truth.
6433280	6436400	So then, were the bombs necessary to force Japan
6436400	6440800	to offer to surrender on the Allied terms without any conditions?
6440800	6444960	And the answer to this is also no, because they didn't do that.
6445520	6447120	Even after two atomic bombs,
6447120	6451120	the Japanese leadership still only offered to surrender on the condition
6451120	6453840	that they were assured they could keep the Emperor.
6453840	6458400	And between that offer to surrender and their eventual actual surrender,
6458400	6461440	they didn't get hit with any more nuclear bombs.
6461440	6464720	All this being said, I do not think that the nuclear bombs
6464720	6468880	had absolutely no effect at all on Japan's decision to surrender.
6468880	6472800	It would be going much too far to make that claim, in my opinion.
6472800	6477440	I'd say there were two main effects that the bombs had upon the end of the war.
6477440	6482160	Firstly, the nuclear bomb probably indirectly shortened the war,
6482160	6487200	because its existence prompted Truman to try to finish the war without the Soviet Union,
6487200	6491760	which in turn prompted Stalin to speed up his plans to declare war on Japan,
6491760	6496400	and that declaration of war sped up the Emperor intervening in the Supreme Council
6496400	6500640	to bring about an offer to surrender, with their condition, of course.
6500640	6504480	The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on the 8th of August,
6504480	6508640	and it's likely that if they weren't racing to get in the war as quickly as possible,
6508640	6511600	they would have declared war later in August sometime,
6511600	6515440	the 15th is what Stalin told Truman at Potsdam.
6515520	6518640	So we can say that, all other things being equal,
6518640	6523520	the existence of the atomic bomb probably shortened the war by a week or so.
6523520	6528480	The other effect the nuclear bomb had on the end of the war is a rather interesting one.
6528480	6534160	And let's read a post-war quote from Cabinet Secretary Sakomizu talking about the bomb.
6534160	6536560	"...the chance had come to end the war.
6536560	6542400	It was not necessary to blame the military side, the manufacturing people, or anyone else,
6542400	6544320	just the atomic bomb.
6544320	6546320	It was a good excuse.
6546320	6550800	Someone said the atomic bomb was the kamikaze to save Japan."
6550800	6556800	So, the bomb provided the non-military Japanese leadership with an excuse to proclaim defeat
6556800	6561440	that didn't involve blaming, or shaming, their proud military.
6561440	6564720	It lessened the risk of a revolt of the armed forces,
6564720	6568400	and it was a way to end the war while salvaging some pride,
6568400	6575440	as well as casting those killed by the bombs not as civilian war victims, but as heroic martyrs.
6575440	6580080	The Emperor's radio announcement declaring the end of the war took a similar approach.
6580080	6584880	Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb,
6584880	6588960	the power of which to do damage is indeed incalculable,
6588960	6591920	taking the toll of many innocent lives.
6591920	6596000	Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in an ultimate collapse
6596000	6598160	and obliteration of the Japanese nation,
6598160	6602720	but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.
6602720	6605520	So the bomb allowed the Japanese leadership to say,
6605520	6608640	hey, we weren't beaten in a fair fight here.
6608640	6612720	Our brave military was gearing up for a decisive last battle,
6612720	6616880	but those cowardly Americans, they were too scared to face us.
6616880	6622800	So they invented this terrible bomb and started dropping it on innocent civilians, those monsters.
6622800	6626000	So I suppose we have to be the adults in the room here
6626000	6631440	and agree to stand down before you lunatics go and blow up the whole planet in a nuclear war.
6631440	6638480	So instead of being beaten fairly here, we're sort of like heroes for giving up, right?
6638480	6640800	Does anyone buy that?
6640800	6645840	Now this is desperate spin from a government trying to salvage whatever pride it could.
6645840	6648240	Anyone who takes this at face value,
6648240	6651760	particularly the bit about the toll of many innocent lives,
6651760	6654240	is falling for imperial propaganda.
6654240	6660000	The Emperor and the Japanese leadership did not care about the innocent civilian casualties.
6660000	6665680	The Supreme Council's plan for their civilians was for them to die in a wave of suicide attacks,
6665680	6668560	fighting a vastly better equipped allied military.
6668560	6674080	So do not lie to me that they suddenly came over all sympathetic about their poor subjects.
6674080	6678560	The problem for the Japanese leadership was not that innocent civilians were being killed,
6678560	6683200	it's that innocent civilians were being killed in a manner that was not useful.
6683200	6686560	They didn't want them being blown up in nuclear explosions,
6686560	6690960	they wanted them rushing American machine guns armed with bamboo sticks.
6690960	6693600	If they actually gave a toss about their civilians,
6693600	6698160	they would have surrendered months before they did when it was obvious the war was lost.
6698160	6704000	Instead, they selfishly hung on, trying to save their own positions and reputations.
6704000	6708880	They didn't want to take responsibility for the enormous mistake they had made.
6708880	6713120	So the bomb provided to the Japanese government an excuse to end the war
6713120	6716160	that did not involve blaming anyone in particular.
6716160	6720560	It's not anyone's fault all this, it's not like we did anything wrong,
6720560	6725040	it's just that they've got nuclear bombs now, and there's no accounting for that.
6725040	6728640	So it's possible in this regard that the bombs also shortened the war
6728640	6734240	by providing a face-saving excuse for the Japanese leadership to call it quits.
6734240	6737120	Now, as for whether this was a decisive factor,
6737120	6741840	as in if the bombs didn't exist and the Japanese government had no similar excuse
6741840	6746160	they wouldn't have surrendered when they did, I honestly can't say.
6746160	6750160	However, I will note that both of these possible effects of the bombs,
6750160	6753280	those being speeding up the Soviet declaration of war
6753280	6756880	and providing a face-saving excuse to quit,
6756880	6760960	do not require the bombs to be dropped in the middle of cities.
6760960	6764000	And this is a very important point that often goes overlooked
6764000	6767200	in the debate about whether the bombs were necessary or not.
6767200	6769920	Because beyond whether the bombs were necessary,
6769920	6772560	we also need to ask whether or not it was necessary
6772560	6776320	to use the bombs in the manner in which they were used.
6776320	6781760	There are other ways to use nuclear bombs than to drop them on civilians, of course.
6781760	6785120	On that note, this person is Leo Szilard.
6785120	6789200	Szilard was a Hungarian physicist who, in 1933,
6789200	6792560	conceived the idea of a nuclear chain reaction.
6793120	6797920	Szilard once lived in Germany, but he left when Hitler became the chancellor.
6797920	6801600	In 1939, Szilard approached Albert Einstein
6801600	6804800	and asked him to put his name to a letter Szilard had written,
6804800	6808240	warning then-President Roosevelt about the possibility
6808240	6811280	of Nazi development of nuclear weapons.
6811280	6815280	The Einstein-Zilard letter prompted action by Roosevelt,
6815280	6818320	leading to the creation of the Manhattan Project,
6818320	6820400	which Szilard also worked on.
6820400	6824000	Now, Szilard and many other scientists working on the project
6824000	6827840	were motivated by fears of a nuclear Nazi Germany,
6827840	6830320	something which, thankfully, never came about.
6830320	6833520	Once it was clear the Nazis would be defeated, however,
6833520	6839680	several scientists began warning against the now unnecessary use of the nuclear bomb.
6839680	6843840	A document called the Frank Report was put together in 1945
6843840	6847520	and signed by several prominent physicists, including Szilard.
6847520	6850880	The Frank Report warned about the possibility of the bomb's use
6850880	6853280	triggering an international arms race
6853280	6857200	and strongly advised against an unannounced attack against Japan.
6857200	6861440	The scientists behind the Frank Report instead advised Truman that, quote,
6861440	6864560	"...a demonstration of the new weapon may best be made
6864560	6868080	before the eyes of representatives of all United Nations
6868080	6870720	on the desert or a barren island."
6870720	6873520	Now, allow me to lay my cards on the table here
6873520	6876880	and say that this is how I think things should have been handled.
6876880	6880160	A public announcement and demonstration of the bomb,
6880160	6882720	coupled with an explicit warning to Japan,
6882720	6885840	would have provided the peace faction in the Japanese government
6885840	6890160	with the exact same excuse to quit without blaming their military.
6890160	6892160	The Emperor could still have done his
6892160	6895280	we're pulling out of the war to save the world routine,
6895280	6899200	except without two cities full of civilians being destroyed.
6899200	6902640	If the nuclear bombs were influential in ending the war,
6902640	6906160	it was by their existence, not by their use.
6906160	6908880	In order to use them as an excuse to surrender,
6908880	6912480	the Japanese leadership just needed to know about them,
6912480	6914480	not actually be hit by them.
6914480	6917520	One argument against demonstrating the bomb publicly
6917520	6920240	was that they were worried it might not work.
6920240	6921920	Henry Stimson later wrote that,
6921920	6925520	nothing would have been more damaging to our effort to obtain surrender
6925520	6929200	than a warning or a demonstration followed by a dud,
6929200	6932160	which is a perfectly valid line of reasoning.
6932160	6935760	Until the Trinity test, when you know they work.
6935760	6937920	After that, there's no excuse.
6937920	6940080	And the infuriating thing about this
6940080	6944000	is that if this public demonstration and warning didn't work,
6944000	6947440	you could still then use them against Japan afterwards.
6947440	6950240	I mean, you shouldn't drop them on cities, regardless,
6950240	6952000	but you could do that.
6952000	6954560	Doing it this way around costs you nothing
6954560	6958160	and potentially spurs the lives of two cities full of civilians.
6958160	6962480	The United States absolutely should have went public with the bomb.
6962480	6965920	However, with regards to the Frank Report's suggestions,
6965920	6970240	Groves and Oppenheimer didn't appreciate this bunch of bleeding hearts
6970240	6972800	telling them what to do with their new toy.
6972800	6975600	Oppenheimer had previously written about the quote,
6975600	6978400	fallacy of regarding a controlled test
6978400	6981040	as the culmination of the work of this laboratory.
6981040	6984720	The laboratory is operating under a directive to produce weapons.
6984720	6988800	This directive has been and will be rigorously adhered to.
6988800	6990880	So they didn't put in all this time and effort
6990880	6994960	just to blow up an empty field somewhere for some diplomats and journalists.
6994960	6996400	They were making a weapon
6996400	7000000	and they were going to drop it on a city without warning.
7000000	7002560	The Frank Report was ignored.
7002560	7006000	Not to be deterred, Leo Szilard put together a petition
7006000	7008640	signed by 70 Manhattan Project scientists
7008640	7011200	warning Truman about the possibility of quote,
7011200	7015760	opening the door to an era of devastation on an unimaginable scale.
7015760	7018640	In attempting to get this petition to the president,
7018640	7022720	Szilard, on the 28th of May, met with James Burns,
7022720	7027840	who, I'm sure you can guess, was not very sympathetic to Szilard's view.
7027840	7029360	Szilard later stated,
7029360	7032800	Burns was concerned about Russia's post-war behavior.
7032800	7035680	Russian forces had moved into Hungary and Romania.
7035680	7038320	Burns thought it would be very difficult to persuade Russia
7038320	7040320	to withdraw its troops from these countries
7040320	7045120	and that Russia would be more manageable if impressed by American military might.
7045120	7049680	I shared Burns' concern about Russia's throwing its weight around in the post-war period,
7049680	7052480	but I was completely flabbergasted by the assumption
7052480	7056240	that rattling the bomb might make Russia more manageable.
7056240	7059440	Szilard's petition never did make it to Truman.
7059440	7063600	Now, this quote from Burns here about making the Russians more manageable,
7063600	7067040	along with other documents that came to light in the post-war period,
7067040	7070320	for instance, the target committee's desire for the bomb to be used
7070320	7073280	in a manner that would ensure international recognition,
7073280	7077680	and Truman's diary entries revealing that he knew of the emperor's desire for peace
7077680	7079360	prior to the bombs being used,
7079360	7083120	allowed certain people to construct an alternative historical narrative
7083200	7088480	to the accepted story of America using the bomb to avoid an invasion of Japan.
7088480	7092960	In this new telling, America, thinking ahead to the post-war period,
7092960	7098400	used the bomb primarily as an indirect diplomatic weapon against the Soviet Union,
7098400	7102560	rather than as a direct military weapon against the Empire of Japan.
7102560	7107200	Now, there is evidence to support that this motivation was certainly a factor.
7107200	7111280	It definitely was for Secretary of State James Burns, for instance,
7111280	7116480	but this evidence has led some to conclude that the bombs were dropped solely to intimidate Russia,
7116480	7119040	and this is going much too far, in my opinion.
7119040	7124240	Anyone who points to a singular reason as the explanation for why the bombs were dropped
7124240	7126960	is definitely oversimplifying the history.
7126960	7130400	The bombs were dropped for a combination of many reasons,
7130400	7132480	and let's list some of them.
7132480	7137680	So first, the bombs were dropped, in part, to limit Soviet influence in Asia
7137680	7143440	and make other diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Union go smoother for the United States.
7143440	7146480	Although this turned out to be an enormous miscalculation,
7146480	7150400	it was assumed, incorrectly, that it would take the Soviets a lot longer
7150400	7153440	to develop their own nuclear weapons than it actually did,
7153440	7159280	and the United States would get to enjoy a long stretch of time as the world's only nuclear power.
7159280	7164080	Unbeknownst to Truman, however, Stalin had spies inside the Manhattan Project
7164080	7167600	who were sending plans and information back to Russia,
7167840	7172640	in just a few short years, the Soviet Union would be testing their own nuclear weapons,
7172640	7175520	and the feared arms race was on.
7175520	7179680	Next, the bombs were dropped, in part, to force an end to the war
7179680	7184400	without the United States being seen to back down from unconditional surrender.
7184400	7186880	It was more preferable to certain people
7186880	7190560	that the United States set off nuclear bombs in the middle of cities
7190560	7195920	than the president take a knock to his popularity by looking hypocritical or weak.
7195920	7200640	Another possible reason the bombs were dropped was to justify their expense.
7200640	7203200	Admiral Leahy argues in his memoirs that,
7203200	7207360	"...it was my reaction that the scientists and others wanted to make this test
7207360	7211040	because of the vast sums that had been spent on the project.
7211040	7214240	Truman knew that and so did other people involved."
7214240	7217360	The Manhattan Project was enormously expensive
7217360	7223120	and diverted many of the United States' top scientists and engineers away from other useful work.
7223120	7227840	It was very costly in terms of dollars, materials, and manpower,
7227840	7231840	and the project's management wanted something to show for the expense.
7231840	7236720	They didn't want the culmination of their work to simply be blowing up a field somewhere.
7236720	7239920	Another motivation, surely, was revenge.
7239920	7243920	The White House press release announcing the use of the bomb at Hiroshima stated,
7243920	7247360	"...the Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor.
7247360	7250240	They have been repaid many fold."
7250240	7254960	So this thinking is that the Japanese began the war with a sneak attack.
7254960	7258000	They carried out many war crimes and atrocities.
7258000	7260000	They mistreated prisoners of war.
7260000	7262800	And even though they began the war and lost it,
7262800	7265360	they still arrogantly refused to surrender
7265360	7270800	and dared to try and impose their own surrender terms on the Allied forces that had beaten them.
7270800	7274640	So yeah, we bombed them, but they were asking for it.
7274640	7278320	This motivation would be a lot more sympathetic and understandable
7278320	7281280	had the bombs not been dropped on civilians.
7281280	7284400	Because counter to what the White House press release said,
7284400	7287920	the Japanese did not begin the war at Pearl Harbor.
7287920	7291280	The Japanese leadership and military did that.
7291280	7294160	The Japanese civilians were not consulted.
7294160	7298480	If the United States wanted to use the bombs to pay back Pearl Harbor,
7298480	7301360	they should have dropped one on a military target.
7301360	7304000	Or the Supreme Council, I suppose.
7304000	7305680	Related to that last point,
7305680	7311360	another motivation that influenced the use of the bombs was just basic, regular racism.
7311360	7316560	It is very worth remembering that the racist ideas that inspired Nazi Germany
7316560	7321360	to commit such terrible atrocities were not limited to that country's borders.
7321360	7323760	When we've been talking about America today,
7323760	7328160	it was an America decades prior to the signing of the Civil Rights Act.
7328160	7332320	James Burns, a very influential figure in the events we've been talking about,
7332320	7335120	was a supporter of racial segregation.
7335120	7340320	And President Truman himself referred to the Japanese people as beasts several times.
7340320	7343440	And once, when defending the use of the bombs specifically,
7343440	7344240	he wrote that,
7348800	7351840	This is also undoubtedly one of the reasons that Japan,
7351840	7356080	and not Nazi Germany, was targeted with the nuclear bombs.
7356080	7358400	It was much easier for the people behind the bomb
7358400	7360800	to justify the use of such a destructive weapon
7360800	7364080	if it wasn't going to be used to kill white people.
7364080	7365760	And now, hold up a second,
7365760	7368080	scroll back up, everyone who just scrolled down,
7368080	7369680	to type in the comment box that
7369680	7373280	of course the bombs were used against Japan and not Nazi Germany.
7373280	7377200	Nazi Germany surrendered before the bombs were ready to be used.
7377200	7379040	Now, I know that, obviously,
7379040	7380720	but I didn't say used.
7380720	7382160	I said targeted.
7382160	7385200	And Japan was chosen as the target for the nuclear bombs
7385200	7388160	two years before Nazi Germany's surrender.
7388160	7392560	Japan was chosen as the target way back in 1943.
7392560	7395680	And when General Leslie Groves briefed President Truman
7395680	7399200	about the project in April 1945, he stated,
7403600	7405600	Another factor behind the use of the bombs
7405600	7408640	was simply the momentum of the project.
7408640	7410640	At the top of the United States leadership,
7410640	7413040	there was a vacuum of responsibility.
7413040	7416480	With Roosevelt's death and the newly installed President Truman
7416560	7419840	only just learning about the project near to its completion,
7419840	7423280	there's a sense that things were simply too far along to be halted,
7423280	7425920	without very firm leadership, anyway.
7425920	7429440	Truman's job was not to get in the bomb's way.
7429440	7432880	Leslie Groves described Truman's role in the atomic bombings as,
7439280	7442320	He was a rubber stamp for the project, basically.
7442320	7445840	Truman simply assumed the bomb would be used when ready.
7445840	7450000	He didn't even give a specific order for the first two bombs to be dropped.
7450000	7453920	And after the first two bombs, it was ordered that no more would be dropped
7453920	7456640	without his explicit permission to do so.
7456640	7460480	Which of course implies that they didn't need that permission beforehand.
7460480	7463520	We can see something of an abdication of responsibility
7463520	7465680	among those behind the nuclear bomb.
7465680	7467680	In his memoirs, Truman states,
7467680	7470800	I had realized, of course, that the atomic bomb explosion
7470800	7474160	would inflict damage and casualties beyond imagination.
7474160	7477600	On the other hand, the scientific advisors of the committee reported,
7477600	7481840	We can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war.
7481840	7485520	We see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.
7485520	7489360	It was their conclusion that no technical demonstration they might propose,
7489360	7493200	such as over a deserted island, would be likely to bring the war to an end.
7493200	7496320	It had to be used against an enemy target.
7496320	7500880	On the other hand, several top Manhattan Project scientists, including Oppenheimer,
7500880	7505920	made efforts to distance themselves from what they claimed was merely a military decision.
7506000	7509040	In a report issued on the 16th of June, they stated that,
7509040	7514480	We have no claim to special competence in solving the political, social, and military problems
7514480	7517360	which are presented by the advent of atomic power.
7517360	7519920	Oppenheimer also later stated that,
7519920	7523520	We didn't know beans about the military situation in Japan.
7523520	7526720	We didn't know whether they could be caused to surrender by other means,
7526720	7529440	or whether the invasion was really inevitable.
7529440	7533200	So Truman's sharing responsibility with the scientists here, saying,
7533200	7535920	Well, I knew the bomb was gonna be horrible, obviously,
7535920	7539680	but the scientists told me a peaceful demonstration would never work,
7539680	7543040	and that I had to drop it on a city, so, you know.
7543040	7544400	And the scientists are saying,
7544400	7547600	Hey, well, what are you listening to us for? We don't know.
7547600	7549680	We're physicists. We just built the thing.
7549680	7553040	We don't know about foreign policy or military strategy.
7553040	7556480	There's a sense that nobody's really in control of this thing.
7556480	7560800	The ball was rolling, and nobody had the inclination to stop it.
7560800	7563520	I would like to add, however, that regardless of any of this,
7563520	7567280	Truman is still responsible here, and he still made a decision,
7567280	7570720	even if it was more of a passive decision than an active one.
7570720	7574960	Now, all this has led some to wonder about whether or not the bombs would have been used
7574960	7578080	had President Roosevelt not died when he did.
7578080	7582640	Albert Einstein, who I'm told was a rather smart guy in certain regards,
7582640	7584720	came to this conclusion, stating that,
7584720	7589440	The use of the atomic bombs was precipitated by a desire to end the war in the Pacific
7589520	7592400	by any means before Russia's participation.
7592400	7595200	I'm sure if President Roosevelt had still been there,
7595200	7597120	none of that would have been possible.
7597120	7601840	So as we've seen, the bombs were dropped for a combination of many reasons,
7601840	7605520	but none of these was to avoid an invasion of Japan.
7605520	7609120	By the time it was an option to drop nuclear bombs on Japan,
7609120	7611680	an invasion was already off the table.
7611680	7613840	It was no longer necessary.
7613840	7617680	Both Truman and Burns thought that Japan was going to surrender
7617680	7620640	because of the upcoming Russian declaration of war,
7620640	7625760	and the bombs were dropped, in part, to attempt to force a surrender prior to that.
7625760	7628160	Before we wrap up today, we should ask,
7628160	7631200	Where did this invasion narrative come from?
7631200	7634960	Why is it the enduring popular perception of events?
7634960	7637200	Let's return to the start of the video,
7637200	7641600	and talk again about what I called the trolley problem version of events.
7641600	7644400	Now, I have a confession to make about this.
7644400	7649600	What I do when I want to find an example of a poor argument put forward ineptly,
7649600	7653760	is go and check if Prager University has ever made a video on the topic.
7653760	7657040	And would you know it, they have made one about the nuclear bombs,
7657040	7660720	titled, Was it wrong to drop the atom bomb on Japan?
7660720	7664480	Which, of course, concludes it was completely justified.
7664480	7667520	And the version of events written at the start of my video
7667520	7671760	is constructed almost entirely out of statements made in their video.
7671760	7676240	So, that's right, this was a stealth PragerU response video this whole time.
7676240	7677280	What a twist.
7677280	7681040	So this PragerU video starts out by giving far too much agency
7681040	7684640	to a certain Mr. President Truman, when they say,
7684640	7687840	Truman sought to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
7687840	7692560	two major military industrial targets, to avoid an invasion of Japan.
7692560	7696960	So they're assigning to Truman the decision of which targets to bomb there.
7696960	7701680	Now, Truman had no input on deciding to target Hiroshima or Nagasaki,
7701920	7706720	he didn't even know Nagasaki was going to be bombed until after it already had been.
7706720	7712080	Nagasaki wasn't even the target city of the plane that dropped the bomb on Nagasaki,
7712080	7716320	it only got attacked because the primary targets was too cloudy to hit.
7716320	7719040	Now, I could pick through this video line by line,
7719040	7721520	giving rebuttals like this to each of its claims,
7721520	7723600	but this video is long enough already,
7723600	7726160	so instead I just want to focus on two quotes
7726160	7729440	that concern the bombs versus invasion narrative.
7729440	7730880	And the first is this,
7730880	7735040	it was only the dropping of the atom bombs that allowed the emperor
7735040	7738640	and the so-called peace faction in the Japanese government
7738640	7741440	to negotiate an end to the war.
7741440	7744880	Now, this is just a total inversion of reality.
7744880	7749200	The atom bombs did not allow the emperor to negotiate an end to the war,
7749200	7752480	either with the United States or within his own government.
7752480	7755360	The problem was not that, prior to the bombs,
7755360	7759360	Japan was refusing to negotiate an end to the war,
7759360	7763840	it's that they were insisting on negotiating an end to the war.
7763840	7768160	The United States was the country refusing to negotiate an end to the war
7768160	7771200	because they were insisting on unconditional surrender.
7771200	7775680	And the emperor didn't negotiate an end to the war within his own government,
7775680	7777120	he was the emperor.
7777120	7779120	The government did what he said.
7779120	7784240	The militarists wanted to fight to the death even after the nuclear bombs were dropped.
7784240	7787760	There was no negotiation, there was no convincing them,
7787760	7791520	it was a deadlock broken by the emperor's divine ruling.
7791520	7795680	This idea that the Japanese leadership were committed to total war
7795680	7801520	only until the bombs forced them to the negotiating table is entirely false.
7801520	7804720	I also have a particular distaste for the phrasing
7804720	7807760	it was only the dropping of the atom bomb
7807760	7811520	because Imperial Japan was beaten long before the nuclear bombs were dropped
7811520	7816240	and pretending that it took the nuclear bombs to defeat Japan is not only untrue,
7816240	7818400	it's a dangerous exaggeration.
7818400	7821680	It makes the Empire of Japan into such a powerful enemy
7821680	7824400	that you need nuclear force to take them down
7824400	7826000	and it covers up the reality,
7826000	7829600	which is that Imperial Japan was already a defeated state
7829600	7832400	run by incompetent, ignorant leaders.
7832400	7835280	The next quote I want to talk about is this.
7835280	7839120	All the viable alternate scenarios to secure American victory,
7839120	7843120	all would have meant significantly greater American and Allied casualties
7843120	7847040	and much higher Japanese civilian and military casualties.
7847040	7849840	According to American military estimates at the time,
7849840	7853040	those numbers would have been well above one million.
7853040	7855840	Now, you may have noticed today that we have not thus far
7855840	7858480	discussed what the projected wartime casualties
7858480	7861600	of a full Allied invasion of Japan were going to be.
7861600	7866080	And that's because until after the war, there were no such projections made.
7866080	7868960	This quote from PragerU here is a lie.
7868960	7872800	The enormously high death estimates for a full invasion of Japan
7872800	7876160	were entirely a post-war fabrication.
7876160	7879280	Now, before we talk about where this one million figure came from,
7879280	7882800	I'd like to remind everyone that an invasion was unnecessary
7882800	7885200	and not going to happen anyway.
7885200	7887280	Whatever death estimates you come up with,
7887280	7890160	a thousand, a million, a hundred million,
7890160	7891520	it does not matter.
7891520	7894080	An invasion was not going to happen
7894080	7896880	and the bombs were not used to avert it.
7896880	7898720	Right, so with that in mind,
7898720	7902000	this one million figure comes from an article published
7902000	7906880	in Henry Stimson's name in Harper's Magazine in 1947.
7906880	7909840	This article was written in response to various criticisms
7909840	7911440	of the use of the atomic bomb,
7911440	7914240	which had begun emerging after the end of the war,
7914240	7917920	and it was edited by various people responsible for the bomb,
7917920	7920240	including General Leslie Groves.
7920240	7923600	The article lays out the trolley problem excuse.
7923600	7926640	We simply had to do the nuclear bombs, it argues.
7926640	7928560	There was no other way.
7928560	7931280	Talking about the apparently inevitable invasion,
7931280	7932320	the article states,
7932320	7935520	"...I was informed that such operations might be expected
7935520	7939840	to cost over a million casualties to American forces alone."
7939840	7941520	Now, as I've already stated,
7941520	7944400	there is no evidence of such an estimate being made
7944400	7946080	prior to the end of the war,
7946080	7949760	and President Truman at no point presented the nuclear bombs
7949760	7952560	as an alternative to an Allied invasion of Japan
7952560	7956400	until he had to justify the use of the bombs after the war.
7956400	7959440	Only then did the invasion become inevitable,
7959440	7962880	and did the death estimates shoot up into the millions.
7962880	7967040	This is where the atom bombs versus invasion narrative comes from.
7967040	7968480	After the bomb was dropped,
7968480	7972160	the US leadership started telling lies about it.
7972160	7977440	President Truman himself got started very early on August 9th, 1945,
7977440	7979440	when he addressed the nation with a speech
7979440	7982560	seeking to justify the use of the nuclear bomb,
7982560	7983680	and I quote,
7983680	7987840	"...the world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima,
7987840	7989520	a military base.
7989520	7992480	That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid,
7992480	7995600	insofar as possible, the killing of civilians."
7996160	7998240	Now, this is a lie, obviously.
7998240	7999840	Hiroshima was a city.
7999840	8002800	The bomb's target committee describes it as a city.
8002800	8006400	Remember that Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size
8006400	8009840	that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed.
8009840	8012720	And Truman's lying continues as follows,
8012720	8015760	"...but that attack is only a warning of things to come.
8015760	8017440	If Japan does not surrender,
8017440	8020720	bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries,
8020720	8024560	and unfortunately, thousands of civilian lives will be lost.
8024560	8029120	I urge Japanese civilians to leave industrial cities immediately,
8029120	8031600	and save themselves from destruction."
8031600	8035680	So Truman isn't justifying the bombing of Hiroshima by saying
8035680	8038480	it was a city with several war industries in it,
8038480	8041360	which is what the eventual excuse came to be.
8041360	8045520	He's going for broke here and saying it was solely a military base,
8045520	8047200	and that unless Japan surrenders,
8047200	8050480	bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries,
8050480	8053040	implying that that has not happened already.
8053040	8058080	Averting an invasion was not given as a reason for using the bombs in this speech,
8058080	8060720	because they hadn't come up with that excuse yet.
8060720	8066720	Truman also here claims the bomb was used to spare the lives of thousands and thousands,
8066720	8069840	not the later claimed millions and millions.
8069840	8072320	Another lie that became popular after the war
8072320	8078080	was that the nuclear bomb was dropped in response to Japan ignoring the Potsdam Declaration.
8078080	8081120	However, the only existing direct order to go ahead
8081120	8083440	with the use of the nuclear bombs against Japan
8083440	8086400	was issued prior to the Potsdam Declaration.
8086400	8089600	Not by Truman, of course, he didn't have anything to do with it.
8089600	8093520	It was drafted by Leslie Groves, approved by Henry Stimson,
8093520	8095600	and delivered to General Karl Spatz,
8095600	8099840	commander of the Strategic Air Forces, on July the 25th,
8099840	8103040	the day before the Potsdam Declaration was issued.
8103040	8105120	They did not wait for a response
8105120	8108240	before issuing the order to proceed with the atomic bombings.
8108240	8112880	The order was issued before Japan had even seen the surrender terms.
8112880	8115520	As a result of these lies and others,
8115520	8119440	the simplified version of the history came into existence.
8119440	8122240	And it isn't hard to understand why this caught on.
8122880	8128000	Firstly, it took me two minutes at the top of the video to explain the easy lie,
8128000	8132160	and the whole rest of the video to explain the much more complicated truth.
8132160	8138320	The bombs versus invasion narrative is simple, it's plausible, and it's easy to understand.
8139200	8143760	It isn't true, of course, but why let that get in the way of a good story?
8143760	8147360	But the invasion narrative is not just easier to understand,
8147360	8149360	it's also easier to accept.
8149360	8154800	Because if we question it, we have to contend with the possibility, or the certainty,
8154800	8156960	that the United States of America
8156960	8162160	incinerated two cities full of innocent civilians for no good reason.
8162160	8164080	Given the enormous death toll,
8164080	8168960	the truth, that the use of the bombs was pointless and accomplished nothing,
8168960	8171280	is very difficult to accept.
8171280	8174480	Now, it's about time for me to conclude this video here.
8174480	8177520	And trying to neatly sum up such a complicated event
8177520	8181120	with so many actors all with their own contradictory motivations
8181120	8183600	is surely an exercise in frustration.
8183600	8185600	There is no doing it justice.
8186400	8189600	That said, the nuclear bombs used against Japan
8189600	8192640	were an expensive gamble that did not pay off.
8192640	8195600	They were dropped on civilians, intentionally,
8195600	8198320	per the flawed strategy of morale bombing,
8198320	8201040	to force Japan to surrender unconditionally
8201040	8203520	before the Soviet Union joined the war.
8204400	8206800	In this, they were a complete failure.
8206800	8210560	The lie that the bombs were used only to avert an invasion of Japan
8210560	8212640	was a post-war construction,
8212640	8216560	intended to provide justification for a completely avoidable
8216560	8220320	and indefensible slaughter of innocent civilians.
8220320	8223200	The civilians who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki
8223200	8226800	were not killed to avert an invasion of Japan,
8226800	8231600	nor did they bravely give their lives in sacrifice to save their empire.
8231600	8234480	Their deaths were entirely unnecessary,
8234560	8236800	and we owe it to them to admit that.
8237680	8239840	Often, when terrible injustices
8239840	8242720	towards the inhabitants of one country are discussed,
8242720	8244080	the response will come,
8244080	8246560	well, what about all the terrible injustices
8246560	8249200	carried out by that country to other people?
8249200	8252480	This is a question that has varying motivations behind it
8252480	8254640	of varying legitimacy.
8254640	8257920	On the one hand, certain events from the Second World War,
8257920	8260400	and wider history in general, I suppose,
8260400	8263040	do get much more attention and discussion,
8263040	8264320	for whatever reasons,
8264320	8266960	than other events of equal importance.
8266960	8270000	And it is perfectly valid to ask that we do not forget
8270000	8273280	that Imperial Japan committed many terrible war crimes
8273280	8275840	and was, both during and before the war,
8275840	8279840	a brutal totalitarian oppressor of many different people.
8279840	8282080	I think it's very important to make clear here
8282080	8283840	that nothing we've talked about today
8283840	8286160	should generate any sympathy whatsoever
8286160	8288800	for Imperial Japan as a concept
8288800	8292880	or the leadership of the Imperial Japanese government or military.
8292880	8295840	The crimes of the Empire of Japan were dreadful,
8295840	8299360	and there is no punishment that perpetrators would not deserve.
8299360	8301840	And many of these crimes, it is worth pointing out,
8301840	8304480	have went either ignored or unapologized for
8304480	8307120	by the Japanese government to this day.
8307120	8308560	All that being said,
8308560	8312400	we must be careful to accurately allocate fault here.
8312400	8314960	Because unfortunately, that same question,
8314960	8317120	what about all the stuff they did,
8317120	8320160	is not always asked with such innocent intentions.
8320160	8323600	Sometimes this question reveals something very worrisome,
8323600	8326000	and that's the belief in racial crimes
8326000	8327840	that can be avenged with violence
8327840	8330080	towards other members of that group.
8330080	8333840	And this is the worst sort of us versus them thinking.
8333840	8337120	They did something bad to us, so they,
8337120	8340640	and by they I mean anyone I reckon is in that group,
8340640	8343360	deserves something bad in return.
8343360	8346160	So while we should have no sympathy whatsoever
8346160	8348000	for the Empire of Japan,
8348000	8350960	the schoolchildren of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
8350960	8353520	were not the Empire of Japan.
8353520	8355520	They were some schoolchildren.
8355520	8358080	They had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor.
8358080	8360800	They did not consent to go to war.
8360800	8363840	They were needlessly put in danger by one power,
8363840	8365920	and needlessly killed by another.
8366480	8368880	Nothing was avenged or paid back.
8368880	8370320	There was no point to it,
8370320	8372320	but to provide yet more evidence
8372320	8375520	that there's no monopoly held by any nation or race
8375520	8378480	on a disregard for the lives of the powerless.
