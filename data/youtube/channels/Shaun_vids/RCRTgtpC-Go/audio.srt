00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,680
Today, we're going to be talking about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,680
And let's start today by telling a story.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,560
So, at the conclusion to the Second World War, Japan, though their military forces had been soundly defeated,

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,440
stubbornly refused to negotiate an end to the conflict.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,920
Their militaristic leaders had committed to total war in defense of the Japanese Empire,

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,880
and were prepared to mobilize Japanese civilians to combat any potential American invasion.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,760
President Harry Truman and his advisors were therefore faced with a difficult choice.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
Either they could commit to a long and costly invasion of Japan,

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,440
which they estimated would kill more than a million people,

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,560
or they could use their secret weapon, the world's first nuclear bombs,

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,560
which the United States had recently constructed.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,480
So, in order to shorten the war and avoid the need for an invasion,

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:02,600
Truman decided to drop two bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, two major military and industrial targets.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,440
Demonstrating the extent of the Japanese military's desire to keep fighting, however,

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,560
even after these bombs were dropped, Japan's Supreme Council remained deadlocked,

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,360
with some military leaders still refusing to consider negotiating a peace.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,880
It took the unprecedented intervention of Emperor Hirohito to break the impasse in the council,

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,640
and finally convinced the military to stand down,

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
bringing an end to the war.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,880
So, that's quite a simple story there.

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,560
And presented like this, dropping the nuclear bombs was pretty unambiguously the right and moral thing to do,

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,560
when compared to the worse alternative, anyway.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,200
What this is is a basic trolley problem.

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,440
You might not like dropping the nuclear bombs,

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,360
but if the only other option on the table is a long, costly invasion

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,480
that is definitely going to kill and injure even more people,

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
then the bombs become acceptable.

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
And justifiable.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,280
And this is a popular and enduring perception of the events that led to the nuclear bombs being dropped,

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,720
that they were used specifically to force Japan to surrender, without the need for an invasion.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,320
However, this is Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy,

33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,480
who was the senior-most United States military officer on active duty during World War II,

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,920
and the personal chief of staff to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,640
And after the war, with regards to the nuclear bombs, Leahy wrote the following.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,880
It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,280
was of no material assistance in our war against Japan.

38
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,320
The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,280
because of the effect of sea blockade and bombing with conventional weapons.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,400
Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, who was commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet during World War II,

41
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,360
said, at a speech given on October 5th, 1945,

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,280
the Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace before the atomic age was announced to the world

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,520
with the destruction of Hiroshima, and before the Russian entry into the war.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,320
The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military standpoint, in the defeat of Japan.

45
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,280
And this is General Dwight Eisenhower, who was supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,760
during World War II, and later President of the United States.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,160
And his opinion of the atomic bomb was that the Japanese were ready to surrender,

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,840
and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing.

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,160
And Eisenhower later wrote in his memoirs about a conversation he had with War Secretary Henry Stimson,

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,440
in which he states,

51
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:58,080
It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender.

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,000
And in 1944, President Roosevelt directed Henry Stimson to put together a survey team

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,800
to write a report on the effectiveness of the Allied aerial bombing tactics during the war.

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,960
Published in 1946, this strategic bombing survey came to the conclusion that Japan would have surrendered

55
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,840
even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war,

56
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,440
and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.

57
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,880
So, what's going on here, then?

58
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,480
The people I just quoted there were all involved in the Second World War

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,240
in important positions of political and military power.

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,560
And instead of viewing the bombs as a necessary lesser-of-two-evils,

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,560
they instead see them as everything from simply militarily unnecessary to a grave moral crime.

62
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,600
Now, obviously, if these people are correct that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

63
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,760
were not necessary to end the war,

64
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,680
then the trolley problem version of the story we told at the start of the video can't be true, can it?

65
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
So, this is what we're here to investigate today.

66
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Which of these versions of history is closer to the truth?

67
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,240
We're going to take a look at the closing months of the Second World War

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,480
in the lead-up to the atomic bombings.

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,040
And I think we should start today by briefly introducing

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,680
the various people that we're going to be talking about,

71
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,840
a few of whom we've mentioned already.

72
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,240
So, first off, in the United States, we have President Franklin D. Roosevelt,

73
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
who was in office for most of the Second World War.

74
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,720
Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945,

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,560
meaning that his vice president, Harry Truman, became president,

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
and he was in office for the remainder of the war,

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,320
including the period when the nuclear bombs were dropped.

78
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Working for Truman, we have Chief of Staff Admiral William D. Leahy,

79
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,320
who was one of the people we just quoted who thought the bombs were unnecessary,

80
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
Secretary of War Henry L. Stimpson,

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,880
who was the person to whom Eisenhower voiced his misgivings about the bomb,

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
and Secretary of State James F. Burns.

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,640
And, spoiler warning, this man in particular makes a lot of very poor decisions.

84
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,080
Leahy and Stimpson both served in the same roles under Roosevelt,

85
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,400
but James F. Burns was appointed Secretary of State by Harry Truman on July 3, 1945.

86
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,080
The nuclear bombs themselves were constructed by the Manhattan Project,

87
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,720
which was directed by General Leslie Groves,

88
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,680
and the actual laboratory that designed the bombs was headed by J. Robert Oppenheimer.

89
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,640
Over in Japan, at the top of the Japanese government, we have Emperor Hirohito,

90
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,960
and he was advised by the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War.

91
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,800
The Supreme Council had six members, and they, for the most part,

92
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,640
fell into two factions, the Moderates and the Hardliners.

93
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,240
So for the Moderates, we have Prime Minister Kantaro Suzuki,

94
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,960
Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo,

95
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,840
and Minister of the Navy Mitsumasa Yonai.

96
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,080
And for the Hardliners, we have Minister of War Kurechika Anami,

97
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,360
Chief of the Army General Staff Yoshijirō Umezu,

98
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,400
and Chief of the Navy General Staff Soemu Toyoda.

99
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,440
We'll get more into the differences between these groups in a little while,

100
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,240
but generally the Hardliners favored a more hardline military strategy,

101
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,320
and the Moderates were more... moderate.

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,000
Also important for us here is Naotake Sato,

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union,

104
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,960
who was in frequent contact with Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo.

105
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,640
And the messages sent between Togo and Sato are key to understanding

106
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,600
the thinking of the Japanese leadership at the time.

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,080
Outside of the US and Japan, we have British Prime Minister Winston Churchill

108
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
and Premier of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin.

109
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
I don't know if you've ever heard of them.

110
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,320
Now, of course, there were many more people than this

111
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,480
involved in the end of the Second World War,

112
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,960
and I'll be mentioning more people going forward.

113
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,080
This list comprises only the most principal actors

114
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,040
in the particular events that we're going to be talking about today.

115
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,120
As well as people, there's going to be a lot of dates and events to remember here,

116
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
so I'm going to be using a calendar going forward

117
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
so that we can keep track of everything.

118
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,640
The two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

119
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,520
on the 6th and 9th of August, respectively.

120
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,680
And we've also already mentioned the inauguration of Harry Truman on the 12th of April

121
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,720
and his appointing of James Burns to Secretary of State on the 3rd of July.

122
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,040
As we go through the events leading up to the bombings,

123
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,600
I'll add more to this calendar and highlight which days I'm talking about in particular,

124
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,160
and hopefully this will help us to keep organized.

125
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,000
Before all that, though, there is one important event we need to know about

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
prior to the Second World War,

127
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,720
and that's the Russo-Japanese War fought between 1904 and 1905.

128
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,040
Now, I won't dwell on this too long,

129
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,480
but the very quick Wikipedia summary goes like this.

130
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,400
The Russo-Japanese War was fought between the Russian and Japanese empires

131
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,240
over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea.

132
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,960
So it's two empires fighting over land and influence in Asia, basically.

133
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,320
Anyway, in this war, Russia suffered a series of humiliating and surprising defeats

134
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,800
at the hands of Japan, a nation that Russia was expecting to beat relatively easily.

135
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,480
Perhaps most notable of these defeats is the Battle of Tsushima,

136
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,320
where virtually a whole Russian fleet was sunk by the Japanese navy

137
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,960
who suffered only minor losses themselves.

138
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,200
Russia was forced to sue for peace,

139
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,520
which was mediated in the United States by President Theodore Roosevelt,

140
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,520
and the resulting treaty saw Russia withdrawing their troops from Manchuria,

141
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,160
recognizing Japan's claim to Korea, as well as ceding a bunch of territory.

142
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,160
All this coupled with the fact that the Japanese Empire had initiated the war

143
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,920
with a surprise attack on the Russian-occupied Port Arthur

144
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,800
meant that the Russians were, to put it lightly, rather ticked off about the whole affair.

145
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,280
The disastrous Russian performance in the war

146
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,480
is considered one of the main instigating factors behind the 1905 Russian Revolution,

147
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,880
but that's a story for another day.

148
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,680
So to summarize and generalize a bit,

149
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,880
Russia held a grudge against Japan for beating them in a war

150
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,480
and denying them influence and territory in Asia.

151
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,920
This is all important in the context of the Yalta Conference,

152
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,760
which took place between the 4th and 11th of February there.

153
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,600
This was a meeting of Stalin, Churchill, and Franklin D. Roosevelt

154
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,320
to discuss, among other things, the post-war reorganization of Europe.

155
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,800
Nazi Germany was on its last legs at this point, its defeat was inevitable.

156
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,680
Adolf Hitler shot himself on the 30th of April,

157
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,520
and the German high command surrendered unconditionally on May the 7th.

158
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,560
And the Yalta Conference was held to discuss and negotiate

159
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,040
the various things that should happen following that upcoming Nazi defeat.

160
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,520
The main focus of the conference was Europe,

161
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,880
but important for us here is that the Soviet Union's entry into the war against Japan was discussed.

162
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,280
Churchill and Roosevelt wanted Stalin to declare war on Japan.

163
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,440
Specifically, they wanted him to invade Japanese-occupied Manchuria,

164
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,840
which would make Japan have to fight on an extra front and spread their resources thinner,

165
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,400
and this would hopefully hasten their defeat.

166
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Now, this was a little bit awkward as Russia and Japan had signed a non-aggression pact in 1941,

167
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,000
and that wasn't due to expire until 1946.

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,520
Despite this non-aggression pact, Stalin also wanted Russia to declare war against Japan.

169
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,160
However, he wanted something in return.

170
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,080
So on the 11th of February, the Allies signed a secret protocol

171
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,560
agreeing that Russia would enter the war against Japan,

172
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,320
two or three months after Germany has surrendered and the war in Europe is terminated.

173
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,240
And the price for Russia's doing so was that the former rights of Russia

174
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,840
violated by the treacherous attack of Japan in 1904 shall be restored.

175
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,360
And then they're all listed there.

176
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,720
So basically, Stalin was asked to declare war on Japan after the war in Europe was finished,

177
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,400
and he said, okay, but we want back all the stuff that Japan pinched off us back in 1904.

178
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,920
Churchill and Roosevelt agreed, and so the deal was made.

179
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,520
And this deal was kept secret for a few reasons, mainly because Russia is very big.

180
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,400
It was going to take quite a bit of time for the Soviet Union

181
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,840
to transfer military forces from the west to the east,

182
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,760
and they didn't want to risk tipping Japan off to the impending invasion of Manchuria

183
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
before it was ready to go ahead.

184
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
President Roosevelt, for his part, thought this was a fair deal.

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,360
He later stated that the Russians, quote,

186
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
"...only want to get back that which has been taken from them."

187
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,440
However, James Burns, then acting as advisor to Roosevelt at Yalta,

188
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,280
worried that the more the United States asked of the Soviet Union,

189
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,520
the more they would demand in return.

190
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,680
Writing in his memoirs after the war,

191
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,400
Burns makes it clear that he thinks too much was conceded to the Russians at Yalta,

192
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,680
although he is careful to give reasons as to why he thinks

193
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
the late President Roosevelt made the decisions he did.

194
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,400
Burns does point out, however, that at the time the terms of the secret protocol were decided upon,

195
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,600
he didn't know about them and thus had no influence over them

196
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,400
because he was not Secretary of State.

197
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Mr. Stettinius was Secretary, referring to Edward Stettinius Jr.,

198
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,480
who was Roosevelt's Secretary of State at Yalta.

199
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,840
This is important for us here because although Truman kept on

200
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,320
other of Roosevelt's staff after his death,

201
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
he chose to replace Stettinius,

202
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,800
feeling that too many concessions had been made to the Soviet Union at Yalta.

203
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,720
And his new pick for Secretary of State was James Burns,

204
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,600
a choice which signals a change towards a more aggressive stance with regards to Russia.

205
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,560
Which leaves the United States in a bit of an awkward situation, diplomatically speaking.

206
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,280
Under the previous President and Secretary of State,

207
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,240
they'd signed a secret agreement with the Soviet Union,

208
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,320
assuring them various concessions in exchange for going to war against Japan.

209
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,480
But then that President died and his Secretary of State was replaced.

210
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,200
And the incoming President and Secretary of State

211
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,960
aren't at all as keen on conceding anything to the Russians.

212
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,880
And I wonder if that's going to cause any problems down the line.

213
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,320
So let's leave the Allies in their awkward situation there

214
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,160
and discuss what the Japanese government was up to during this time.

215
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,080
And to oversimplify a little, throughout this whole period,

216
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,160
the Japanese leadership had basically a single main aim.

217
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
And that was to avoid having to accept an unconditional surrender

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,120
and instead achieve a negotiated peace.

219
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,400
The Supreme Council in Japan knew that they couldn't win the war,

220
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,080
but they wanted peace on terms that they could negotiate.

221
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,440
Nazi Germany, of course, was forced to accept an unconditional surrender by the Allies.

222
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,280
Unconditional surrender here meaning surrender without any guarantees being made to the losing side.

223
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,120
And Japan was very keen to avoid a similar fate.

224
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,760
The main sticking point was the question of Japan's imperial institution

225
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
and the fate of the Emperor in particular.

226
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,880
The Emperor was more than just a regular old leader in Japanese society.

227
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,080
He was a revered, quasi-divine figure of particularly special importance.

228
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,280
And with his position as the head of the Japanese government,

229
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,080
and importantly, the Japanese military,

230
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,360
Japan accepting unconditional surrender meant that the Emperor could then conceivably be arrested

231
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,280
and tried for war crimes and possibly even executed.

232
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,160
This was something that Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, when advising General MacArthur,

233
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,640
described as comparable to the crucifixion of Christ to us.

234
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,720
The United States was very aware of the special position of the Emperor

235
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,840
and the gravity of the question of what should be done with him,

236
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
but we'll get to that a little later.

237
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,720
Now, there were disagreements in Japan's Supreme Council

238
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,720
about what exact peace terms they should attempt to negotiate.

239
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,160
On the more pessimistic, or realistic, end of the scale,

240
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,760
we have Japan just getting out of the war however they can

241
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,400
with the preservation of the imperial institution.

242
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,360
So basically accepting whatever peace terms are offered

243
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
so long as they guarantee the Emperor's position.

244
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,320
And on the more optimistic, or unrealistic, end of the scale,

245
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,600
we have Japan getting out of the war while securing the preservation of the imperial institution,

246
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
securing the preservation of Japan's military forces,

247
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,120
avoiding a foreign occupation,

248
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,400
maintaining Japan's occupied overseas territories,

249
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,840
and ensuring any trials for Japanese war crimes were carried out by Japan.

250
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,000
Now this was all never going to happen, obviously, but it was argued for.

251
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,520
The hardline militarists on the council were very keen on the preservation of the military,

252
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,560
believe it or not.

253
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,320
Holding out for these terms was obviously a desperate long shot,

254
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,640
but these were equally desperate men.

255
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,800
Regardless of these disagreements though,

256
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,160
the Supreme Council was unified on the first point.

257
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,280
They were absolutely not going to lose the Emperor,

258
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,520
and therefore they want to avoid an unconditional surrender at any cost.

259
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,520
And they pursued this goal both militarily and diplomatically.

260
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,160
And let's talk about military strategy first.

261
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,480
So the militarists on the Supreme Council

262
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,000
favored a strategy of making the war so difficult for the Allies

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,960
that they would lose their taste for unconditional surrender

264
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,120
and decide to negotiate peace,

265
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,440
rather than fight on for another year or so at huge cost to themselves.

266
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,000
So Japan wasn't going to win the war.

267
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,040
They knew that.

268
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,440
But they were going to end it on terms that were more acceptable to them.

269
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,200
The council anticipated an upcoming Allied invasion of Japan

270
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,000
and planned to throw everything they had at it,

271
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,600
including civilians,

272
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,080
in order to wear down the Allied will to fight and thus secure better terms.

273
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,560
A similar situation played out in miniature on the island of Okinawa.

274
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,080
Now, Okinawa was occupied by the Japanese military,

275
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,240
and when the US military invaded it,

276
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,280
local inhabitants of the island, including children,

277
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,840
were conscripted by the Japanese military and sent to die by the thousands.

278
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,760
And by the time Okinawa was captured by the Allies on July the 2nd,

279
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,840
both the Japanese and US militaries had lost considerable amounts of lives and military equipment.

280
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,160
It was both a very costly loss and a very costly victory.

281
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,720
President Truman, for his part, was very concerned about the losses at Okinawa

282
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
and feared that committing to a full invasion of Japan could mean, quote,

283
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,000
"...an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other."

284
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,440
So that's the Supreme Council's military strategy there.

285
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,360
Diplomatically, the council's plan was to convince the Soviet Union

286
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,640
to mediate a peace between Japan and the other Allies,

287
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,280
much like the United States that mediated peace at the end of the Russo-Japanese War.

288
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,600
Japan was counting on the pact of neutrality they had with the Soviet Union

289
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,920
to keep the Russians out of the war.

290
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,840
They hoped that they would have a better chance at securing favorable peace terms

291
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
if they had the Soviet Union backing them up,

292
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,480
and in exchange for helping them with negotiations,

293
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,280
the Japanese leadership was prepared to offer Stalin

294
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,480
various territorial concessions from their empire.

295
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,800
Now, unfortunately for the Japanese people,

296
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,360
both the military and diplomatic strategies of the Japanese leadership were,

297
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
to put it bluntly, rubbish.

298
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,840
To take the diplomatic strategy first,

299
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,400
in trying to persuade Stalin to help them out,

300
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
they were bargaining from a position of weakness.

301
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,680
They had nothing to offer the Soviet Union

302
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,120
that it was not in a position to just take for itself.

303
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Stalin didn't want the war to end

304
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,560
before he'd had the chance to invade and recapture the territory

305
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,000
that had already been promised to him at the Yalta Conference.

306
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,360
So why bargain with Japan in exchange for helping them

307
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,400
when you could just invade them and take whatever you like?

308
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,680
Stalin wanted to be in at the kill, as he put it,

309
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,200
and he wasn't about to grant Japan a stay of execution.

310
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,080
To accomplish this impossible diplomatic task,

311
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,800
Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo

312
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,240
sent frequent messages to Japan's ambassador in Moscow,

313
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,520
Naotake Sato,

314
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,000
instructing him to somehow convince the Russians to help Japan broker peace.

315
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,800
Now, Sato was rather a lot more realistic than his colleagues back in Tokyo.

316
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,160
He knew the Russians,

317
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,560
he realized that the Council's plan was almost certainly not going to work,

318
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,640
and he didn't mind telling them.

319
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,360
In a series of increasingly frank messages

320
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,520
sent in response to Togo's instructions,

321
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,960
Sato attempted to make his superiors see sense.

322
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
And let's quote a few of his cables here.

323
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,520
It seems extremely unlikely that Russia would flout the Anglo-Americans

324
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,600
and the opinion of the entire world

325
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,240
by supporting Japan's war efforts with either moral or material means.

326
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,360
I believe in the long run Japan has indeed no choice

327
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,080
but to accept unconditional surrender or terms closely equivalent.

328
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,920
I believe that Stalin feels there is absolutely no necessity

329
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,880
for making a voluntary agreement with Japan.

330
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,880
On this point, I see a serious discrepancy between your view

331
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,280
and the actual state of affairs,

332
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,760
which is a wonderfully insulting line there.

333
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,800
Togo, however, didn't appreciate his subordinate's candor.

334
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,840
He responded to one of Sato's complaints, quote,

335
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,480
"...in spite of your views, you must carry out your instructions.

336
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,440
Endeavor to obtain the good officers of the Soviet Union

337
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,200
in ending the war short of unconditional surrender."

338
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,840
And this is the general pattern of communication that went on between the two.

339
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,400
Togo asked Sato to do the impossible.

340
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
Sato attempted to explain that it was impossible.

341
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,880
Togo told him to shut up, shut your face, just do it anyway, please.

342
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,600
Thank you.

343
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,240
And it's worth noting here that the Allies had cracked the Japanese communication codes

344
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,560
and were freely reading Japan's messages,

345
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,040
so they were privy to all of this information,

346
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,520
as well as Togo and Sato's back-and-forth comedy routine they were working on.

347
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,400
Now, militarily, the strategy of the Supreme Council

348
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,520
was just as ill-fated as their diplomatic efforts.

349
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,560
Expecting the opposing side to lose their nerve and call it quits faster than you

350
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,760
when it's your territory being invaded and occupied is quite a risky strategy.

351
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,840
It's also a strategy that hinges on the enemy first doing something that you expect them to do,

352
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,480
that being here to invade Japan at all.

353
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,400
An Allied invasion of Japan was not guaranteed to happen.

354
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,080
The United States was working on plans to possibly invade Japan

355
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,440
should it be necessary,

356
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,680
but we should not make the mistake of thinking that because an invasion was being planned for

357
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,440
that it was an inevitability.

358
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,120
President Truman wrote in his diary on the 17th of June,

359
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,200
shall we invade Japan proper or shall we bomb and blockade?

360
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,040
And this is before the Trinity test,

361
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,480
before Truman knows that he has nuclear bombs to work with

362
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
or the effectiveness of those nuclear bombs.

363
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,160
Before that, he's presenting an invasion as only one possible way forward.

364
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,240
At the start of the video, I quoted several US military leaders

365
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,480
who thought Japan would have surrendered prior to an invasion being necessary,

366
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,120
regardless of the use of nuclear bombs.

367
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
For example, Admiral Leahy, who described Japan as

368
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,200
already defeated and ready to surrender.

369
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,160
But just how defeated was Japan?

370
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,760
Let's briefly talk about the state of the Japanese military.

371
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,480
So firstly, by the middle of 1945, the Japanese Navy was virtually non-existent.

372
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,800
Every Japanese aircraft carrier had been either sunk or disabled,

373
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,120
hundreds of warships had been destroyed,

374
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,080
and after the United States captured Okinawa,

375
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
Japan's few remaining battleships were either decommissioned

376
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,720
or used as stationary anti-aircraft platforms

377
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,000
because Japan simply lacked the fuel to keep them moving.

378
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,720
Outside of suicide attacks by small vessels,

379
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,920
the Japanese Navy had ceased to exist,

380
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,560
and that's not a rhetorical flourish by me there,

381
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,320
that's a quote from the US summary report of the Pacific War.

382
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,880
In the air, Japan was faring no better.

383
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,400
There was a shortage of bombers, fighters, trained pilots,

384
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,440
materials to construct aircraft out of, and fuel to keep them in the air.

385
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,840
As you'll probably be aware, by the end of the war,

386
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,720
Japan was resorting to suicide missions carried out by poorly trained pilots

387
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,480
instructed to simply crash their planes into enemy ships.

388
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,440
Due in part to the rushed training of the pilots

389
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,040
and the increasingly poor construction of the aircraft they were flying,

390
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,720
fewer than a fifth of these planes actually hit their targets.

391
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,120
On the other side, the United States Air Force

392
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,880
was conducting constant bombing raids on targets inside Japan,

393
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,960
basically as it pleased, meeting little to no resistance in the air.

394
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,760
General Curtis LeMay, the man in charge of America's air offensive against Japan,

395
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,040
later claimed that he did not lose a single B-29 bomber to Japanese fighters.

396
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,200
And to quote the strategic bombing survey I mentioned near the start of the video,

397
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,000
United States planes crisscrossed the skies

398
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,160
with no effective Japanese air or anti-aircraft opposition.

399
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,880
Given its collapse both in the air and at sea,

400
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,080
a naval blockade was able to be put in place around Japan,

401
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,400
which firstly was absolutely devastating for the Japanese economy.

402
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,760
Almost their entire merchant fleet was picked off and destroyed,

403
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,680
and imports of vital resources like coal, crude oil, iron ore, and rubber stopped.

404
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,520
As a result, many Japanese ports, such as the one at Hiroshima, simply ceased to operate.

405
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,640
The blockade also had the effect of dramatically reducing

406
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,880
the scattered Japanese ground forces' ability to communicate, resupply, and redeploy.

407
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,720
Without their navy, Japan's troops were increasingly under-supplied

408
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,360
as well as stranded wherever they happened to be.

409
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,680
So, given the absolutely dismal state of the Japanese military situation,

410
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,320
it is presumptuous of the Supreme Council to assume

411
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,560
that the United States had to commit to a costly ground invasion at all.

412
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,920
The Americans could, if they wanted to, simply maintain their naval blockade and bombing campaign,

413
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,360
and there would be very little that the Japanese leadership could do about it.

414
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,120
They were counting on the United States first launching an invasion,

415
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,440
and only then losing faith in it.

416
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,720
Of course, another possibility is that the United States could decide

417
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,720
they didn't want to do a ground invasion before they'd started one,

418
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,960
which is, of course, what happened, but we're getting a little ahead of ourselves there.

419
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,280
Now, it is clear from their awful, unsalvageable military situation

420
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,760
that Japan's leaders should have surrendered much sooner than they did,

421
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
and indeed, some wanted to,

422
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,600
but so long as the hardline militarist faction in the Supreme Council insisted on continuing the war,

423
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,440
there was little that those who desired peace could do about it.

424
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,200
Directly, anyway.

425
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,240
Behind the scenes, members of the Japanese leadership

426
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,600
who realized that the war needed to be finished were working on plans to that end,

427
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,680
but we'll get to those in due time.

428
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,280
For now, though, the Supreme Council remained deadlocked,

429
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,480
and the terribly sad thing about all this is that while the leadership of Japan waited uselessly

430
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,520
for either an American ground invasion or rescue from the Soviet Union,

431
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,920
their civilian population centers were being systematically destroyed.

432
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,320
And here we need to introduce the concept of strategic bombing,

433
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,440
that being the intentional targeting of enemy cities with area bombing raids

434
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,520
with the aim of destroying the enemy's morale and industry.

435
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,600
Now, strategic bombing is interesting in that its name changes depending on who is doing it to whom.

436
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,160
When we're doing it to them, it's called strategic or morale bombing,

437
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,360
and it's a calculated, emotionless tactic intended to bring a swift end to the war

438
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,360
by breaking enemy morale and disrupting their war industry.

439
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,680
When they're doing it to us, on the other hand, it's called terror bombing,

440
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,400
and it's a cowardly, despicable tactic intended to instill fear in the population

441
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,840
by the ruthless slaughter of innocent women and children.

442
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,400
It all depends on your point of view, really.

443
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,520
The strategy of indiscriminate area bombing had been used prior to World War II,

444
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,640
but it was during the war that it really got up to speed.

445
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,440
The Nazis were targeting civilians with bombs from the very start of the war,

446
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,800
and notably one of the aims of their Blitz bombing campaign against cities in the United Kingdom

447
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,160
was to break the morale of the British civilian population.

448
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,920
The British Royal Air Force began the war favoring precision,

449
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,040
tactical bombing strikes against specific targets,

450
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,400
but they soon got with the times and adopted an area bombing strategy against German cities,

451
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,960
one of the aims of which was to break the morale of the German civilian population.

452
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,560
And there were two main branches of thinking behind making civilians the target of bombing raids.

453
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,400
There's the material reasoning and the psychological reasoning,

454
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,440
and we'll talk about the material reasoning first.

455
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,760
So, why spend time and resources trying to exclusively bomb small, mobile military targets

456
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,280
that can fight back when you can just fly behind those targets

457
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,800
and bomb the factories and shipyards that are producing them?

458
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,840
And those factories and shipyards supplying the military,

459
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,160
they're staffed by civilians who usually live in nearby houses.

460
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,640
They're also culpable to some degree for keeping the war machine going, right?

461
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,280
And if we bomb them, there will be fewer workers to work at those factories,

462
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,160
and therefore will reduce the enemy country's production and end the war quicker.

463
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,200
So it's not that we want to bomb civilians, you see,

464
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,200
it's simply that we think this will be less painful in the long run.

465
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,800
Now, cities aren't solely comprised of war factories and worker housing, of course.

466
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,960
But all the other things in the city,

467
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,400
the non-military industries that keep those workers alive,

468
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,520
the hospitals that heal them when they're sick and injured,

469
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,320
the schools that educate their children,

470
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,760
all these things are connected in varying degrees

471
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,440
to the functioning of that society's capacity for war.

472
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,680
So, following this logic, you can just bomb everything

473
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,160
by, in effect, reclassifying everything in the city as a military target.

474
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,000
Once you've done this, bombing civilians is impossible,

475
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
because there are no civilians.

476
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,360
The city is just one big military installation.

477
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,800
Now, it is worth noting here that the United States did not enter the war with this mindset.

478
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,640
In 1939, President Roosevelt sent an appeal to

479
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,720
refrain from air bombing of civilians to various countries,

480
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,160
and that reads as follows.

481
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,040
"...the ruthless bombing from the air of civilians in unfortified centers of population

482
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,040
during the course of hostilities which have raged in various quarters of the earth

483
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,960
during the past few years, which has resulted in the maiming and in the death

484
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,080
of thousands of defenseless men, women and children,

485
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,600
has sickened the hearts of every civilized man and woman

486
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,880
and has profoundly shocked the conscience of humanity."

487
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,400
If resort is had to this form of inhuman barbarism

488
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,040
during the period of the tragic conflagration with which the world is now confronted,

489
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,280
hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings who have no responsibility for,

490
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,080
and who are not even remotely participating in,

491
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,920
the hostilities which have now broken out, will lose their lives.

492
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,360
"...I am therefore addressing this urgent appeal to every government

493
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,680
which may be engaged in hostilities publicly to affirm its determination

494
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,800
that its armed forces shall in no event and under no circumstances

495
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,040
undertake the bombardment from the air of civilian populations."

496
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,400
So, some very high-minded words from a leader not yet in the war there.

497
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,840
A few years later, however, the United States was in the war

498
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,280
and its military leaders saw things a little differently.

499
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,680
And to quote General Curtis LeMay,

500
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,920
"...there are no innocent civilians.

501
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,720
It is their government and you are fighting a people.

502
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,520
You are not trying to fight an armed force anymore,

503
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,880
so it doesn't bother me so much to be killing the so-called innocent bystanders."

504
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,200
LeMay's bombing strategy proceeded exactly as if he rarely believed

505
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,920
there were no innocent civilians in Japan.

506
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,640
Once Allied bombers were able to reach Japan,

507
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
mass fire bombings of Japanese population centers began,

508
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,680
killing and displacing hundreds of thousands of civilians.

509
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,640
The fire bombing of Tokyo on the 9th and 10th of March

510
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,800
killed an estimated 100,000 people by itself and made a million more homeless.

511
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,720
So, in the course of just a few years,

512
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,880
the bombing of innocent civilians went from inhuman barbarism

513
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,520
to there are no innocent civilians.

514
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,800
Civilians were just another military asset to be bombed

515
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,520
as far as the Allied air force was concerned.

516
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,400
Now, the other line of reasoning for strategic bombing

517
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,720
was the possible psychological effects

518
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,160
that would result from the bombing of civilian population centers.

519
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,080
Those being that perhaps the population would lose faith in their government

520
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,880
or the soldiers on the front lines would be demoralized

521
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,920
by their families and homes being bombed while they were away,

522
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,200
and all this would therefore lead to an increased likelihood for the enemy to surrender.

523
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,680
And the material reasoning for the bombing

524
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,960
was often used merely as a pretext for this actual psychological aim.

525
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,360
Winston Churchill let this slip in a memo he drafted on the 28th of March

526
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,560
in which he addresses the controversial bombing of Dresden

527
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,560
which took place between the 13th and 15th of February.

528
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,880
In this memo, Churchill says,

529
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,960
"...it seems to me that the moment has come

530
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,520
when the question of bombing of German cities

531
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,560
simply for the sake of increasing the terror,

532
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,160
though under other pretexts, should be reviewed.

533
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,000
Otherwise, we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land.

534
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,640
The foreign secretary has spoken to me on this subject

535
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,720
and I feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives

536
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,480
such as oil and communications behind the immediate battle zone

537
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,520
rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive."

538
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,240
So, bombing simply for the sake of increasing the terror,

539
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,560
though under other pretexts.

540
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,360
So you're bombing civilians to break enemy morale

541
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,680
and if anyone gets squeamish about that, you say,

542
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,120
oh, don't worry, I know we hit a few schools and hospitals there

543
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,400
but we were actually aiming at that factory a few streets over

544
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,360
that makes boots for the army or something.

545
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,240
Every city had something or other in it that supported the armed forces in some way,

546
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,000
and thus there was always a handy excuse for indiscriminately area bombing anywhere.

547
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,480
Now this strategy is, and was at the time, very controversial,

548
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
not just from a moral standpoint,

549
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,440
I mean, that's obvious, you're blowing up innocent people,

550
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,720
but it was also controversial in terms of its effectiveness.

551
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,360
And first let's talk about the effectiveness of area bombing's material goals.

552
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,760
Firstly, even with the enormous amount of bombs which were dropped on Nazi Germany,

553
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,440
the country's production actually increased throughout the war.

554
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,120
And this happened for a few reasons,

555
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,480
one of which was that Nazi Germany used millions of people as slave labor.

556
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,760
Many German factories were staffed by prisoners.

557
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,600
When you're a fascist regime occupying whole other countries,

558
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,440
lives are very cheap.

559
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,560
Also, whatever damage was done to German industry

560
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,200
during indiscriminate area bombing raids on cities was relatively minor,

561
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,240
because, to quote the Strategic Bombing Survey,

562
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,920
Now you could say Nazi Germany's production would have increased further

563
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,840
without the area bombings, of course,

564
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,400
but we're not talking about reducing production,

565
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,000
then we're talking about slowing down the increase of production,

566
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,160
which is less likely to be a major contributing factor to a surrender.

567
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,200
We also have to consider here that while your air force is bombing civilian housing

568
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,280
with the aim of breaking their morale,

569
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,040
they're not bombing other things which it might be more useful to bomb.

570
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,800
The Strategic Bombing Survey concludes that Allied bombing raids on,

571
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,200
for instance, the Nazis oil refineries and transportation network,

572
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,680
were key to hastening the end of the war.

573
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,000
In particular, it calls the targeting of Germany's railways and waterways

574
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,400
the decisive blow that completely disorganized the German economy.

575
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,760
It also concludes that the importance of careful selection of targets for air attack

576
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,480
is emphasized by the German experience.

577
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,840
The Germans were far more concerned over attacks on one or more

578
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,400
of their basic industries and services,

579
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,640
their oil, chemical, or steel industries,

580
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,120
or their power or transportation network,

581
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,920
than they were over attacks on their armament industry or the city areas.

582
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,680
So the specific targeting of key industries and transport networks

583
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,720
was more effective than indiscriminate area bombing

584
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,760
and the destruction of civilian housing, basically.

585
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,680
Next, let's talk about the psychological effectiveness of area bombing.

586
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,320
The thinking that area bombing would lead to a surrender caused by a breakdown in morale

587
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,240
turned out to have a few flaws.

588
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
Firstly, on the government end,

589
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,160
militaristic, totalitarian, fascist regimes

590
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,080
don't care about the opinions or well-being of their civilians.

591
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,160
So they're not likely to throw in the towel

592
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,640
just because lots of ordinary people are getting killed or injured or made homeless.

593
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,160
They don't care about that.

594
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,560
Caring about people is not high on the list of priorities for totalitarian fascist regimes.

595
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,040
On the civilian end, there's several reasons

596
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,800
why trying to break their morale didn't lead to the end of the war.

597
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,000
You know, beyond their government's not caring what they think.

598
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,240
Firstly, as much as people might be terrorized by indiscriminate bombing raids,

599
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,000
they were also already being terrorized by their own governments

600
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and the police force of those governments.

601
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,080
It's one thing to have your morale shaken

602
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,720
and decide things would be better if Hitler was gone,

603
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,600
and it's another thing to translate that into action and go and fight the Gestapo.

604
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,440
Someone might not like having their city bombed and their house burnt down,

605
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,840
but that doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna go out

606
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,200
and rebel against the government and risk being executed.

607
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,120
This is Arthur Harris, perhaps better known as Bomber Harris,

608
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,920
who was the commander-in-chief of RAF Bomber Command

609
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,000
during the height of the Second World War,

610
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,560
and he oversaw the United Kingdom's area bombing campaign against German cities,

611
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,640
including the bombing of Dresden.

612
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,440
Now, as you might be able to tell from his nickname,

613
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,760
Bomber Harris was a very enthusiastic supporter of area bombing,

614
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,640
and he was also a very enthusiastic supporter

615
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,920
of being honest about the point of area bombing.

616
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,200
And let's read a quote of his from 1943.

617
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,840
"...the aim of the combined bomber offensive should be unambiguously stated

618
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,600
as the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers,

619
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,560
and the disruption of civilized life throughout Germany.

620
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,960
The destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives,

621
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,480
the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale,

622
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,840
and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battlefronts

623
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,040
by fear of extended and intensified bombing

624
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,880
are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy.

625
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,800
They are not byproducts of attempts to hit factories."

626
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,960
So when he said this, he was clearly in favor of area bombing as a tactic,

627
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,560
and also in favor of being honest about the aim of it.

628
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,760
The point was to disrupt civilian life, kill people, and spread fear.

629
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,160
However, after the war, Bomber Harris changed his mind.

630
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,680
In his 1947 book, Bomber Offensive,

631
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,920
Harris writes that while in 1941 it had seemed like a good idea

632
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,640
to use area bombing to break the enemy's morale,

633
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,240
in the long run it proved to be wholly unsound.

634
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,200
And I quote,

635
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,360
"...when we had destroyed almost all the larger industrial cities in Germany,

636
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,080
the civil population remained apathetic,

637
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,800
while the Gestapo saw to it that they were docile,

638
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,720
and insofar as there was work left for them to do, industrious."

639
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,200
Morale bombing was comparatively ineffective

640
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,400
against so well organized a police state as Germany.

641
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,120
The German leaders themselves admitted after the war

642
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,240
that morale was bad after our attacks on their towns,

643
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,720
but they distinguished between the morale and the conduct of the workers.

644
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,520
Conduct, they say, was unaffected.

645
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,120
In other words, there was nothing unarmed Germans could do about it

646
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:56,240
with the Gestapo standing by and with the concentration camp round the corner.

647
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,200
So that's the failure of morale bombing

648
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,560
from someone who was previously both very in favor of it

649
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,200
and directly responsible for it there.

650
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,360
And the Strategic Bombing Survey also covers the same topic, saying,

651
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,000
"...if they," that's the German civilians,

652
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,880
"...had been at liberty to vote themselves out of the war,

653
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,000
they would have done so well before the final surrender.

654
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,320
In a determined police state, however,

655
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,520
there is a wide difference between dissatisfaction and expressed opposition."

656
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,280
About the nicest thing you can say about this morale bombing idea

657
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,920
is that some people apparently thought it might work, but it didn't.

658
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,720
And it just so happens that in the course of it not working,

659
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,280
it pointlessly killed, injured, and displaced

660
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,760
a very large number of innocent civilians.

661
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,480
Attempts to break the morale of the German citizenry

662
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,440
with terror bombing tactics led to apathy, not revolutionary action.

663
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,480
And not to get too armchair general on you all here,

664
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,200
but I don't mind concluding that every single bomb that was dropped on a German house

665
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,760
would have been better put to use if it was dropped instead on a German railway line

666
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,040
or something else of actual military significance.

667
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,800
However, I would like to make clear here that by no means am I saying

668
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,840
we should absolve the entire German citizenry of all fault in the Second World War.

669
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,560
Many civilians were, of course, committed supporters of the Nazi Party

670
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,920
and often participants in its various crimes.

671
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,800
When I say innocent civilians, I absolutely do not mean those people.

672
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,840
However, many German citizens were innocent,

673
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,560
many were persecuted by the Nazis themselves,

674
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,800
or many were children, for instance,

675
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,400
and sadly, indiscriminate area bombing does not discern between these groups of people.

676
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,880
Now, all this is important for us today

677
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,160
because the manner in which the atomic bombs were targeted and used

678
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,240
was merely an extension of this morale bombing philosophy.

679
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,320
So let's talk a little about that.

680
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,800
In the months before the atomic bomb was used,

681
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,960
a group of scientists and military personnel dubbed the Target Committee

682
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,760
was established by director of the Manhattan Project, General Leslie Groves,

683
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,160
and this group met several times to discuss how the bombs should be used.

684
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,040
And the minutes of the meetings of the Target Committee

685
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,160
give us an insight into the thinking behind the target selection for the bombs.

686
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,240
On the 10th of May, the group met in the office of J. Robert Oppenheimer,

687
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,800
who was the head of the laboratory that designed the bombs

688
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,440
and one of the scientists on the committee.

689
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,960
And they discussed various points relating to how the bomb should be used.

690
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,000
One key point for us here is the section

691
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,040
Psychological Factors in Target Selection, and that reads as follows.

692
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,880
It was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance.

693
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,400
Two aspects of this are one, obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan,

694
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,880
and two, making the initial use sufficiently spectacular

695
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,320
for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized

696
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,800
when publicity on it is released.

697
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,920
So when picking targets here, they're not just thinking

698
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,360
about the psychological effects upon the inhabitants of Japan,

699
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,320
they're also already thinking about the effects the bomb will have outside of the war.

700
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,920
They want the bomb to be sufficiently spectacular,

701
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,120
like they're setting off a big firework or something.

702
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,400
Furthermore, still under the psychological factors heading regarding Hiroshima,

703
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,880
it was put forward that Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size

704
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,000
and with possible focusing from nearby mountains

705
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,320
that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed.

706
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,560
That's an advantage, remember.

707
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,880
So in picking Hiroshima as a target, they were aiming to destroy a large fraction of the city

708
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,880
due specifically to the associated psychological factors.

709
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,720
Reading these minutes, it is clear that the members of the target committee

710
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,240
were much more focused on the psychological effects of the bomb

711
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,040
than its practical physical effects upon Japan's military capabilities.

712
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,800
Regarding this, they write,

713
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,600
Use against military objectives. Nice use of quotation marks there.

714
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,320
It was agreed that for the initial use of the weapon,

715
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,920
any small and strictly military objective should be located in a much larger area

716
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,600
subject to blast damage in order to avoid undue risks

717
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,360
of the weapon being lost due to bad placing of the bomb.

718
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,280
So they didn't want to bomb an isolated, strictly military target

719
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,080
for fear of missing and losing the weapon.

720
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
Whereas if they drop the bomb on a city,

721
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,920
missing their air quotes, military target is just fine

722
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,760
because a large fraction of the city will still be destroyed regardless

723
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,720
and therefore the bomb will still convey the very important psychological effects.

724
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,680
Now, I don't know any way of reading this other than

725
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,280
it's okay if we don't actually hit a military objective

726
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,520
so long as we still hit a city.

727
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,200
Actual material effects upon Japan's military capabilities

728
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,000
were clearly not of prime importance here.

729
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,520
It is very telling that the top of their target list was Kyoto,

730
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,320
the former capital of Japan, which was of relatively little military significance

731
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,280
but enormous psychological importance.

732
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,360
They also include the ludicrous reasoning that since Kyoto is an intellectual center for Japan,

733
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,320
the people there are more apt to appreciate the significance of such a weapon,

734
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,720
as if the inhabitants of the other cities of Japan would be simply too unintelligent

735
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,040
to understand the significance of their city being exploded.

736
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,800
In the end, of course, Kyoto was not hit with an atomic bomb.

737
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,160
General Leslie Groves wanted very much to bomb Kyoto,

738
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,480
but after a lot of stalling, it was reluctantly taken off the list of targets

739
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,200
on the persistent and repeated orders of Secretary of War Henry Stimson,

740
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,800
who, and yes, this is the actual reason, once went there on holiday.

741
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,160
At a meeting of the Interim Committee on the 31st of May,

742
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,840
Stimson described Kyoto as exclusively a place of homes and art and shrines,

743
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,560
and argued it must not be bombed.

744
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,800
The minutes of this meeting on the 31st of May reveal the confusing

745
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,720
and contradictory list of requirements for the bomb targets.

746
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,480
And let's read a little from the section

747
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,320
Effect of the Bombing on the Japanese and Their Will to Fight.

748
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,200
After much discussion concerning various types of targets and the effects to be produced,

749
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,280
the Secretary expressed the conclusion, on which there was general agreement,

750
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,000
that we could not give the Japanese any warning,

751
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,960
that we could not concentrate on a civilian area,

752
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,560
but that we should seek to make a profound psychological impression

753
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,200
on as many of the inhabitants as possible.

754
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,600
Now, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

755
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,760
If you aren't concentrating upon a civilian area,

756
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,200
how do you make a profound psychological impression upon as many inhabitants as possible?

757
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,800
It's not going to make much of an impression on the Japanese population

758
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,000
if you drop the bomb on some isolated military target somewhere where no one will see it.

759
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,280
It would just be one more thing that got bombed that day.

760
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,080
This was brought up in the meeting when someone, quote,

761
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,960
"...pointed out that one atomic bomb dropped on an arsenal

762
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,160
would not be much different from the effect caused by any air core strike of present dimensions.

763
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,080
However, Dr. Oppenheimer stated that the visual effect of an atomic bombing would be tremendous.

764
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,720
It would be accompanied by a brilliant luminescence,

765
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,080
which would rise to a height of 10,000 to 20,000 feet."

766
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,160
So that's the key thing here that's supposed to differentiate the nuclear bombs

767
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,000
from the conventional bombing raids.

768
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,240
It's not the material effect upon Japanese military capabilities,

769
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,080
it's how impressive they look.

770
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,760
Now, of course, if you want to create a profound psychological effect

771
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,160
with your big, impressive-looking bomb,

772
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,200
you need to drop it somewhere where people can see it.

773
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,800
So how do you drop the bomb on a strictly military target

774
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,080
while ensuring there are lots of Japanese inhabitants around to see how tremendous it is?

775
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,720
The members of the meeting wriggled their way out of this conundrum with the following euphemism.

776
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,280
The most desirable target would be a vital war plant employing a large number of workers

777
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,480
and closely surrounded by workers' houses.

778
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,000
So we're not bombing a civilian area, to be clear.

779
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,560
We are not aiming at houses.

780
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,040
We're aiming at a factory closely surrounded by houses.

781
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,680
And if we happen to miss the factory, that's okay.

782
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,560
We won't lose the bomb because it will still destroy a large fraction of the city, remember.

783
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,400
But again, we're not targeting the civilians, we promise.

784
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,080
What a load of rubbish, honestly.

785
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,640
They want to bomb civilians, they have decided to bomb civilians,

786
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,240
and they know it, but they're too cowardly to admit it.

787
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,960
So they're pretending the desired effects of the bomb

788
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,800
will merely be the byproduct of an attempt to hit a factory, as Bomber Harris put it.

789
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,560
Now Secretary Stimpson went along with this ridiculous euphemism,

790
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,640
or at least contented himself with having saved his pet city of Kyoto.

791
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,560
The other target cities were placed on a no bomb list,

792
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,360
meaning that they were not to be targeted by the Air Force

793
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,520
with conventional bombings prior to being hit with the atomic bombs.

794
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,440
This was because another desired attribute of the potential bomb targets

795
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,880
was that they were, as far as possible, undamaged,

796
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,360
so as to better demonstrate the destructive power of the atomic bomb.

797
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,880
They want a spectacular show, after all.

798
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,000
Now this requirement speaks to the relative military

799
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,600
unimportance of the cities that ended up making the list.

800
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:37,120
They were thus far undamaged, in part because they were not high-priority military targets.

801
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,120
This is something for us to keep in mind

802
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,160
when considering those justifications for the atomic bombs

803
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,040
that highlight whatever military industry existed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

804
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,000
Because whatever military industry existed in those cities

805
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,440
did so specifically because they were not being attacked,

806
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,560
initially because of the city's relative unimportance

807
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,040
compared with higher value bombing targets,

808
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,320
and following that because they were on this no bomb list.

809
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:07,040
Allied bombers had attacked dozens of Japanese cities with conventional weapons.

810
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,760
Tokyo was extensively firebombed months before the atomic bombs were dropped.

811
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,320
There was nothing stopping Allied bombers from also attacking the list of target cities

812
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,000
if they were supposed to be so important to Japan's military efforts,

813
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,520
except for the fact that they were being preserved, on purpose,

814
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,840
to be destroyed with atomic bombs.

815
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,080
Now, of course, before the bomb was used in the field, it was first tested.

816
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:35,120
And the timing of the first nuclear test detonation, codenamed the Trinity Test,

817
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,600
caused a problem for President Truman,

818
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,240
as the upcoming Potsdam Conference in Germany

819
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,200
meant that he personally would be out of the country.

820
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,160
Truman actually wanted to delay the Potsdam Conference

821
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,640
until a little while after the Trinity Test,

822
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,640
so that he would know, going into diplomatic negotiations there,

823
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,440
whether or not he had the nuclear bombs to play with.

824
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,840
But he had to settle for getting the news while he was at the conference.

825
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,640
Now, before we get into talking about the Potsdam Conference,

826
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,240
I'd just like to recap what our principal actors are up to here.

827
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,840
So, Truman was stating his intent to get Russia to commit to the Japanese war,

828
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,160
and he later wrote that it was his main objective in going to Potsdam.

829
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,440
The Soviet Union was ignoring Japan's peace feelers

830
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,320
and, per the secret agreement they made at Yalta,

831
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,840
preparing to void the non-aggression pact they had with Japan and invade Manchuria.

832
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,440
Japan was organizing a diplomatic mission to travel to Moscow

833
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,200
and meet with Stalin directly,

834
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,280
in order to hopefully convince him to negotiate an end to the war.

835
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,120
This diplomatic mission was led by Prince Fumimaro Konoe.

836
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,280
Now, Konoe was a prestigious politician and former prime minister

837
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,360
who, prior to the war, had advised against attacking America.

838
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,440
He thought Pearl Harbor was a mistake,

839
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,560
and he was very critical of the hardline militarists,

840
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,480
stating in a report to the Emperor in February of 1945

841
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,480
that they were the greatest obstacle to a termination of the conflict,

842
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,800
and that, even though they knew they would lose,

843
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,760
they are likely to continue fighting to the very end,

844
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,520
merely to save face.

845
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,280
So, the selection of this chap to head the diplomatic mission to Russia

846
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,280
sends a clear message here.

847
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,760
The Emperor wants the war over,

848
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,520
and he wants to send Konoe to talk to Stalin to get it done.

849
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,680
To prepare for the arrival of this mission,

850
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,680
Togo messaged Sato to set up a meeting between Konoe and Stalin,

851
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,800
and sent ahead the text of a message from the Emperor himself

852
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,960
that Konoe was to bring with him.

853
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,280
And this message reads as follows.

854
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,960
"'His Majesty the Emperor,

855
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,600
mindful of the fact that the present war daily brings greater evil and sacrifice

856
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,080
upon the peoples of all the belligerent powers,

857
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,240
desires from his heart that it may be quickly terminated.

858
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,800
But so long as England and the United States

859
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,880
insist upon unconditional surrender,

860
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,280
the Japanese Empire has no alternative but to fight on with all its strength

861
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,080
for the honor and existence of the Motherland.'"

862
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,160
Now, Stalin got this message, but made no immediate response.

863
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,960
He, too, was heading to the Potsdam Conference,

864
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,360
and that's what we're going to talk about next.

865
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,360
So, the Potsdam Conference took place

866
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,800
between the 17th of July and the 2nd of August.

867
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,360
Now, this conference was similar to the Yalta Conference

868
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,400
in that it was a meeting of the leaders of the Soviet Union,

869
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,560
United Kingdom, and United States

870
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:27,120
to discuss various matters related to the post-war organization of Europe.

871
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,840
However, in the time between the two conferences,

872
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,320
a few important things had changed.

873
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,840
Firstly, as we've mentioned,

874
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,800
the US President and Secretary of State had changed,

875
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,080
and Truman and Burns wanted a harder line on Russia.

876
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,160
We don't need to get too deep into it here,

877
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,400
but negotiations with the Soviet Union

878
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,960
regarding various matters related to Europe

879
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,120
had become increasingly difficult.

880
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,840
Plus, the Nazis were out of the war by now,

881
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,640
which meant there was less incentive for the other Allies

882
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,040
to concede to Stalin's demands.

883
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,280
Another important change was the completion of the Nuclear Bomb Project.

884
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,680
The Trinity Test was conducted early in the morning on the 16th of July,

885
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,240
just prior to the Potsdam Conference,

886
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,920
and the test was a success.

887
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,560
The Manhattan Project scientists demonstrated

888
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,280
that they could detonate a nuclear bomb.

889
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,600
Now, though the leadership of the United States

890
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,200
had intended to get the Soviet Union into the war against Japan,

891
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,720
all the things we just mentioned

892
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,920
contributed to an important shift in opinion on that issue

893
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,160
that was going on behind the scenes.

894
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,920
And two diary entries written by President Truman at Potsdam

895
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,320
make clear this shift in opinion.

896
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,720
The first comes on the 17th of July,

897
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,360
when Truman met Stalin for the first time,

898
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,200
and they discussed various matters,

899
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,920
including Russia's entry into the war against Japan.

900
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,200
Truman's diary account of the conversation reports

901
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,560
that Stalin will, quote,

902
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,080
"...be in the Japanese War on August 15th."

903
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,200
Finny the Japanese when that comes about,

904
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,880
although Truman uses a free letter shorthand for Japanese

905
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,480
that I won't repeat here on account of it being a racial slur.

906
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,320
So the indication from this diary entry on the 17th of July

907
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,080
is that Truman thinks that Japan is close to being finished off,

908
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,560
and that Soviet entry into the war is what is going to do it.

909
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,920
And he furthermore wrote a letter to his wife while at Potsdam,

910
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,560
stating, "...I had gotten what I came for.

911
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,640
Stalin goes to war on August 15th with no strings on it."

912
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,240
And he goes on to mention how this means he thinks the war will be shorter

913
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,960
and fewer lives will be lost as a result.

914
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,000
So Truman seems positively enthusiastic about Soviet entry into the war right here,

915
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,320
and it is interesting to note that Truman's belief

916
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,840
that Japan will be finished off by a Soviet declaration of war

917
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,960
means that he already thinks a US invasion of Japan is unnecessary.

918
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,760
The second entry into Truman's diary I want to talk about comes the very next day.

919
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,360
Now, Truman had been informed of the success of the Trinity test already on the 16th of July,

920
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,560
but it's here on the 18th that he first gets an indication

921
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,280
of just how powerful the atomic bomb was.

922
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,040
Henry Stimson received a coded message describing an explosion

923
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,520
that could be seen for hundreds of miles,

924
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,400
and he relayed this to Truman, who he described as

925
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,120
"...greatly reinforced and highly delighted upon hearing the news."

926
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,280
And writing in this diary on this day, Truman says the following,

927
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,360
"...believed the Japanese will fold up before Russia comes in.

928
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,240
I am sure they will when Manhattan appears over their homeland."

929
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,280
So here, Truman is presenting the bombs as an event that will preempt a Russian invasion

930
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,040
as the thing that will cause the Japanese to fold up.

931
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,600
This was an opinion shared by James Burns,

932
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,760
who later wrote in his memoirs that, during the Potsdam Conference, quote,

933
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,920
"...I would have been satisfied had the Russians determined not to enter the war.

934
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,200
Notwithstanding Japan's persistent refusal to surrender,

935
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,000
I believed the atomic bomb would be successful

936
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,680
and would force the Japanese to accept surrender on our terms.

937
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,480
I feared what would happen when the Red Army entered Manchuria."

938
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,280
James Burns also rather candidly admitted in a post-war interview that, quote,

939
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,640
"...it was ever-present in my mind that it was important

940
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,840
that we have an end to the war before the Russians came in.

941
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,760
Neither the president nor I were anxious to have them enter the war

942
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,560
after we'd learned of this successful test."

943
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,200
So here, Burns is directly tying the desire to keep the Russians out of the war

944
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,840
to the news coming in from the Trinity test.

945
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,680
And Walter Brown, who was assistant to James Burns at Potsdam,

946
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,320
wrote in his diary on the 24th of July

947
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,160
that Burns told him he believed that, after the atomic bomb was dropped,

948
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,280
Japan will surrender and Russia will not get in so much on the kill.

949
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,960
So the plan was to get Russia to invade Manchuria,

950
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,280
something that would likely finish the war.

951
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,680
But finishing the war with Russia's help

952
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,480
does mean having to deal with Stalin being at the negotiating table afterwards.

953
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,320
And given the difficulty of how the European negotiations are going,

954
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,800
and how Roosevelt, God rest his soul,

955
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,640
has already gone and promised Stalin a bunch of concessions for helping out,

956
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,360
maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing

957
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,960
if Russia ended up not being necessary here after all.

958
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,840
And since the Trinity test was just a big success,

959
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,520
we now have these very destructive nuclear bombs to play with.

960
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,680
And maybe when we use these,

961
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,120
Japan might surrender, to us specifically,

962
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,680
before Russia even declares war.

963
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,840
And wouldn't that be handy?

964
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:36,560
And I'd like to point out two more things about this diary entry on July the 18th.

965
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,160
The first is that Truman writes

966
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,400
he believes the Japanese will fold up before Russia comes in.

967
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,520
He does not write,

968
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,720
I believe the Japanese will fold up before a US invasion of Japan is necessary.

969
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,160
An invasion of Japan is already off the table here, as far as Truman is concerned.

970
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,480
Truman and Barnes are not presenting the bombs

971
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,800
as an alternative to a US invasion of Japan as a means to end the war.

972
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,120
They are presenting the bombs as an alternative

973
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,600
to a Soviet invasion of Manchuria as a means to end the war.

974
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,640
The second thing I'd like to point out about this diary entry

975
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,360
is that Truman writes the Japanese will fold up

976
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,080
when Manhattan appears over their homeland.

977
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,880
And that's when, not if.

978
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,200
Truman writes about the use of the nuclear bombs

979
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,160
as a thing that simply is going to happen,

980
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,120
and then he speculates about the effects they will have.

981
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:32,080
Nowhere here is the thought that the bombs might possibly not need to be used.

982
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,480
As Truman later states in his memoirs,

983
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,200
I regarded the bomb as a military weapon

984
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,400
and never had any doubt that it should be used.

985
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,480
And this is concerning in light of the fact that on July 18th,

986
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,960
Truman learned of the message that the Kanoe mission was to deliver to Stalin.

987
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,000
After meeting with Churchill, Truman notes in his diary

988
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,240
that Stalin had told PM, that's Prime Minister Churchill,

989
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,080
of telegram from the Japanese emperor asking for peace.

990
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,360
Stalin also read his answer to me.

991
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,280
It was satisfactory.

992
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,560
As for what Stalin's satisfactory answer was,

993
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,280
we can read this account of Admiral Leahy's of a meeting ten days later.

994
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,520
Stalin enlivened the proceedings by reporting that on July 18th,

995
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,880
he had received a request from Japan to mediate for them with the Allies to end the war.

996
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,440
He said this request included a proposal

997
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,360
to send a royal prince of Japan to Moscow as chief of the mission.

998
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:33,280
The Generalissimo said that his reply was that the proposal was too vague

999
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,480
to warrant his approving a meeting with the proposed mission.

1000
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,880
Stalin then says that he had that day received another message from Japan

1001
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,520
attempting to clarify the purpose of the mission,

1002
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,040
but that he was going to send the Japanese the same response.

1003
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,600
Leahy concludes that it was clearly evident that Stalin was at that time

1004
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,080
determined to enter the war against Japan,

1005
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:59,680
which plainly was to the advantage of Russia now that Japan was certain to be defeated.

1006
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,960
So Tokyo is sending messages to Stalin asking for him to mediate and enter the war,

1007
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,560
and he's avoiding answering them directly and instead repeatedly asking for clarifications,

1008
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,080
and he's clearly just buying time while he prepares for an invasion.

1009
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,640
More like Joseph Stalling.

1010
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,440
Anyway, to get back on track, President Truman knows at Potsdam

1011
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,240
that the Japanese leadership are, in his words, asking for peace.

1012
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,600
So given that, why, we might wonder,

1013
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:34,080
was there no doubt in Truman's mind about the need to set off nuclear bombs

1014
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,800
in the middle of civilian population centers?

1015
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:42,000
Now, we could simply say that Truman had resolved to drop the atomic bomb on civilians

1016
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,680
in order to force a Japanese surrender on favorable terms

1017
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,960
before the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria.

1018
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,320
However, this interpretation of events seemingly conflicts

1019
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,480
with another diary entry that Truman wrote on the 25th of July,

1020
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,600
when, talking about the upcoming bombings, he says,

1021
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,240
This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10th.

1022
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,120
I have told the Secretary of War, Mr. Stimson,

1023
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:12,400
to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target,

1024
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,800
and not women and children.

1025
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,560
He and I are in accord.

1026
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,760
The target will be a purely military one.

1027
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,000
So, what's going on here?

1028
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,560
Truman states in this diary entry

1029
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,560
that the bomb is going to be used against a purely military target.

1030
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,440
Now, by no stretch of the imagination

1031
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,320
can the middle of a civilian population center

1032
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,200
be considered a purely military target.

1033
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,080
It is, in fact, the exact place you would drop the bomb

1034
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,960
if you were trying to target women and children.

1035
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,480
If the middle of a city counts as a purely military target,

1036
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,560
then there is nowhere the bomb could be dropped

1037
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,360
that would not count as a purely military target,

1038
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:56,480
making the question of whether to drop it on a purely military target or not completely pointless.

1039
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,640
And he's talking to Henry Stimson,

1040
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,320
who, of course, knows the bomb is going to be dropped on a city,

1041
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,400
but has apparently tricked himself into believing the lazy euphemism

1042
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:12,320
about a war plant surrounded by workers' houses being a purely military target.

1043
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,680
Truman and Stimson are acting like the bomb is going to be dropped

1044
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,400
on a military base or an airfield or something,

1045
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,880
and then patting themselves on the back for not dropping it on civilians.

1046
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,760
For whatever reason, Truman is thinking about the bomb

1047
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,960
as though it is only going to affect enemy soldiers.

1048
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,720
He seems to understand that it would be wrong to drop the bomb on civilians,

1049
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,840
but not that that is exactly what is about to happen.

1050
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,720
As for why this is, there are three possible explanations that I can imagine.

1051
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:45,520
The first is that Truman genuinely thinks the bomb is not going to be dropped on civilians

1052
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,360
and that the target list only includes military bases or something.

1053
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,160
In this version of events, Truman is told by Stimson

1054
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,600
that the bomb is going to be dropped on a purely military target,

1055
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,800
believes him, and is later surprised by the fact the bombs have actually been dropped on civilians.

1056
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:06,240
And so he orders that no more nuclear bombs should be dropped without his express permission,

1057
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,560
which is something he did do after the second bomb was dropped, by the way.

1058
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,920
Then I guess he realizes that he's massively screwed up,

1059
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,440
but decides to just run with it and pretend that was the plan all along,

1060
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,440
because that's easier at that point than admitting the enormous incompetence

1061
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,120
and being like, sorry, I didn't actually mean to blow up two cities, that's my bad.

1062
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:31,040
The second explanation is that Truman is simply deluding himself.

1063
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:36,000
He knows exactly what the target is, but he's convincing himself it's something else.

1064
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,240
If he really thought about it, he'd know that the bomb was not going to land on a purely military target,

1065
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,440
so he's not thinking about it, and he's deceiving himself.

1066
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:50,320
The third explanation I can imagine is that Truman is just consciously lying.

1067
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,400
He knows the bomb is not going to be dropped on a purely military target,

1068
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,200
but he's falsely claiming that that is what he believes at this point in time.

1069
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,200
And I suppose this could have been done with an eye on his place in the history books,

1070
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,600
or to protect himself if there was any significant repercussions after the bombs,

1071
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,440
then he could have pointed to this and claimed,

1072
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,680
hey, I ordered them to be dropped on military targets, you can't pin this on me.

1073
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,600
All these options are just speculation on my part, however.

1074
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,920
If I was forced to guess, I'd say he was probably deceiving himself,

1075
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,040
but I do not know the actual reason why Truman wrote

1076
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,480
that the bombs were only going to be used on military targets.

1077
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,640
I only know that for whatever reason. When he wrote that, he was wrong.

1078
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,240
Now, leaving the nuclear bombs to the side for a moment,

1079
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,040
I wouldn't blame someone for asking at this point.

1080
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:44,880
If Truman and Burns are apparently so anxious to get the war over with before the Russians get involved,

1081
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,480
and they knew at Potsdam that the Emperor was asking for peace,

1082
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,560
why was peace not able to be negotiated sooner than it was?

1083
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,200
Why, when they heard the Emperor wanted peace,

1084
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,800
did they not simply send him a message saying, great, okay, let's negotiate peace?

1085
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,960
And the answer to that is the deadlock over unconditional surrender.

1086
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,760
As we know, Japan was committed to avoiding an unconditional surrender,

1087
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,120
but Truman was likewise committed to securing one.

1088
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:17,920
He didn't want to accept what the Japanese were offering, which was a negotiated peace.

1089
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,520
He wanted a full unconditional surrender.

1090
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,920
Now, various individuals within the Allied governments and armed forces

1091
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,000
understood that insisting on absolute unconditional surrender was,

1092
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,040
particularly with regards to the question of the Emperor,

1093
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,640
going to cause problems and possibly prolong the war.

1094
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,760
While at the Yalta Conference, Winston Churchill suggested that mitigating the terms of surrender,

1095
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:47,120
quote, would be worthwhile if it led to the saving of a year or a year and a half of war

1096
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,240
in which so much blood and treasure would be poured out.

1097
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,960
But President Roosevelt was unreceptive to Churchill's suggestion.

1098
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,000
Not to be deterred, however, Churchill tried again when talking to Truman at Potsdam,

1099
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,640
and he later gave an account of the conversation.

1100
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,840
I dwelt upon the tremendous cost in American life and to a smaller extent in British life,

1101
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:12,240
which would be involved in forcing unconditional surrender upon the Japanese.

1102
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,400
It was for him to consider whether this might not be expressed in some other way,

1103
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,760
so that we got all the essentials for future peace and security,

1104
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,360
and yet left the Japanese some show of saving their military honor

1105
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,160
and some assurance of their national existence.

1106
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,640
However, Churchill found this president as unreceptive as the last.

1107
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,080
Truman, quote, countered by saying that he did not think the Japanese

1108
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,800
had any military honor after Pearl Harbor.

1109
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,440
But Churchill responded that, at any rate,

1110
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,000
they had something for which they were ready to face certain death in very large numbers,

1111
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,440
and this might not be so important to us as to them.

1112
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,400
Others attempted to influence Truman on the unconditional surrender issue at various times,

1113
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,760
sometimes seemingly having more luck than Churchill there.

1114
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,400
Under Secretary of State Joseph Grew, who understood the importance of the emperor

1115
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:05,760
having been US ambassador to Japan for a decade, advised Truman on the 28th of May

1116
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,520
that the greatest obstacle to unconditional surrender by the Japanese

1117
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,000
is their belief that this would entail the destruction

1118
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,920
or permanent removal of the emperor and the institution of the throne.

1119
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,320
And Grew goes on to say that without an assurance

1120
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,800
that the imperial institution would not be destroyed,

1121
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,920
a Japanese surrender would be highly unlikely.

1122
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,840
And he further notes that the president said that he was interested in what I said

1123
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,040
because his own thoughts had been following the same line.

1124
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,000
Another of Truman's advisors who took a similar line was Secretary of War Henry Stimson,

1125
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,080
who spoke to Truman on the 2nd of July

1126
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,440
on the issue of drafting surrender terms for Japan, stating that

1127
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,800
"...I personally think that if we should add that we do not exclude

1128
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,920
a constitutional monarchy under her present dynasty,

1129
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,960
it would substantially add to the chances of acceptance."

1130
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,160
And Stimson later wrote in his diary that Truman was, quote,

1131
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:58,880
"...apparently acquiescent with my attitude towards the treatment of Japan."

1132
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,760
Now, I think there's two possibilities here.

1133
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,400
The first is that President Harry S. Truman

1134
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,880
was one of those intensely annoying people

1135
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,200
who simply agree with whatever the last person they spoke to said to them,

1136
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,560
showing absolutely no respect for future historians

1137
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,000
attempting to figure out what they actually thought about anything.

1138
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,800
The second is that Truman was actually sympathetic

1139
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,120
to what his advisors were advising him

1140
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,920
with regards to softening unconditional surrender,

1141
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,040
but there was some other influence preventing him from acting on that advice.

1142
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,960
And we perhaps see a hint of this at a meeting on the 18th of June,

1143
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,520
when this time, Admiral Leahy tried his luck

1144
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,320
at pushing for a softening of unconditional surrender,

1145
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,440
stating that "...our insistence on unconditional surrender

1146
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,320
would result only in making the Japanese desperate

1147
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,280
and thereby increase our casualty lists."

1148
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,880
And Truman responded that

1149
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,080
"...he did not feel that he could take any action at this time

1150
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,880
to change public opinion on the matter."

1151
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,880
So, the opinion of the public

1152
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,680
is being factored into the decision-making process

1153
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,000
regarding Japanese surrender terms.

1154
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,560
And I think it's fair to say that the United States public

1155
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,360
were not the biggest fans of Emperor Hirohito.

1156
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,480
A Gallup poll conducted on the 29th of June reported

1157
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,840
that when asked what the fate of the Emperor should be after the war,

1158
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,920
the most popular response was,

1159
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,200
"...execute him."

1160
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,240
So any US president with an eye on public opinion

1161
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,920
is in a bit of a tricky position

1162
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,520
when it comes to openly telling Japan they can keep their emperor,

1163
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,760
especially if said US president

1164
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,200
has a history of calling for unconditional surrender.

1165
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,000
Just about the only person not advising Truman

1166
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,720
to soften the surrender terms was James Burns,

1167
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,960
who will later rather dramatically state

1168
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,400
that Truman appearing to back down from unconditional surrender

1169
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,760
would lead to the crucifixion of the president.

1170
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,760
All of this is complicated by the fact that behind the scenes,

1171
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,840
the leadership of the Allied military

1172
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,640
did not desire to get rid of the Emperor.

1173
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,520
In fact, there was actually a pressing military reason

1174
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,040
to retain the Emperor.

1175
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,600
And to quote a meeting of the Combined Chiefs of Staff

1176
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,840
that took place on the 16th of July

1177
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,000
when discussing unconditional surrender,

1178
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,360
it was suggested that,

1179
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,320
"...if, for instance, an interpretation could be found

1180
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,160
and communicated to the Japanese

1181
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,000
which did not involve the dissolution of the Imperial Institution,

1182
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,960
the Emperor would be in a position to order the ceasefire

1183
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,240
in outlying areas,

1184
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,560
whereas if the dynasty were destroyed,

1185
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,040
the outlying garrisons might continue to fight

1186
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,960
for many months or years."

1187
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,000
So the proposal here is to leave the Emperor in place

1188
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,920
and use his influence to convince

1189
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,800
the scattered Japanese troops to stand down,

1190
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,440
whereas if they simply kill or imprison the Emperor,

1191
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,760
that might prompt the troops to fight on.

1192
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,040
So Truman's being pulled in different directions here.

1193
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,800
Strictly militarily speaking,

1194
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,520
letting Japan keep the Emperor makes a lot of sense.

1195
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,760
It will almost certainly shorten the war,

1196
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,560
save lives,

1197
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,760
and be the thing to convince the Japanese military to give up.

1198
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,800
Conveying that message to the Japanese leadership

1199
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,400
prior to their surrender, though,

1200
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,080
is potentially risky from a domestic political standpoint.

1201
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,600
If you've previously been calling for unconditional surrender,

1202
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,400
you don't want to be seen as reversing position on that

1203
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,760
and giving in to a hated enemy's demands.

1204
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,360
However, the threat of the Soviet Union's expansion into Asia

1205
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,000
means you do want to end the war quickly.

1206
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,480
So there's conflicting motivations here,

1207
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,360
and these conflicting motivations came to influence

1208
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,240
the construction of the Potsdam Declaration.

1209
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:32,320
Now, this was a statement issued by the Allies on the 26th of July

1210
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,440
that called for the unconditional surrender of Japan,

1211
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,080
saying,

1212
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,720
"...we call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now

1213
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,080
the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces

1214
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,960
and to provide proper and adequate assurances

1215
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,360
of their good faith in such action."

1216
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,360
The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction,

1217
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,280
and it laid out various terms,

1218
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,640
such as the occupation of Japanese territory by the Allies,

1219
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,040
the disarming of the Japanese military,

1220
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,000
and so on.

1221
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,120
Notably, however,

1222
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:05,280
the Potsdam Declaration did not contain any mention of the Emperor,

1223
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,120
which you might think is rather odd,

1224
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,680
given that the Allies clearly know how important

1225
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,760
the question of the Imperial Institution was to the Japanese leadership.

1226
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,280
However, it did state that

1227
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,960
"...the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled

1228
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,000
the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest

1229
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,800
must be eliminated for all time."

1230
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,040
And this is rather vague with respect to exactly who it means.

1231
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,920
Does the Emperor count as one of those who have misled the people of Japan?

1232
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,960
When the Japanese leadership received the Potsdam Declaration,

1233
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,680
the hardliners on the Supreme Council interpreted this in a very unfavorable way

1234
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,600
and took it to be an indirect threat to the Emperor's life.

1235
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,240
Another confusing point for the Japanese leadership

1236
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,800
was that when the Potsdam Declaration was issued,

1237
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,960
it was signed by the United States,

1238
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,760
Britain,

1239
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,480
China,

1240
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,400
and, interestingly,

1241
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,480
not the Soviet Union.

1242
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,520
To the Supreme Council, this inspired a question,

1243
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,520
as well as a fair bit of false hope.

1244
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,600
If the Soviet Union didn't sign this declaration,

1245
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,280
does that mean that they possibly disagree with the declaration?

1246
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,520
What is Russia's position here?

1247
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,520
Since they didn't sign the document calling for our unconditional surrender,

1248
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:22,160
does that mean they might be open to negotiating better terms for us after all?

1249
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:27,120
After receiving the Potsdam Declaration, Togo met with the Emperor to discuss it.

1250
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,320
The Emperor thought that the terms of the declaration were, quote,

1251
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,480
"...acceptable in principle,"

1252
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:38,240
but he agreed to postpone a response until after they had heard back from the Soviet Union.

1253
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,640
So Togo sent a message to Ambassador Sato on the 28th of July

1254
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:49,120
with instructions to attempt to sound out the Russian attitude towards the joint declaration.

1255
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:54,320
Ambassador Sato, for his part, had had just about enough of this nonsense.

1256
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,080
He had been repeatedly saying that the Russia plan was not going to work,

1257
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,000
and yet here's another message from Tokyo postponing surrender

1258
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,520
in order to ask what the situation is with the Russians.

1259
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,120
Sato's messages in response were openly insubordinate

1260
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,640
and strayed into brazenly telling Tokyo what to do.

1261
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,760
Sato said, and I'm paraphrasing here,

1262
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,320
"...look, if Stalin disagreed with the terms of the Potsdam Declaration,

1263
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,360
he would have negotiated better terms at the time.

1264
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,640
And if he wasn't able to negotiate better terms at the time,

1265
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,440
he's not going to be able to do that now, is he?

1266
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,560
The Soviet Union is not going to help you.

1267
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,600
In fact, if you don't immediately surrender, they are probably going to declare war on you."

1268
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:44,400
The Supreme Council, on receiving these messages, finally saw sense and decided to end the war.

1269
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,320
No, I'm joking, Sato was ignored, obviously.

1270
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,040
So the Potsdam Declaration contained no direct information about the fate of the Emperor,

1271
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,400
and it left open the question of the Soviet Union's position,

1272
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:01,520
which prompted the Japanese leadership to postpone a response until they knew what that was.

1273
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,520
Until then, their official position was to ignore the declaration.

1274
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:11,040
So if the Potsdam Declaration was intended to produce a surrender from Japan, it failed.

1275
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,240
However, when the Potsdam Declaration was first drafted

1276
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:19,440
by the Office of Secretary of War Henry Stimson, it included the following point.

1277
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,520
"...the occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan

1278
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,840
as soon as our objectives are accomplished and there has been established beyond doubt

1279
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:34,000
a peacefully inclined responsible government of a character representative of the Japanese people.

1280
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,120
This may include a constitutional monarchy under the present dynasty."

1281
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,840
So that is a concrete offer to retain the imperial institution right there.

1282
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:49,120
And earlier drafts of the Potsdam Declaration also included among the signatories

1283
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,840
the generalissimo of the Soviet Union.

1284
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,960
So, what happened here then?

1285
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,760
Well, between the first draft leaving Stimson's office and it being issued publicly,

1286
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,880
the Potsdam Declaration went through various drafts.

1287
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:09,040
Most importantly for us here, the document was edited by President Truman and James Burns.

1288
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:14,400
The final draft, of course, saw the Soviet Union being removed from the list of signatories

1289
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,000
and the offer to retain the imperial institution deleted.

1290
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,480
Firstly, on the issue of the Soviet Union being removed from the declaration,

1291
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,360
President Truman simply writes in his memoirs that

1292
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,200
"...Stalin could not, of course, be a party to the proclamation itself

1293
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,760
since he was still at peace with Japan."

1294
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:37,200
So that's Truman's stated reason for excluding the Soviet Union from the declaration.

1295
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,760
The Soviet Union is not yet in the war

1296
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,960
and technically still has a non-aggression pact in place with Japan.

1297
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,960
But why, we might ask, does this mean that the Soviet Union

1298
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,480
can't sign a document calling for Japan to surrender?

1299
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,840
I mean, Truman's stated intent for going to Potsdam

1300
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,680
was to convince the Russians to violate that non-aggression pact

1301
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,200
and have their military attack the Japanese military.

1302
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:06,080
So I'm going to go ahead and assume that respect for the sanctity of non-aggression pacts

1303
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,920
is clearly not the reason here.

1304
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,720
And if Truman is implying that he was worried that the Soviet Union signing the document

1305
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,120
would lead to war between Russia and Japan,

1306
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,480
well, that's what he's supposed to want to happen.

1307
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,800
In fact, the Soviet Union's exclusion from the final draft of the document

1308
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,040
came as an enormous surprise to the delegation from the Soviet Union,

1309
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,840
who had written their own draft of the Potsdam Declaration,

1310
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,120
which included themselves as signatories.

1311
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,720
So they clearly wanted in on the signing of the document.

1312
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:41,360
Instead, the Soviet delegation was not consulted about the drafting of the declaration

1313
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,160
and were only told it was being released to the press

1314
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:47,280
at the same time it was being released to the press.

1315
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,080
Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Molotov

1316
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,000
submitted a request to delay the publication of the declaration,

1317
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,360
but James Burns claimed he didn't get the message in time.

1318
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,420
Hmm.

1319
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,920
As for why the Soviet Union wanted to be included among the list of signatories,

1320
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,320
Stalin and Molotov wanted a pretext

1321
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,400
to abandon their non-aggression pact with Japan and invade Manchuria.

1322
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:15,680
And the Potsdam Declaration's ultimatum to Japan would have provided that pretext.

1323
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:20,480
So, after being edited out of the declaration, they tried a more direct approach.

1324
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,720
In a meeting on the 29th of July,

1325
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:26,400
Molotov submitted a request from Stalin for the United States,

1326
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,320
England, and the other Allies, quote,

1327
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:34,000
to address a formal request to the Soviet government for its entry into the war.

1328
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,520
Now, this put Truman and Burns in a very awkward position,

1329
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,320
because, of course, they're supposed to want the Soviet government to enter the war,

1330
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,560
but they clearly don't anymore.

1331
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,880
As Burns later wrote in his memoirs,

1332
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,640
"...we had, of course, begun to hope a Japanese surrender might be imminent,

1333
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:54,400
and we did not want to urge the Russians to enter the war."

1334
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,600
Truman and Burns figure they just have to wait a week or so

1335
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,680
for the first nuclear bomb to be dropped,

1336
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:05,680
and then Japan will surrender before the Soviet Union has a chance to declare war and invade.

1337
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,400
So being asked directly for an invitation to the war put Truman on the spot,

1338
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,560
and he sidestepped the issue.

1339
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,520
The Soviets will get no invitation from him.

1340
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,160
However, an interesting note here is that

1341
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,360
when the Soviet Union does actually declare war on Japan,

1342
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,440
they say they have acceded to the Allied request to join the war.

1343
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,840
So they didn't get an invitation, but they just acted like they did anyway.

1344
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,680
Now, of course, excluding the Soviets from the Potsdam Declaration

1345
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,640
and dodging their request for an invitation to join the war

1346
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,800
confirmed to Stalin that Truman was planning to finish the war without him.

1347
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:46,560
So while at Potsdam, Stalin ordered his generals to speed up their invasion plans.

1348
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,520
He wasn't going to be left out of the kill.

1349
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:54,800
So I think it's fairly clear why the Soviet Union was excluded from the Potsdam Declaration.

1350
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,400
Burns and Truman are planning to finish the war without Stalin,

1351
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,880
and that includes not having Stalin's signature on the surrender papers.

1352
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:09,440
So when Japan surrenders, it will not be, in any way, a surrender to the Soviet Union, is the plan.

1353
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,080
The second important added to the Potsdam Declaration

1354
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,520
was the removal of the offer to retain the Imperial Institution.

1355
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,640
And the reasoning for this change is found in the diary of Henry Stimson, who writes that,

1356
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,800
"...when the Potsdam conditions were drawn and left my office where they originated,

1357
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,840
they contained a provision which permitted the continuance of the dynasty with certain conditions.

1358
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,120
The President and Burns struck that out.

1359
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,080
They were not obdurate on it, but they thought they could arrange it

1360
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:41,280
in the necessary secret negotiations which would take place after any armistice."

1361
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:45,920
So Truman and Burns think the position of the Emperor is a matter to be negotiated

1362
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,560
after Japan has already surrendered.

1363
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,280
And they're both convinced that the nuclear bomb

1364
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,880
is definitely about to force an unconditional surrender from Japan.

1365
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,560
Remember that Truman is, quote,

1366
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,600
"...sure that Japan will surrender when Manhattan appears over their homeland."

1367
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,440
So given that, why should they make any concessions beforehand

1368
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,680
and risk an unnecessary backlash?

1369
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:11,760
Truman and Burns plan to use the bomb to make Japan surrender unconditionally

1370
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,560
before Russia joins the war, and anything else,

1371
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,880
like the position of the Emperor, can simply be sorted out afterwards.

1372
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,400
So here's the situation we're in at the end of the Potsdam Conference.

1373
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,880
The Japanese leadership is still refusing to accept an unconditional surrender,

1374
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,680
but Truman is refusing to accept anything less,

1375
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,880
even though on the principle point, the fate of the Emperor,

1376
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,320
both sides are in agreement.

1377
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,320
They don't want to get rid of the Emperor.

1378
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,560
But since neither side wanted to blink first, the deadlock remained.

1379
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,480
Japan waited for rescue from the Soviet Union that would never come,

1380
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,760
and the United States moved forward with the atomic bombings.

1381
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,480
The first atomic bomb was dropped in the center of Hiroshima on August 6th

1382
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,720
at about 8.15 in the morning.

1383
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,360
It exploded directly above a hospital, immediately killing everyone inside.

1384
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,360
Within the immediate blast radius were the Honkawa and Fukuromachi Elementary Schools,

1385
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,840
which were completely destroyed, instantly incinerating hundreds of schoolchildren.

1386
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:14,000
This is the purely military target right here.

1387
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,440
Now my video is about the reasons why these bombs were dropped,

1388
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,000
not the actual explosions themselves.

1389
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,280
There are many sources for first-hand accounts of the terrifying effects of the atomic bomb,

1390
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,800
and you can look those up yourself if you're in a particularly good mood today

1391
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,160
and would like to ruin it.

1392
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,200
I'll just say here that tens of thousands of civilians,

1393
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,280
including thousands of schoolchildren,

1394
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,080
were killed, permanently injured, and disfigured

1395
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,720
in a number of cruel and horrible ways.

1396
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,360
Many of those not killed by the initial blast

1397
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,080
also suffered the effects of radiation poisoning,

1398
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,040
which killed and made seriously sick many more people.

1399
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,280
Altogether, between the two atomic bombs,

1400
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:57,440
it's estimated that between 129,000 and 226,000 people were killed,

1401
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,560
and the vast majority of these were innocent civilians.

1402
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,200
This is particularly true in the case of Nagasaki,

1403
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,200
where it is estimated that of the tens of thousands of people who were killed,

1404
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,160
only 150 of them were soldiers.

1405
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:15,440
When the leadership of Japan got news of the Hiroshima bomb, they discussed what to do.

1406
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,520
Foreign Minister Togo saw in the bomb a chance to end the war,

1407
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,240
and he argued at a meeting on the 7th of August

1408
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:26,480
that Japan should now accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

1409
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,760
He was ignored.

1410
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,720
The militarists on the council were too far gone at this point

1411
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,920
to be shaken by the destruction of just one more city.

1412
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,560
War Minister Anami, after hearing the news,

1413
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:41,280
said, "...I am convinced that the Americans had only one bomb after all."

1414
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,600
Even after the destruction of Hiroshima,

1415
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:49,040
Anami and the other militarists remained committed to pursuing a negotiated peace.

1416
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,480
Togo met with the Emperor the next day, on August 8th,

1417
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,080
and they both agreed that the war was lost and they should surrender.

1418
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:00,000
But even these two, who have both wanted peace for a long time now,

1419
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,120
are still thinking at this point about the possibility of negotiating a peace.

1420
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:09,360
Togo stated after the war that while he and the Emperor wanted to end the war,

1421
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,680
quote, "...as soon as possible,"

1422
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:17,040
they would not completely discard the possibility of negotiating conditions.

1423
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,160
Armed with the Emperor's wish that the war should be ended,

1424
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,680
Togo called a meeting of the Supreme Council for the direction of the war

1425
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,480
to be held the next day, as some ministers were unavailable.

1426
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,320
And I'd like to comment on two incredibly frustrating things here.

1427
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,400
First is obviously that the Japanese leadership did not unanimously

1428
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,040
and immediately unconditionally surrender.

1429
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,080
The militarists were still conning themselves into thinking

1430
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:46,640
they would get to force favorable terms by fighting against an Allied invasion.

1431
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:52,960
The second incredibly frustrating thing is just how amazingly slowly this process is going.

1432
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,360
Hiroshima was bombed on August 6th.

1433
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,800
Togo's advice to surrender was ignored on August 7th.

1434
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,400
He met with the Emperor to discuss what to do on August 8th,

1435
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,600
and then called the Supreme Council meeting to discuss things further on August 9th,

1436
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,640
because some ministers weren't available sooner.

1437
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,040
What were they doing?

1438
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,080
They had something more important to do, clearly.

1439
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,280
Where were they?

1440
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,440
If Truman and Burns had intended the bomb

1441
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,640
to immediately shock the Japanese leadership out of the war,

1442
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,880
they severely miscalculated.

1443
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,200
The militarists heard of the destruction of Hiroshima, and they shrugged.

1444
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,440
It was just one more bombed city.

1445
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,760
They'd seen dozens of those already.

1446
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:39,840
The Emperor and the less unwise members of the council desired peace as they had before,

1447
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,920
but despite claims they wanted to end the war as quickly as possible,

1448
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,160
they too were moving in slow motion.

1449
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,680
There is an arrogant lack of urgency here.

1450
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,640
The Emperor isn't ordering an end to the war here.

1451
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:58,080
He's simply letting it be known, again, that he thinks ending the war is desirable,

1452
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,440
and asking Togo to pass the message on to the Supreme Council

1453
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,120
once they get back off their holidays or wherever it was they went.

1454
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,800
More than a full day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima,

1455
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,880
Ambassador Sato in Moscow received the following message from Tokyo.

1456
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,600
The situation is becoming more and more pressing,

1457
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,360
and we would like to know at once the explicit attitude of the Russians.

1458
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:24,640
So will you put forth still greater efforts to get a reply from them in haste?

1459
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,640
Upon reading this, I picture Sato justifiably imagining himself

1460
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:32,800
doing various types of violence to the members of the Supreme Council.

1461
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,360
Sato wouldn't have to wait long to find out, as though he needed to,

1462
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,840
the explicit attitude of the Russians.

1463
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,440
Molotov summoned Sato to the Kremlin on August 8th

1464
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:48,160
and handed him the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan,

1465
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,520
and you rarely have to feel for the poor bastard at this point.

1466
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,120
He warned them this was coming, and they didn't listen.

1467
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:58,880
The Soviet army crossed the border into Japanese-occupied Manchuria

1468
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,600
near midnight on the 8th of August and began smashing apart the Japanese defenses.

1469
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:09,440
Because their leadership had refused to accept the inevitable reality of an imminent Russian invasion,

1470
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:14,160
the underequipped Japanese troops were not prepared for or expecting a fight,

1471
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,920
and they were quickly overwhelmed.

1472
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,200
When the news of the Soviet declaration of war reached Tokyo,

1473
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:23,120
Prime Minister Suzuki met with Cabinet Secretary Sakomizu,

1474
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:27,440
and after discussing the news, came to the conclusion that their only two options

1475
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:32,000
were either to declare war on the Soviet Union and fight to certain death,

1476
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,360
or they could accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

1477
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:39,120
Suzuki met with the Emperor early in the morning on the 9th of August,

1478
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:43,920
and the Emperor agreed to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration,

1479
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,120
a meeting of the Supreme Council, was called.

1480
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,800
The six members of the council met to discuss their upcoming surrender

1481
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,920
and immediately deadlocked again.

1482
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,480
I sound like a broken record here, I know,

1483
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:00,080
but the moderate faction supported accepting the Potsdam Declaration

1484
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,680
with the singular condition that the Imperial Institution be protected,

1485
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:08,160
and the militarist faction supported accepting it only if they got to keep the Emperor,

1486
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,000
do their own war crimes trials,

1487
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,080
remain free of foreign occupation,

1488
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,680
everyone gets a pony,

1489
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:17,360
the army gets Fridays off now, etc.

1490
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,840
Hours into this ridiculous conversation,

1491
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,720
a messenger arrives to announce that Nagasaki had just been hit with a nuclear bomb.

1492
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:29,040
Now, if anyone expects this news to have any impact whatsoever

1493
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,280
upon the impasse in the Supreme Council,

1494
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:35,280
I have done a very poor job of explaining what the Supreme Council is like.

1495
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:39,760
The bombing of Nagasaki, of course, had no effect whatsoever.

1496
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,760
The council remained deadlocked.

1497
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,280
They spoke for hours.

1498
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,520
They upgraded to a full government cabinet meeting with 16 members.

1499
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,080
They spoke for hours again in that meeting.

1500
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,600
No conclusion was reached, and they broke for dinner.

1501
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,800
Now, I wouldn't blame anyone for considering this a very unlikely sequence of events.

1502
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,280
How could they be hit with two nuclear bombs

1503
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,000
and that still not be enough to break this deadlock?

1504
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,840
And the answer to that is they, the Supreme Council,

1505
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,720
haven't been hit with any nuclear bombs.

1506
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,640
Some unimportant peasants somewhere have been hit with nuclear bombs.

1507
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,600
The council are fine. They don't care.

1508
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,880
This brings us back to one of the failures of morale bombing.

1509
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:26,080
Totalitarian, militaristic regimes don't give a toss about their citizens.

1510
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,120
You can't frighten them by killing poor people.

1511
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,800
That's their day job.

1512
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,320
At one or other of these council meetings prior to the end of the war,

1513
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:39,600
Chief of the Army General Staff Umezu was asked about Japan's defense against atomic bombs,

1514
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,560
and he replied,

1515
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,800
So that's the militarist position on the bombs stated pretty clearly there.

1516
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,160
They don't really care.

1517
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:05,520
The nuclear bombs were no reason to surrender.

1518
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,680
This impasse in the council did need to be broken somehow, though.

1519
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:14,080
So Suzuki, Togo, and Sakomizu met in the Prime Minister's office

1520
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,000
and hatched a plan to have the Emperor himself resolve the argument

1521
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,480
with a sacred royal judgment, something which was highly unusual.

1522
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:27,200
The Emperor was not supposed to get involved in affairs of state so directly.

1523
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,560
To achieve this, they had to call an imperial conference.

1524
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,240
So Suzuki went to the Emperor to request that one be called,

1525
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:39,040
a request which was granted immediately, which is very shocking for this lot.

1526
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,000
I'm surprised they didn't take a week off to think about it.

1527
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,680
At this imperial conference, the members of the Supreme Council

1528
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:49,840
immediately deadlocked along the same lines as all the previous meetings.

1529
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,920
Their arguments were the same as before.

1530
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,280
The militarists wanted to insist on attaching multiple conditions

1531
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,600
to their offer to accept the Potsdam Declaration,

1532
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,160
and the moderates wanted to attach only one, the preservation of the Emperor.

1533
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:06,240
They talked until past 2 a.m. in the morning when Prime Minister Suzuki,

1534
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:09,280
talking over the protests of War Minister Onami,

1535
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:13,520
dared to ask the Emperor directly what he wanted to do.

1536
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:18,080
The Emperor said he agreed with the moderates, and this intervention did the trick.

1537
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,440
Japan would offer to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration,

1538
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:26,160
with the understanding that said declaration does not comprise any demand

1539
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,800
which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler.

1540
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,720
Truman and his advisors got the message that morning on the 10th of August,

1541
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,360
and they gathered to discuss their response.

1542
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,560
Admiral Leahy thought that the condition should be accepted.

1543
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,240
He argued that the matter of the Emperor's position was a trivial one

1544
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:48,240
compared to passing up an opportunity to bring an end to the war.

1545
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:52,400
Secretary Stimson likewise thought the condition should be accepted,

1546
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,480
and he also notes in his diary,

1547
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,520
"...in my opinion, with a slightly sarcastic tone,

1548
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:02,640
it is curious that this was the very single point that I figured would make trouble."

1549
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:06,160
And then he talks about his earlier draft of the Potsdam Declaration,

1550
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,600
which included an offer to retain the Imperial Institution,

1551
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,200
the very thing that was now delaying the end of the war.

1552
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,200
If Stimson managed not to say,

1553
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,560
"...I told you so,"

1554
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,120
then he's a more disciplined man than I.

1555
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,600
In support of accepting the Japanese condition,

1556
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:26,240
Stimson argued that the United States wanted to keep the Emperor anyway.

1557
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:30,640
They needed to use his power to convince the Japanese military to stand down.

1558
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:34,000
Stimson was also aware that time was a factor here.

1559
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
The Soviet Army was on the march,

1560
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,520
and he thought that the war with Japan needed to be ended quickly

1561
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,200
before the Russians were able to reach the Japanese homeland.

1562
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,760
James Burns, on the other hand, said,

1563
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,560
"...no, we should not accept this condition.

1564
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,680
I do not see why we should retreat from our demand for unconditional surrender," he said.

1565
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,760
"...If any conditions are to be accepted,

1566
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:00,080
I want the United States and not Japan to state the conditions."

1567
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:03,280
That was his account of his words from his memoirs there.

1568
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:07,840
So the conditions, to the unconditional surrender, work that out,

1569
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,680
should be coming from us here.

1570
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:13,760
They lost the war, why do they get to say the conditions?

1571
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,320
We won, we say the conditions.

1572
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,320
A justification for Burns' position is found in Stimson's diary,

1573
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,440
where he writes that,

1574
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:25,360
"...Burns was troubled and anxious to find out whether we could accept this

1575
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:29,520
in light of some of the public statements by Roosevelt and Truman.

1576
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,840
Of course, during three years of a bitter war,

1577
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,800
there have been bitter statements made about the Emperor.

1578
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,880
Now they come to plague us."

1579
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,000
So according to Stimson, Burns is again worried here

1580
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,400
about the public perception of backing away from unconditional surrender.

1581
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:48,880
We've been calling the Emperor a monstrous dictator for the last three years,

1582
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,880
and now we're gonna let him off the hook because he told us to?

1583
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,400
That's not gonna play.

1584
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,000
So Truman and his advisors came up with a compromise position.

1585
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,120
They would send a note to Japan, written by Burns,

1586
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,960
intending to imply, without stating it so directly,

1587
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,840
that Japan would be allowed to keep the Emperor.

1588
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,280
The note stated that,

1589
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:13,440
"...the Emperor shall issue his commands to all the Japanese military,

1590
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,360
naval, and air authorities,

1591
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,880
and to all the forces under their control wherever located,

1592
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,640
to cease active operations and to surrender their arms,

1593
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:27,200
and to issue such other orders as the Supreme Commander may require

1594
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,520
to give effect to the surrender terms."

1595
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,960
So they're giving the Emperor a list of jobs, basically.

1596
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,600
They're implying that he gets to stay around

1597
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,880
by laying out what his role is going to be going forward.

1598
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,040
And the note also states that,

1599
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,840
"...the ultimate form of government of Japan shall,

1600
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,160
in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration,

1601
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:50,720
be established by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people."

1602
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:55,280
Truman sums up the intended aim of the Burns note in his diary when he says,

1603
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,560
"...they wanted to make a condition precedent to the surrender.

1604
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,800
They wanted to keep the Emperor.

1605
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:05,360
We told him we'd tell him how to keep him, but we'd make the terms."

1606
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,560
So what's happened here is the United States said to Japan,

1607
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,960
"...we demand you surrender unconditionally."

1608
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,160
And Japan responded,

1609
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:15,040
"...we will gladly accept unconditional surrender

1610
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:19,920
on the condition that you first agree to this condition to that unconditional surrender."

1611
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,840
To which the United States responded,

1612
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,440
"...oh, we will happily agree to this condition to the unconditional surrender

1613
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,960
on the condition that you agree that you're accepting the condition,

1614
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,120
not that we are accepting the condition.

1615
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:35,760
You're keeping the Emperor because we want that, not because you want that.

1616
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,880
So there."

1617
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,920
When the Japanese leadership received the Burns note,

1618
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,040
well, we all know how this goes by now, don't we?

1619
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,360
There was yet another stalemate.

1620
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,760
They disagreed over its exact meaning.

1621
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,920
There were arguments, plots, threats, proposed possible revisions to the note.

1622
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:58,480
Prime Minister Suzuki swapped sides for a bit and then swapped back again.

1623
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,160
None of this matters at all.

1624
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:03,520
They're just wasting time not accomplishing anything.

1625
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,760
After several days of this nonsense,

1626
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,920
the Emperor intervened to break the stalemate... again.

1627
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,240
On August 14th, the Emperor summoned his cabinet to an Imperial conference,

1628
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:18,000
listened once more to the tedious arguments of the militarists,

1629
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,040
and responded that he had not changed his mind and still wanted to end the war.

1630
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:29,440
This second direct intervention finally mercifully brought about a surrender.

1631
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,040
Japan would accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

1632
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,440
At 12 midday on August 15th,

1633
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:41,200
the Emperor broadcast by public radio an address announcing that the war was over.

1634
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:45,360
Now around this time, there was a coup attempt organized by some junior officers

1635
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,040
in the Japanese military trying to prevent Japan's surrender,

1636
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:53,760
but they failed to gain support of the military leadership and it quickly fizzled out.

1637
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,800
War Minister Anami refused to support the coup,

1638
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,160
choosing instead to go home and commit suicide.

1639
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,880
And though the war with the other allies was over,

1640
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:08,960
Stalin stepped up his offensive against the Japanese-occupied territories he wished to capture.

1641
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:13,920
Surrender or no surrender, Stalin was going to take what he felt he was owed.

1642
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:17,600
And Russia's annexing, for instance, of several of the Kuril Islands

1643
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,040
led to a dispute over ownership that is still going on today,

1644
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:25,680
with both Japan and Russia arguing over who has sovereignty of the islands,

1645
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:28,080
when, really, it should be neither of them.

1646
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:32,640
There were already people on those islands before either Russia or Japan turned up.

1647
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,840
Other than that though, the Second World War was over.

1648
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,200
Just about.

1649
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,600
Now, with regards to our main topic today, we can ask a question.

1650
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,320
What effect did the nuclear bombs have on Japan's decision to end the war?

1651
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:51,920
Well, Japan needed three main things, I would argue, in order to end the war.

1652
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:57,280
Firstly, they had to be in a hopeless military situation with no chance of winning the war

1653
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,960
and be aware of that.

1654
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,240
And this one we can tick off.

1655
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:05,760
The Japanese leadership knew it had no chance to actually defeat the allies militarily.

1656
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,000
They had known that for quite a while.

1657
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,440
Their only hope for their military was to use whatever was left of it

1658
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:15,520
to drag out the war with the hopes of securing better peace terms for themselves.

1659
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:21,440
Secondly, Japan had to be in a hopeless diplomatic situation and be aware of that.

1660
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Now, ever since the Russians signed the secret pact to declare war on Japan at the Yalta Conference,

1661
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,920
the Japanese government was in a hopeless diplomatic situation.

1662
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,520
But for a long time, they didn't understand that they were.

1663
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:40,960
They held out hope for Russian mediation all the way until the Soviet Union declared war on them.

1664
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,360
Now, some of the actions of the Allies undoubtedly contributed to Japan

1665
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,840
not understanding the position they were in,

1666
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:51,600
principal among those probably being the Soviet Union's signature

1667
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,080
being struck off the Potsdam Declaration.

1668
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:59,280
But we also can't ignore the capacity for willful ignorance and self-deception

1669
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,600
among the members of the Japanese leadership.

1670
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:05,840
They should have known their situation was hopeless.

1671
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,200
After the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, however,

1672
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:13,280
the Japanese leadership finally understood this second point.

1673
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,760
And I'd like to add something here.

1674
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:20,240
The strategic bombing survey that I mentioned at the start of the video stated,

1675
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:24,160
Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped,

1676
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,320
even if Russia had not entered the war,

1677
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,080
and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.

1678
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:34,320
Now, I don't actually agree with that on the Russia point, anyway.

1679
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,120
I personally feel that if the Japanese leadership,

1680
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:40,000
with regards to getting help from the Soviet Union,

1681
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,640
thought there was any hope remaining whatsoever,

1682
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,800
they probably never would have surrendered,

1683
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,480
even if it meant their entire country was burned to the ground.

1684
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,760
The Soviet Union declaring war on Japan was crucial,

1685
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:55,840
in that it forced them to confront their hopeless diplomatic situation.

1686
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,440
To return to our list of things Japan needed in order to end the war,

1687
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:04,480
third is an assurance that the Imperial Institution would not be abolished.

1688
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:07,360
This was the main problem the Japanese leadership had

1689
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:11,360
with the Allied demand for unconditional surrender, of course.

1690
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:16,640
And I'd argue that the question of the Emperor was the most important point on this list.

1691
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,640
And that's both on a national level,

1692
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:22,560
the Emperor being a very important figure in Japanese society,

1693
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,720
but also on a personal level,

1694
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:28,720
because it's the Emperor himself intervening to end the war.

1695
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:34,240
So an assurance that the Emperor himself would not be executed as a result of doing that

1696
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,040
would probably help to speed things along there.

1697
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,480
People who defend the atomic bombings as being necessary

1698
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:44,320
often point to the bluster of the Japanese militarists who were,

1699
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,600
even after the bombings and the Russian declaration of war,

1700
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,760
still promising to fight to the last,

1701
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:54,000
with the desperate idea of somehow securing better terms for themselves.

1702
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,760
But they didn't do that once the Emperor intervened.

1703
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,080
And the Emperor intervened not to avoid more cities being destroyed.

1704
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:05,360
Remember, dozens of cities had already been destroyed.

1705
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:09,440
The Emperor intervened to protect the Imperial office.

1706
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,200
In a post-war interview,

1707
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:16,240
he explained one of his reasons for choosing to intervene as being that, quote,

1708
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,720
"...if the enemy landed near Ise Bay,

1709
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:22,960
both Ise and Atsuta shrines would immediately come under their control.

1710
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:27,840
There would be no time to transfer the sacred regalia of the Imperial family,

1711
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,000
and no hope of protecting them."

1712
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,960
Now, you'd think that protecting the Imperial knick-knacks

1713
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:37,840
would be an unmentionably minor concern when compared to the nuclear bombing raids,

1714
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,120
but apparently not.

1715
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:42,960
The Emperor took all this Emperor business very seriously,

1716
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,600
as did the rest of the Japanese government.

1717
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:50,000
The militarists on the Supreme Council might have wanted to hold out for better terms,

1718
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,480
even if it meant fighting to the death,

1719
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:56,800
but they were not prepared to contradict the will of the Emperor.

1720
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,520
Admiral Leahy wrote in his memoirs that himself and Secretary Stimson,

1721
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,080
in their combined staff meetings, were, quote,

1722
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,840
"...certain that the Mikado..."

1723
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,160
That's an antiquated term for the Emperor.

1724
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,680
"...could stop the war with a royal word."

1725
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,920
And this turned out to be accurate.

1726
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,360
That is how the war was stopped on the Japanese end.

1727
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:23,040
Now, I don't want to get too deep into speculation about alternate history timelines today,

1728
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:27,200
but I think it's fairly obvious that President Truman and James Burns,

1729
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:31,920
deleting the offer to retain the Imperial institution from the Potsdam Declaration,

1730
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,400
almost certainly lengthened the war.

1731
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:38,400
If the Emperor didn't intervene to bring about a surrender immediately

1732
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,280
upon receiving peace terms that assured his position,

1733
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,280
he almost certainly would have,

1734
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,720
when that was coupled with a Soviet declaration of war.

1735
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:49,840
Japan had only been holding out for Russian mediation

1736
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,720
in the hopes of securing better peace terms.

1737
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:57,680
After the Soviet declaration of war, that option was fully off the table.

1738
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,400
So I'd say it's vastly more likely than not

1739
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:04,720
that having in hand both a declaration of war from the Soviet Union

1740
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:09,680
and surrender terms from the other Allies that assured the Imperial House would survive,

1741
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:12,160
the Emperor would have ended the war right there,

1742
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:16,240
regardless of whether Japan had been hit with nuclear bombs or not.

1743
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:19,280
Henry Stimson later noted in his memoirs that,

1744
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,160
"...it is possible, in light of the final surrender,

1745
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:27,440
that a clearer and earlier exposition of American willingness to retain the Emperor

1746
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,720
would have produced an earlier ending to the war."

1747
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,760
And he concluded in 1948 that,

1748
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,640
"...history might find that the United States,

1749
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:41,360
by its delay in stating its position, had prolonged the war."

1750
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,560
Now, it would be very simple to conclude at this point that,

1751
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,480
with regards to the end of the war,

1752
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,120
the question of the Emperor was everything,

1753
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:52,080
and the nuclear bombs didn't do anything.

1754
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,400
But is that really the case?

1755
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,480
Let's pose a few questions.

1756
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:57,920
Firstly, we can ask,

1757
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,360
were the bombs necessary to defeat Japan militarily?

1758
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:04,160
And the answer to that is obviously no.

1759
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,320
The Japanese leadership were beaten,

1760
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:09,760
and they knew they were beaten long before the bombs were dropped.

1761
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,640
So, were the bombs necessary to defeat Japan

1762
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:18,080
without needing to carry out a ground invasion of the four main Japanese islands?

1763
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:22,160
Well, to start with, we've quoted multiple US military leaders today

1764
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,480
who say that Japan was ready to surrender

1765
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:28,080
without either an invasion or the bombs being necessary.

1766
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:31,520
But can we really trust their judgment of the situation?

1767
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,640
You see, those leaders had a couple of potential reasons

1768
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:37,600
to downplay the effectiveness of the bomb.

1769
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,360
The first of these is simply that

1770
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,560
they didn't want to be put out of a job by this thing.

1771
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,840
The worry there was that,

1772
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,560
if the atomic bombs really are that effective,

1773
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,880
then maybe we don't need such a large conventional military force anymore.

1774
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,040
So, clear your desk.

1775
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,920
And another reason, I imagine, was pride.

1776
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,720
If it's you who's been fighting the war all this time,

1777
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:02,720
backing Japan into a corner and bringing them to the verge of surrender,

1778
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:05,440
you probably don't want the narrative afterwards to be

1779
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:09,920
scientists save the day and end the war with their new bomb.

1780
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,360
It kind of undercuts all the work you did prior to that.

1781
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:17,040
So I can see the motive there for US military leaders at the time to say,

1782
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:27,280
However, these ulterior motives do not mean that the military leaders

1783
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:31,840
who spoke out against the bomb were necessarily lying or wrong.

1784
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,920
We know from what we've talked about today

1785
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:37,120
that the Japanese leadership was close to surrender,

1786
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:40,240
and was, as President Truman wrote in his diary,

1787
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,760
asking for peace.

1788
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:45,360
Japan would have surrendered long before an invasion if,

1789
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:49,760
for instance, they thought they could secure terms which were acceptable to them.

1790
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,120
They didn't actually want to be invaded just for the sake of it,

1791
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:58,000
they were holding out for an invasion in the hopes of avoiding an unconditional surrender.

1792
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,120
So US military leaders who claimed the bombs were not necessary to end the war were correct,

1793
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:06,400
even if they had an ulterior motive for saying so.

1794
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:08,320
Instead of a motivation to lie,

1795
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:12,720
they could just have easily have had a motivation to tell an uncomfortable truth.

1796
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,400
So then, were the bombs necessary to force Japan

1797
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:20,800
to offer to surrender on the Allied terms without any conditions?

1798
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,960
And the answer to this is also no, because they didn't do that.

1799
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,120
Even after two atomic bombs,

1800
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:31,120
the Japanese leadership still only offered to surrender on the condition

1801
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:33,840
that they were assured they could keep the Emperor.

1802
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:38,400
And between that offer to surrender and their eventual actual surrender,

1803
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,440
they didn't get hit with any more nuclear bombs.

1804
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:44,720
All this being said, I do not think that the nuclear bombs

1805
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:48,880
had absolutely no effect at all on Japan's decision to surrender.

1806
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,800
It would be going much too far to make that claim, in my opinion.

1807
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,440
I'd say there were two main effects that the bombs had upon the end of the war.

1808
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:02,160
Firstly, the nuclear bomb probably indirectly shortened the war,

1809
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:07,200
because its existence prompted Truman to try to finish the war without the Soviet Union,

1810
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:11,760
which in turn prompted Stalin to speed up his plans to declare war on Japan,

1811
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:16,400
and that declaration of war sped up the Emperor intervening in the Supreme Council

1812
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,640
to bring about an offer to surrender, with their condition, of course.

1813
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,480
The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on the 8th of August,

1814
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:28,640
and it's likely that if they weren't racing to get in the war as quickly as possible,

1815
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,600
they would have declared war later in August sometime,

1816
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,440
the 15th is what Stalin told Truman at Potsdam.

1817
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,640
So we can say that, all other things being equal,

1818
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:43,520
the existence of the atomic bomb probably shortened the war by a week or so.

1819
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:48,480
The other effect the nuclear bomb had on the end of the war is a rather interesting one.

1820
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:54,160
And let's read a post-war quote from Cabinet Secretary Sakomizu talking about the bomb.

1821
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,560
"...the chance had come to end the war.

1822
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:02,400
It was not necessary to blame the military side, the manufacturing people, or anyone else,

1823
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,320
just the atomic bomb.

1824
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,320
It was a good excuse.

1825
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:10,800
Someone said the atomic bomb was the kamikaze to save Japan."

1826
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:16,800
So, the bomb provided the non-military Japanese leadership with an excuse to proclaim defeat

1827
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,440
that didn't involve blaming, or shaming, their proud military.

1828
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:24,720
It lessened the risk of a revolt of the armed forces,

1829
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:28,400
and it was a way to end the war while salvaging some pride,

1830
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:35,440
as well as casting those killed by the bombs not as civilian war victims, but as heroic martyrs.

1831
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:40,080
The Emperor's radio announcement declaring the end of the war took a similar approach.

1832
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:44,880
Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb,

1833
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,960
the power of which to do damage is indeed incalculable,

1834
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,920
taking the toll of many innocent lives.

1835
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:56,000
Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in an ultimate collapse

1836
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,160
and obliteration of the Japanese nation,

1837
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:02,720
but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.

1838
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:05,520
So the bomb allowed the Japanese leadership to say,

1839
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,640
hey, we weren't beaten in a fair fight here.

1840
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:12,720
Our brave military was gearing up for a decisive last battle,

1841
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:16,880
but those cowardly Americans, they were too scared to face us.

1842
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:22,800
So they invented this terrible bomb and started dropping it on innocent civilians, those monsters.

1843
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:26,000
So I suppose we have to be the adults in the room here

1844
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:31,440
and agree to stand down before you lunatics go and blow up the whole planet in a nuclear war.

1845
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:38,480
So instead of being beaten fairly here, we're sort of like heroes for giving up, right?

1846
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,800
Does anyone buy that?

1847
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:45,840
Now this is desperate spin from a government trying to salvage whatever pride it could.

1848
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,240
Anyone who takes this at face value,

1849
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:51,760
particularly the bit about the toll of many innocent lives,

1850
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,240
is falling for imperial propaganda.

1851
01:50:54,240 --> 01:51:00,000
The Emperor and the Japanese leadership did not care about the innocent civilian casualties.

1852
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,680
The Supreme Council's plan for their civilians was for them to die in a wave of suicide attacks,

1853
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:08,560
fighting a vastly better equipped allied military.

1854
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:14,080
So do not lie to me that they suddenly came over all sympathetic about their poor subjects.

1855
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:18,560
The problem for the Japanese leadership was not that innocent civilians were being killed,

1856
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:23,200
it's that innocent civilians were being killed in a manner that was not useful.

1857
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:26,560
They didn't want them being blown up in nuclear explosions,

1858
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,960
they wanted them rushing American machine guns armed with bamboo sticks.

1859
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,600
If they actually gave a toss about their civilians,

1860
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:38,160
they would have surrendered months before they did when it was obvious the war was lost.

1861
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:44,000
Instead, they selfishly hung on, trying to save their own positions and reputations.

1862
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,880
They didn't want to take responsibility for the enormous mistake they had made.

1863
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:53,120
So the bomb provided to the Japanese government an excuse to end the war

1864
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:56,160
that did not involve blaming anyone in particular.

1865
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:00,560
It's not anyone's fault all this, it's not like we did anything wrong,

1866
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:05,040
it's just that they've got nuclear bombs now, and there's no accounting for that.

1867
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:08,640
So it's possible in this regard that the bombs also shortened the war

1868
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:14,240
by providing a face-saving excuse for the Japanese leadership to call it quits.

1869
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:17,120
Now, as for whether this was a decisive factor,

1870
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:21,840
as in if the bombs didn't exist and the Japanese government had no similar excuse

1871
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:26,160
they wouldn't have surrendered when they did, I honestly can't say.

1872
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:30,160
However, I will note that both of these possible effects of the bombs,

1873
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:33,280
those being speeding up the Soviet declaration of war

1874
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,880
and providing a face-saving excuse to quit,

1875
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:40,960
do not require the bombs to be dropped in the middle of cities.

1876
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,000
And this is a very important point that often goes overlooked

1877
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,200
in the debate about whether the bombs were necessary or not.

1878
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,920
Because beyond whether the bombs were necessary,

1879
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,560
we also need to ask whether or not it was necessary

1880
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:56,320
to use the bombs in the manner in which they were used.

1881
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:01,760
There are other ways to use nuclear bombs than to drop them on civilians, of course.

1882
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:05,120
On that note, this person is Leo Szilard.

1883
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:09,200
Szilard was a Hungarian physicist who, in 1933,

1884
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:12,560
conceived the idea of a nuclear chain reaction.

1885
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:17,920
Szilard once lived in Germany, but he left when Hitler became the chancellor.

1886
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:21,600
In 1939, Szilard approached Albert Einstein

1887
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:24,800
and asked him to put his name to a letter Szilard had written,

1888
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:28,240
warning then-President Roosevelt about the possibility

1889
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:31,280
of Nazi development of nuclear weapons.

1890
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:35,280
The Einstein-Zilard letter prompted action by Roosevelt,

1891
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:38,320
leading to the creation of the Manhattan Project,

1892
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,400
which Szilard also worked on.

1893
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:44,000
Now, Szilard and many other scientists working on the project

1894
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,840
were motivated by fears of a nuclear Nazi Germany,

1895
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:50,320
something which, thankfully, never came about.

1896
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,520
Once it was clear the Nazis would be defeated, however,

1897
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:59,680
several scientists began warning against the now unnecessary use of the nuclear bomb.

1898
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:03,840
A document called the Frank Report was put together in 1945

1899
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,520
and signed by several prominent physicists, including Szilard.

1900
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,880
The Frank Report warned about the possibility of the bomb's use

1901
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,280
triggering an international arms race

1902
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:17,200
and strongly advised against an unannounced attack against Japan.

1903
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:21,440
The scientists behind the Frank Report instead advised Truman that, quote,

1904
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:24,560
"...a demonstration of the new weapon may best be made

1905
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:28,080
before the eyes of representatives of all United Nations

1906
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:30,720
on the desert or a barren island."

1907
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:33,520
Now, allow me to lay my cards on the table here

1908
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,880
and say that this is how I think things should have been handled.

1909
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:40,160
A public announcement and demonstration of the bomb,

1910
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:42,720
coupled with an explicit warning to Japan,

1911
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:45,840
would have provided the peace faction in the Japanese government

1912
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:50,160
with the exact same excuse to quit without blaming their military.

1913
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:52,160
The Emperor could still have done his

1914
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:55,280
we're pulling out of the war to save the world routine,

1915
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:59,200
except without two cities full of civilians being destroyed.

1916
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:02,640
If the nuclear bombs were influential in ending the war,

1917
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:06,160
it was by their existence, not by their use.

1918
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:08,880
In order to use them as an excuse to surrender,

1919
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:12,480
the Japanese leadership just needed to know about them,

1920
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:14,480
not actually be hit by them.

1921
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,520
One argument against demonstrating the bomb publicly

1922
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,240
was that they were worried it might not work.

1923
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,920
Henry Stimson later wrote that,

1924
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:25,520
nothing would have been more damaging to our effort to obtain surrender

1925
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:29,200
than a warning or a demonstration followed by a dud,

1926
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:32,160
which is a perfectly valid line of reasoning.

1927
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:35,760
Until the Trinity test, when you know they work.

1928
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,920
After that, there's no excuse.

1929
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:40,080
And the infuriating thing about this

1930
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:44,000
is that if this public demonstration and warning didn't work,

1931
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,440
you could still then use them against Japan afterwards.

1932
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:50,240
I mean, you shouldn't drop them on cities, regardless,

1933
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:52,000
but you could do that.

1934
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,560
Doing it this way around costs you nothing

1935
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:58,160
and potentially spurs the lives of two cities full of civilians.

1936
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:02,480
The United States absolutely should have went public with the bomb.

1937
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:05,920
However, with regards to the Frank Report's suggestions,

1938
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:10,240
Groves and Oppenheimer didn't appreciate this bunch of bleeding hearts

1939
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:12,800
telling them what to do with their new toy.

1940
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,600
Oppenheimer had previously written about the quote,

1941
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,400
fallacy of regarding a controlled test

1942
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:21,040
as the culmination of the work of this laboratory.

1943
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:24,720
The laboratory is operating under a directive to produce weapons.

1944
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:28,800
This directive has been and will be rigorously adhered to.

1945
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,880
So they didn't put in all this time and effort

1946
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:34,960
just to blow up an empty field somewhere for some diplomats and journalists.

1947
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:36,400
They were making a weapon

1948
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:40,000
and they were going to drop it on a city without warning.

1949
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,560
The Frank Report was ignored.

1950
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,000
Not to be deterred, Leo Szilard put together a petition

1951
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,640
signed by 70 Manhattan Project scientists

1952
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:51,200
warning Truman about the possibility of quote,

1953
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:55,760
opening the door to an era of devastation on an unimaginable scale.

1954
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:58,640
In attempting to get this petition to the president,

1955
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:02,720
Szilard, on the 28th of May, met with James Burns,

1956
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:07,840
who, I'm sure you can guess, was not very sympathetic to Szilard's view.

1957
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,360
Szilard later stated,

1958
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:12,800
Burns was concerned about Russia's post-war behavior.

1959
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,680
Russian forces had moved into Hungary and Romania.

1960
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:18,320
Burns thought it would be very difficult to persuade Russia

1961
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,320
to withdraw its troops from these countries

1962
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:25,120
and that Russia would be more manageable if impressed by American military might.

1963
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:29,680
I shared Burns' concern about Russia's throwing its weight around in the post-war period,

1964
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:32,480
but I was completely flabbergasted by the assumption

1965
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:36,240
that rattling the bomb might make Russia more manageable.

1966
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:39,440
Szilard's petition never did make it to Truman.

1967
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:43,600
Now, this quote from Burns here about making the Russians more manageable,

1968
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:47,040
along with other documents that came to light in the post-war period,

1969
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:50,320
for instance, the target committee's desire for the bomb to be used

1970
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:53,280
in a manner that would ensure international recognition,

1971
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:57,680
and Truman's diary entries revealing that he knew of the emperor's desire for peace

1972
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:59,360
prior to the bombs being used,

1973
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:03,120
allowed certain people to construct an alternative historical narrative

1974
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:08,480
to the accepted story of America using the bomb to avoid an invasion of Japan.

1975
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:12,960
In this new telling, America, thinking ahead to the post-war period,

1976
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:18,400
used the bomb primarily as an indirect diplomatic weapon against the Soviet Union,

1977
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:22,560
rather than as a direct military weapon against the Empire of Japan.

1978
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:27,200
Now, there is evidence to support that this motivation was certainly a factor.

1979
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:31,280
It definitely was for Secretary of State James Burns, for instance,

1980
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:36,480
but this evidence has led some to conclude that the bombs were dropped solely to intimidate Russia,

1981
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:39,040
and this is going much too far, in my opinion.

1982
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:44,240
Anyone who points to a singular reason as the explanation for why the bombs were dropped

1983
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:46,960
is definitely oversimplifying the history.

1984
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:50,400
The bombs were dropped for a combination of many reasons,

1985
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,480
and let's list some of them.

1986
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:57,680
So first, the bombs were dropped, in part, to limit Soviet influence in Asia

1987
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:03,440
and make other diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Union go smoother for the United States.

1988
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:06,480
Although this turned out to be an enormous miscalculation,

1989
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:10,400
it was assumed, incorrectly, that it would take the Soviets a lot longer

1990
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:13,440
to develop their own nuclear weapons than it actually did,

1991
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:19,280
and the United States would get to enjoy a long stretch of time as the world's only nuclear power.

1992
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:24,080
Unbeknownst to Truman, however, Stalin had spies inside the Manhattan Project

1993
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:27,600
who were sending plans and information back to Russia,

1994
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:32,640
in just a few short years, the Soviet Union would be testing their own nuclear weapons,

1995
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:35,520
and the feared arms race was on.

1996
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:39,680
Next, the bombs were dropped, in part, to force an end to the war

1997
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:44,400
without the United States being seen to back down from unconditional surrender.

1998
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,880
It was more preferable to certain people

1999
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:50,560
that the United States set off nuclear bombs in the middle of cities

2000
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:55,920
than the president take a knock to his popularity by looking hypocritical or weak.

2001
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:00,640
Another possible reason the bombs were dropped was to justify their expense.

2002
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:03,200
Admiral Leahy argues in his memoirs that,

2003
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:07,360
"...it was my reaction that the scientists and others wanted to make this test

2004
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:11,040
because of the vast sums that had been spent on the project.

2005
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:14,240
Truman knew that and so did other people involved."

2006
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:17,360
The Manhattan Project was enormously expensive

2007
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:23,120
and diverted many of the United States' top scientists and engineers away from other useful work.

2008
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:27,840
It was very costly in terms of dollars, materials, and manpower,

2009
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:31,840
and the project's management wanted something to show for the expense.

2010
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:36,720
They didn't want the culmination of their work to simply be blowing up a field somewhere.

2011
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,920
Another motivation, surely, was revenge.

2012
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:43,920
The White House press release announcing the use of the bomb at Hiroshima stated,

2013
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,360
"...the Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor.

2014
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,240
They have been repaid many fold."

2015
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:54,960
So this thinking is that the Japanese began the war with a sneak attack.

2016
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:58,000
They carried out many war crimes and atrocities.

2017
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
They mistreated prisoners of war.

2018
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,800
And even though they began the war and lost it,

2019
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:05,360
they still arrogantly refused to surrender

2020
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:10,800
and dared to try and impose their own surrender terms on the Allied forces that had beaten them.

2021
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:14,640
So yeah, we bombed them, but they were asking for it.

2022
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:18,320
This motivation would be a lot more sympathetic and understandable

2023
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:21,280
had the bombs not been dropped on civilians.

2024
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:24,400
Because counter to what the White House press release said,

2025
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:27,920
the Japanese did not begin the war at Pearl Harbor.

2026
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:31,280
The Japanese leadership and military did that.

2027
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:34,160
The Japanese civilians were not consulted.

2028
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:38,480
If the United States wanted to use the bombs to pay back Pearl Harbor,

2029
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:41,360
they should have dropped one on a military target.

2030
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:44,000
Or the Supreme Council, I suppose.

2031
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,680
Related to that last point,

2032
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:51,360
another motivation that influenced the use of the bombs was just basic, regular racism.

2033
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:56,560
It is very worth remembering that the racist ideas that inspired Nazi Germany

2034
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:01,360
to commit such terrible atrocities were not limited to that country's borders.

2035
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:03,760
When we've been talking about America today,

2036
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:08,160
it was an America decades prior to the signing of the Civil Rights Act.

2037
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:12,320
James Burns, a very influential figure in the events we've been talking about,

2038
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,120
was a supporter of racial segregation.

2039
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:20,320
And President Truman himself referred to the Japanese people as beasts several times.

2040
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:23,440
And once, when defending the use of the bombs specifically,

2041
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,240
he wrote that,

2042
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,840
This is also undoubtedly one of the reasons that Japan,

2043
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:36,080
and not Nazi Germany, was targeted with the nuclear bombs.

2044
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:38,400
It was much easier for the people behind the bomb

2045
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,800
to justify the use of such a destructive weapon

2046
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:44,080
if it wasn't going to be used to kill white people.

2047
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,760
And now, hold up a second,

2048
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:48,080
scroll back up, everyone who just scrolled down,

2049
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:49,680
to type in the comment box that

2050
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:53,280
of course the bombs were used against Japan and not Nazi Germany.

2051
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:57,200
Nazi Germany surrendered before the bombs were ready to be used.

2052
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:59,040
Now, I know that, obviously,

2053
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,720
but I didn't say used.

2054
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:02,160
I said targeted.

2055
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:05,200
And Japan was chosen as the target for the nuclear bombs

2056
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:08,160
two years before Nazi Germany's surrender.

2057
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:12,560
Japan was chosen as the target way back in 1943.

2058
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:15,680
And when General Leslie Groves briefed President Truman

2059
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:19,200
about the project in April 1945, he stated,

2060
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,600
Another factor behind the use of the bombs

2061
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:28,640
was simply the momentum of the project.

2062
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:30,640
At the top of the United States leadership,

2063
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:33,040
there was a vacuum of responsibility.

2064
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:36,480
With Roosevelt's death and the newly installed President Truman

2065
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:39,840
only just learning about the project near to its completion,

2066
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:43,280
there's a sense that things were simply too far along to be halted,

2067
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,920
without very firm leadership, anyway.

2068
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:49,440
Truman's job was not to get in the bomb's way.

2069
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:52,880
Leslie Groves described Truman's role in the atomic bombings as,

2070
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:02,320
He was a rubber stamp for the project, basically.

2071
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:05,840
Truman simply assumed the bomb would be used when ready.

2072
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,000
He didn't even give a specific order for the first two bombs to be dropped.

2073
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,920
And after the first two bombs, it was ordered that no more would be dropped

2074
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:16,640
without his explicit permission to do so.

2075
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:20,480
Which of course implies that they didn't need that permission beforehand.

2076
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:23,520
We can see something of an abdication of responsibility

2077
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:25,680
among those behind the nuclear bomb.

2078
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:27,680
In his memoirs, Truman states,

2079
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:30,800
I had realized, of course, that the atomic bomb explosion

2080
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:34,160
would inflict damage and casualties beyond imagination.

2081
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:37,600
On the other hand, the scientific advisors of the committee reported,

2082
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:41,840
We can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war.

2083
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:45,520
We see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.

2084
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:49,360
It was their conclusion that no technical demonstration they might propose,

2085
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:53,200
such as over a deserted island, would be likely to bring the war to an end.

2086
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:56,320
It had to be used against an enemy target.

2087
02:04:56,320 --> 02:05:00,880
On the other hand, several top Manhattan Project scientists, including Oppenheimer,

2088
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:05,920
made efforts to distance themselves from what they claimed was merely a military decision.

2089
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,040
In a report issued on the 16th of June, they stated that,

2090
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:14,480
We have no claim to special competence in solving the political, social, and military problems

2091
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:17,360
which are presented by the advent of atomic power.

2092
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,920
Oppenheimer also later stated that,

2093
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,520
We didn't know beans about the military situation in Japan.

2094
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:26,720
We didn't know whether they could be caused to surrender by other means,

2095
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:29,440
or whether the invasion was really inevitable.

2096
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:33,200
So Truman's sharing responsibility with the scientists here, saying,

2097
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:35,920
Well, I knew the bomb was gonna be horrible, obviously,

2098
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:39,680
but the scientists told me a peaceful demonstration would never work,

2099
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:43,040
and that I had to drop it on a city, so, you know.

2100
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,400
And the scientists are saying,

2101
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:47,600
Hey, well, what are you listening to us for? We don't know.

2102
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:49,680
We're physicists. We just built the thing.

2103
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:53,040
We don't know about foreign policy or military strategy.

2104
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:56,480
There's a sense that nobody's really in control of this thing.

2105
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:00,800
The ball was rolling, and nobody had the inclination to stop it.

2106
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,520
I would like to add, however, that regardless of any of this,

2107
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:07,280
Truman is still responsible here, and he still made a decision,

2108
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:10,720
even if it was more of a passive decision than an active one.

2109
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:14,960
Now, all this has led some to wonder about whether or not the bombs would have been used

2110
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:18,080
had President Roosevelt not died when he did.

2111
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:22,640
Albert Einstein, who I'm told was a rather smart guy in certain regards,

2112
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:24,720
came to this conclusion, stating that,

2113
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:29,440
The use of the atomic bombs was precipitated by a desire to end the war in the Pacific

2114
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:32,400
by any means before Russia's participation.

2115
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,200
I'm sure if President Roosevelt had still been there,

2116
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:37,120
none of that would have been possible.

2117
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:41,840
So as we've seen, the bombs were dropped for a combination of many reasons,

2118
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:45,520
but none of these was to avoid an invasion of Japan.

2119
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:49,120
By the time it was an option to drop nuclear bombs on Japan,

2120
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:51,680
an invasion was already off the table.

2121
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:53,840
It was no longer necessary.

2122
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:57,680
Both Truman and Burns thought that Japan was going to surrender

2123
02:06:57,680 --> 02:07:00,640
because of the upcoming Russian declaration of war,

2124
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:05,760
and the bombs were dropped, in part, to attempt to force a surrender prior to that.

2125
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,160
Before we wrap up today, we should ask,

2126
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:11,200
Where did this invasion narrative come from?

2127
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:14,960
Why is it the enduring popular perception of events?

2128
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,200
Let's return to the start of the video,

2129
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:21,600
and talk again about what I called the trolley problem version of events.

2130
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:24,400
Now, I have a confession to make about this.

2131
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:29,600
What I do when I want to find an example of a poor argument put forward ineptly,

2132
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:33,760
is go and check if Prager University has ever made a video on the topic.

2133
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:37,040
And would you know it, they have made one about the nuclear bombs,

2134
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:40,720
titled, Was it wrong to drop the atom bomb on Japan?

2135
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:44,480
Which, of course, concludes it was completely justified.

2136
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:47,520
And the version of events written at the start of my video

2137
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:51,760
is constructed almost entirely out of statements made in their video.

2138
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:56,240
So, that's right, this was a stealth PragerU response video this whole time.

2139
02:07:56,240 --> 02:07:57,280
What a twist.

2140
02:07:57,280 --> 02:08:01,040
So this PragerU video starts out by giving far too much agency

2141
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:04,640
to a certain Mr. President Truman, when they say,

2142
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:07,840
Truman sought to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

2143
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:12,560
two major military industrial targets, to avoid an invasion of Japan.

2144
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:16,960
So they're assigning to Truman the decision of which targets to bomb there.

2145
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:21,680
Now, Truman had no input on deciding to target Hiroshima or Nagasaki,

2146
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:26,720
he didn't even know Nagasaki was going to be bombed until after it already had been.

2147
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:32,080
Nagasaki wasn't even the target city of the plane that dropped the bomb on Nagasaki,

2148
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:36,320
it only got attacked because the primary targets was too cloudy to hit.

2149
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:39,040
Now, I could pick through this video line by line,

2150
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:41,520
giving rebuttals like this to each of its claims,

2151
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:43,600
but this video is long enough already,

2152
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:46,160
so instead I just want to focus on two quotes

2153
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:49,440
that concern the bombs versus invasion narrative.

2154
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:50,880
And the first is this,

2155
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:55,040
it was only the dropping of the atom bombs that allowed the emperor

2156
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:58,640
and the so-called peace faction in the Japanese government

2157
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:01,440
to negotiate an end to the war.

2158
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,880
Now, this is just a total inversion of reality.

2159
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:09,200
The atom bombs did not allow the emperor to negotiate an end to the war,

2160
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:12,480
either with the United States or within his own government.

2161
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:15,360
The problem was not that, prior to the bombs,

2162
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:19,360
Japan was refusing to negotiate an end to the war,

2163
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:23,840
it's that they were insisting on negotiating an end to the war.

2164
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:28,160
The United States was the country refusing to negotiate an end to the war

2165
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:31,200
because they were insisting on unconditional surrender.

2166
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:35,680
And the emperor didn't negotiate an end to the war within his own government,

2167
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:37,120
he was the emperor.

2168
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:39,120
The government did what he said.

2169
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:44,240
The militarists wanted to fight to the death even after the nuclear bombs were dropped.

2170
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:47,760
There was no negotiation, there was no convincing them,

2171
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:51,520
it was a deadlock broken by the emperor's divine ruling.

2172
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:55,680
This idea that the Japanese leadership were committed to total war

2173
02:09:55,680 --> 02:10:01,520
only until the bombs forced them to the negotiating table is entirely false.

2174
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:04,720
I also have a particular distaste for the phrasing

2175
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:07,760
it was only the dropping of the atom bomb

2176
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:11,520
because Imperial Japan was beaten long before the nuclear bombs were dropped

2177
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:16,240
and pretending that it took the nuclear bombs to defeat Japan is not only untrue,

2178
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:18,400
it's a dangerous exaggeration.

2179
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:21,680
It makes the Empire of Japan into such a powerful enemy

2180
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:24,400
that you need nuclear force to take them down

2181
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:26,000
and it covers up the reality,

2182
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,600
which is that Imperial Japan was already a defeated state

2183
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:32,400
run by incompetent, ignorant leaders.

2184
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:35,280
The next quote I want to talk about is this.

2185
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:39,120
All the viable alternate scenarios to secure American victory,

2186
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:43,120
all would have meant significantly greater American and Allied casualties

2187
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:47,040
and much higher Japanese civilian and military casualties.

2188
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:49,840
According to American military estimates at the time,

2189
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:53,040
those numbers would have been well above one million.

2190
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:55,840
Now, you may have noticed today that we have not thus far

2191
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:58,480
discussed what the projected wartime casualties

2192
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:01,600
of a full Allied invasion of Japan were going to be.

2193
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:06,080
And that's because until after the war, there were no such projections made.

2194
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:08,960
This quote from PragerU here is a lie.

2195
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:12,800
The enormously high death estimates for a full invasion of Japan

2196
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:16,160
were entirely a post-war fabrication.

2197
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:19,280
Now, before we talk about where this one million figure came from,

2198
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:22,800
I'd like to remind everyone that an invasion was unnecessary

2199
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:25,200
and not going to happen anyway.

2200
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:27,280
Whatever death estimates you come up with,

2201
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:30,160
a thousand, a million, a hundred million,

2202
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:31,520
it does not matter.

2203
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:34,080
An invasion was not going to happen

2204
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:36,880
and the bombs were not used to avert it.

2205
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:38,720
Right, so with that in mind,

2206
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:42,000
this one million figure comes from an article published

2207
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:46,880
in Henry Stimson's name in Harper's Magazine in 1947.

2208
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:49,840
This article was written in response to various criticisms

2209
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:51,440
of the use of the atomic bomb,

2210
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:54,240
which had begun emerging after the end of the war,

2211
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:57,920
and it was edited by various people responsible for the bomb,

2212
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:00,240
including General Leslie Groves.

2213
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:03,600
The article lays out the trolley problem excuse.

2214
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:06,640
We simply had to do the nuclear bombs, it argues.

2215
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:08,560
There was no other way.

2216
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:11,280
Talking about the apparently inevitable invasion,

2217
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:12,320
the article states,

2218
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:15,520
"...I was informed that such operations might be expected

2219
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:19,840
to cost over a million casualties to American forces alone."

2220
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,520
Now, as I've already stated,

2221
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:24,400
there is no evidence of such an estimate being made

2222
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:26,080
prior to the end of the war,

2223
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:29,760
and President Truman at no point presented the nuclear bombs

2224
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:32,560
as an alternative to an Allied invasion of Japan

2225
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:36,400
until he had to justify the use of the bombs after the war.

2226
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:39,440
Only then did the invasion become inevitable,

2227
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:42,880
and did the death estimates shoot up into the millions.

2228
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:47,040
This is where the atom bombs versus invasion narrative comes from.

2229
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:48,480
After the bomb was dropped,

2230
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:52,160
the US leadership started telling lies about it.

2231
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:57,440
President Truman himself got started very early on August 9th, 1945,

2232
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:59,440
when he addressed the nation with a speech

2233
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:02,560
seeking to justify the use of the nuclear bomb,

2234
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:03,680
and I quote,

2235
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:07,840
"...the world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima,

2236
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:09,520
a military base.

2237
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:12,480
That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid,

2238
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:15,600
insofar as possible, the killing of civilians."

2239
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:18,240
Now, this is a lie, obviously.

2240
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:19,840
Hiroshima was a city.

2241
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:22,800
The bomb's target committee describes it as a city.

2242
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:26,400
Remember that Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size

2243
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:29,840
that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed.

2244
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:32,720
And Truman's lying continues as follows,

2245
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:35,760
"...but that attack is only a warning of things to come.

2246
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:37,440
If Japan does not surrender,

2247
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:40,720
bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries,

2248
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:44,560
and unfortunately, thousands of civilian lives will be lost.

2249
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:49,120
I urge Japanese civilians to leave industrial cities immediately,

2250
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:51,600
and save themselves from destruction."

2251
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:55,680
So Truman isn't justifying the bombing of Hiroshima by saying

2252
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:58,480
it was a city with several war industries in it,

2253
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:01,360
which is what the eventual excuse came to be.

2254
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:05,520
He's going for broke here and saying it was solely a military base,

2255
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:07,200
and that unless Japan surrenders,

2256
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:10,480
bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries,

2257
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:13,040
implying that that has not happened already.

2258
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:18,080
Averting an invasion was not given as a reason for using the bombs in this speech,

2259
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:20,720
because they hadn't come up with that excuse yet.

2260
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:26,720
Truman also here claims the bomb was used to spare the lives of thousands and thousands,

2261
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:29,840
not the later claimed millions and millions.

2262
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:32,320
Another lie that became popular after the war

2263
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:38,080
was that the nuclear bomb was dropped in response to Japan ignoring the Potsdam Declaration.

2264
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:41,120
However, the only existing direct order to go ahead

2265
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:43,440
with the use of the nuclear bombs against Japan

2266
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:46,400
was issued prior to the Potsdam Declaration.

2267
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:49,600
Not by Truman, of course, he didn't have anything to do with it.

2268
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:53,520
It was drafted by Leslie Groves, approved by Henry Stimson,

2269
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:55,600
and delivered to General Karl Spatz,

2270
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:59,840
commander of the Strategic Air Forces, on July the 25th,

2271
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:03,040
the day before the Potsdam Declaration was issued.

2272
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:05,120
They did not wait for a response

2273
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:08,240
before issuing the order to proceed with the atomic bombings.

2274
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:12,880
The order was issued before Japan had even seen the surrender terms.

2275
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:15,520
As a result of these lies and others,

2276
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:19,440
the simplified version of the history came into existence.

2277
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:22,240
And it isn't hard to understand why this caught on.

2278
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:28,000
Firstly, it took me two minutes at the top of the video to explain the easy lie,

2279
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:32,160
and the whole rest of the video to explain the much more complicated truth.

2280
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:38,320
The bombs versus invasion narrative is simple, it's plausible, and it's easy to understand.

2281
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:43,760
It isn't true, of course, but why let that get in the way of a good story?

2282
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:47,360
But the invasion narrative is not just easier to understand,

2283
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:49,360
it's also easier to accept.

2284
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:54,800
Because if we question it, we have to contend with the possibility, or the certainty,

2285
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,960
that the United States of America

2286
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:02,160
incinerated two cities full of innocent civilians for no good reason.

2287
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:04,080
Given the enormous death toll,

2288
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:08,960
the truth, that the use of the bombs was pointless and accomplished nothing,

2289
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:11,280
is very difficult to accept.

2290
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:14,480
Now, it's about time for me to conclude this video here.

2291
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:17,520
And trying to neatly sum up such a complicated event

2292
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:21,120
with so many actors all with their own contradictory motivations

2293
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:23,600
is surely an exercise in frustration.

2294
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:25,600
There is no doing it justice.

2295
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:29,600
That said, the nuclear bombs used against Japan

2296
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:32,640
were an expensive gamble that did not pay off.

2297
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:35,600
They were dropped on civilians, intentionally,

2298
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:38,320
per the flawed strategy of morale bombing,

2299
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:41,040
to force Japan to surrender unconditionally

2300
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:43,520
before the Soviet Union joined the war.

2301
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:46,800
In this, they were a complete failure.

2302
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:50,560
The lie that the bombs were used only to avert an invasion of Japan

2303
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:52,640
was a post-war construction,

2304
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:56,560
intended to provide justification for a completely avoidable

2305
02:16:56,560 --> 02:17:00,320
and indefensible slaughter of innocent civilians.

2306
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:03,200
The civilians who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki

2307
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:06,800
were not killed to avert an invasion of Japan,

2308
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:11,600
nor did they bravely give their lives in sacrifice to save their empire.

2309
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:14,480
Their deaths were entirely unnecessary,

2310
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:16,800
and we owe it to them to admit that.

2311
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:19,840
Often, when terrible injustices

2312
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:22,720
towards the inhabitants of one country are discussed,

2313
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:24,080
the response will come,

2314
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:26,560
well, what about all the terrible injustices

2315
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:29,200
carried out by that country to other people?

2316
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:32,480
This is a question that has varying motivations behind it

2317
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:34,640
of varying legitimacy.

2318
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:37,920
On the one hand, certain events from the Second World War,

2319
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:40,400
and wider history in general, I suppose,

2320
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:43,040
do get much more attention and discussion,

2321
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:44,320
for whatever reasons,

2322
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:46,960
than other events of equal importance.

2323
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:50,000
And it is perfectly valid to ask that we do not forget

2324
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,280
that Imperial Japan committed many terrible war crimes

2325
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:55,840
and was, both during and before the war,

2326
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:59,840
a brutal totalitarian oppressor of many different people.

2327
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,080
I think it's very important to make clear here

2328
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:03,840
that nothing we've talked about today

2329
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:06,160
should generate any sympathy whatsoever

2330
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,800
for Imperial Japan as a concept

2331
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:12,880
or the leadership of the Imperial Japanese government or military.

2332
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:15,840
The crimes of the Empire of Japan were dreadful,

2333
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:19,360
and there is no punishment that perpetrators would not deserve.

2334
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:21,840
And many of these crimes, it is worth pointing out,

2335
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:24,480
have went either ignored or unapologized for

2336
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:27,120
by the Japanese government to this day.

2337
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:28,560
All that being said,

2338
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:32,400
we must be careful to accurately allocate fault here.

2339
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:34,960
Because unfortunately, that same question,

2340
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:37,120
what about all the stuff they did,

2341
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:40,160
is not always asked with such innocent intentions.

2342
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:43,600
Sometimes this question reveals something very worrisome,

2343
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:46,000
and that's the belief in racial crimes

2344
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,840
that can be avenged with violence

2345
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:50,080
towards other members of that group.

2346
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:53,840
And this is the worst sort of us versus them thinking.

2347
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:57,120
They did something bad to us, so they,

2348
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:00,640
and by they I mean anyone I reckon is in that group,

2349
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:03,360
deserves something bad in return.

2350
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:06,160
So while we should have no sympathy whatsoever

2351
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:08,000
for the Empire of Japan,

2352
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,960
the schoolchildren of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

2353
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:13,520
were not the Empire of Japan.

2354
02:19:13,520 --> 02:19:15,520
They were some schoolchildren.

2355
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:18,080
They had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor.

2356
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:20,800
They did not consent to go to war.

2357
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:23,840
They were needlessly put in danger by one power,

2358
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,920
and needlessly killed by another.

2359
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:28,880
Nothing was avenged or paid back.

2360
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,320
There was no point to it,

2361
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:32,320
but to provide yet more evidence

2362
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:35,520
that there's no monopoly held by any nation or race

2363
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:38,480
on a disregard for the lives of the powerless.

2364
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:41,760
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

2365
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:43,200
