0	7160	Hello everyone. Um, so I hit 10,000 subscribers on YouTube yesterday, which, um,
7160	12420	it's just another number really, isn't it? But, uh, whatever, it's a nice round milestone.
12420	16380	So I've decided to do a little question and answer video just as a little extra
16380	20080	before I get back to, uh, whatever else it is I do.
20080	24140	Um, an anonymous user asks,
24140	30280	Do you think with the growing popularity of yourself, Hbomber, Contra, and Tomavella, and others,
30280	34840	you might be able to rival the skeptic community in popularity?
34840	41540	Uh, well, yes. Yeah. In a lot of cases, we already do.
41540	46880	I mean, there are bigger channels than any of those names there that put out similar content to us,
46880	50680	and there are a lot of skeptic channels that aren't doing so well recently.
50840	58440	Um, but even the biggest skeptic channels, remember, their sub-numbers are a bit of a- a bit of a con.
58440	63040	Like, if you look at, um, the AmazenAtheist, say, he's got a million subscribers,
63040	66360	but he doesn't get a million views on his videos, does he? It's just,
66360	70760	their channels have been around for a lot longer than us, so they- they've accrued a lot of, uh,
70760	77000	a lot of dead subscribers. Not literally dead. Although I guess a few of them are probably dead.
77160	80480	One of- at least one of my subscribers has probably died.
81040	82040	Bit morbid.
82040	88200	Um, but yeah, if you just- if you look on view counts, like, we're gettin' there.
88200	92800	Uh, plus we're gonna benefit from the political swing over the course of, uh,
92800	98600	Trump's, uh, term in office. Or terms in office, if we live in the dark timeline.
98600	106600	You know, broadly, there's always a- a swing of the moderates away from whatever the politics of the American president are over the course of his term.
106680	109640	Uh, so, in short, yes.
109640	111640	Bandit asks,
111640	115160	What do you think led to a rise in subs so fast?
115160	121160	I remember finding you completely by fluke after the Leafy video, and seeing this change is bizarre.
121160	126360	Uh, well, thank you, Bandit, for the, uh, possibly insulting question there.
126360	128360	Um, I don't really know either.
128360	134120	Uh, my channel's been growing a lot faster than some other channels that are similar to mine, but better.
134200	137560	Uh, so I don't really know what's going on, to be perfectly honest.
137560	143400	I've got a lot of very helpful, uh, shout-outs by said people who are better than me.
143400	149240	Uh, so, thanks a lot for those. It's probably just all of those, and not anything that I've actually done.
149240	151480	An anonymous user asks,
151480	155160	What steps do you do to ensure your videos are quality?
155160	157800	Well, I would never call my videos quality.
157800	163400	Uh, but I put this question in here, uh, because I wanna mention something about my last video I put out.
163400	172600	So, uh, that video about, uh, Sargon's This Week in Stupid series, um, in the writing process of that one,
172600	174600	I made a really big error.
174600	182200	Uh, I, uh, misheard something that Sargon said, and then accused him of something that wasn't true, and didn't notice.
182200	189080	And I listened to the audio through, didn't notice it, and it was at the end of the editing process that I actually noticed,
189080	191240	Oh, wait, hang on, I've made a mistake there.
191240	197800	But it's only because I did so many checks, four mistakes like that, that I caught it and could cut it out.
197800	202680	You can't do that if you're just pumping out one of those videos every day.
202680	208280	Because, of course, Sargon can make four of those videos in the time it takes me to fact-check one of them,
208280	212440	and, of course, we all make mistakes, so that's how mistakes get through.
212440	218040	If you just get content out as quickly as possible, then you are gonna make mistakes.
218040	224840	Uh, so, I guess I'd say, even though I don't think my videos are very good anyway, uh, taking my time with them.
224840	230120	How do you define your political views? asks someone else who's anonymous.
230120	232120	No one's sent in names with these.
232120	238200	Um, I don't want you to label yourself as anything, I just want to understand your ideology.
238200	240200	Sorry if this is a bad, boring question.
240200	245080	It's not a bad or boring question. In fact, I got this question more than anything else.
245160	245960	So, I should-
245960	250040	Heh, heh, heh. I got, like, ten people asking me this.
250040	255880	Um, so, broadly, I don't use, uh, political labels for things.
255880	259000	Uh, just because I personally find them a bit unhelpful.
259000	264120	Uh, when pushed, I'll call myself, uh, an anti-capitalist.
264120	270520	Uh, but even that's a bit of a dodge, really, and then if you push me even further than that, I'll probably say I'm a socialist.
270520	271800	But I should explain.
271880	283000	When you say socialist to two different people, one of them will think of a, you know, wonderful egalitarian Star Trek utopia.
283000	287080	And the other one will think of Stalin putting them in a gulag.
287080	291880	So, this is why I sort of find these- these labels sort of unhelpful.
291880	297000	The reason I go to anti-capitalist first is because I think there's a lot of problems with capitalism,
297000	301960	and I think it's not getting a proper critique.
301960	305080	Or it's never questioned by anyone who's in power in the West.
305720	307400	Um, and it needs to be.
307400	312040	You know, if you have only two political parties in the country that can ever get into power,
312040	318040	and the only way they can get into power is by never ever saying anything questioning of capitalism,
318040	320920	then that leads to a lot of problems.
321000	327240	Especially considering there are sort of systemic, inherent problems with capitalism.
327800	335240	And they never get dealt with just because there's nobody on the political stage who's, you know, allowed to deal with them.
335880	342920	And to people who automatically, uh, jump to the defense of capitalism, which I understand, you know,
342920	347880	somebody says capitalism's bad, they say, well, what would you replace it with?
347880	351800	What's better? You know, this has never worked out, that's never worked out, what are you gonna do?
352360	354920	It's the best thing we've ever had, etc.
354920	357640	I think that sort of misses the point.
357640	364680	Even if you think capitalism is sort of the end goal of progress in, you know, human society,
365240	369720	it's still a flawed system, and it still needs critiquing.
369720	372760	I think you should welcome the critique, because it helps it get better.
373400	377720	Even within capitalism, it's good to criticize capitalism.
377720	381000	Now, one of the reasons I think it's important to criticize capitalism
381000	386040	is it's taken the old sort of power dynamic that's been there throughout human history,
386040	391960	which is just, you know, the rich ruling over the poor, the powerful ruling over the less powerful,
391960	394360	and it's, uh, made it global.
394360	398680	So now you can live in the West in relative luxury,
398680	407400	and some poor bastard in China has to live basically as a slave to produce the goods that you consume.
407480	410760	And it's made it very difficult to fight against.
410760	415960	It's easy if you're just, you know, you're all the villagers in a town ruled over by a king.
415960	418440	You can see the oppression, it's right there in front of you,
419080	425080	but capitalism sort of globalized the oppression and spread it out so distantly,
425800	427800	that it's difficult to really organize against.
428600	431960	This is why I think if we are ever to move past capitalism,
431960	436760	it would have to be sort of a simultaneous global movement.
437400	440040	And that's why social justice is so important to me,
440040	445240	because it sort of erases barriers between people using empathy.
446440	451080	If you can get, you know, native-born people to sympathize with immigrants
451080	453800	who are really in the same economic boat that they are,
453800	456280	you know, if you can get men to empathize with women,
457400	461880	you know, people of all races to empathize with each other, etc.,
461880	466520	then you can get them all on the same economic team as well.
466520	470680	Well, I want to make clear here, I don't fi- I'm not just using it as a means to an end.
470680	475240	I'm not like, yeah, I'll support gay marriage because I want that fight to be over
475240	479080	so we can have the real, you know, economic fight.
479080	480280	I'm not saying that.
480280	485160	I think, you know, even within capitalism, ignoring the economic aspects of it,
485160	488120	it'd still be good to fight for all these social justice causes,
488120	491080	because they're worthwhile in and of themselves.
491080	496040	You know, there's sometimes a little bit of dissension among leftists over whether or not,
496040	499240	you know, social justice is, quote, worth it.
499240	503000	Like, you know, should we spend our time, you know, talking about this,
503000	506600	because, of course, that problem will go away if we just get rid of capitalism.
506600	508280	I think that's the wrong way to look at it.
508280	513640	I think it's- they're all really just reflections of the same problem,
513640	520120	which is just a lack of empathy causing people to want to rule over other people.
520120	522600	This is why I usually script videos, by the way,
522600	527080	because I go off the rails and end up trying to talk about everything at once.
527080	528040	Right, more questions.
537960	539160	That's from Mikey there.
539800	543400	Jen did a thumbnail for the last video,
543400	547640	which now hopefully that's her job and she does the rest of the thumbnails, but we'll see.
548200	552440	But no, Jen is a lot more involved in our Friday Twitch stream.
553160	556360	The reason that the YouTube channel's called Sean and Jen is because
556360	559720	she used to be involved in the YouTube content,
559720	565720	but then she got kind of busy for a while last year and then couldn't carry on with that,
565720	567560	so I just sort of took it over by myself.
568200	572600	And then completely unrelated to that, that's where we really took off, you know.
573160	578280	Um, so we were both in the videos and we got about 10 or 20 views on average,
578840	582680	and then Jen went and then we started getting thousands of views on average.
583400	585960	Um, now, is that related?
585960	586460	I don't know.
587080	587880	Who's to say?
589240	591800	What are a few of your all-time favorite books
592440	595400	or books that have had the most influence on your worldview?
595400	599720	To make it fun, at least one fiction and one non-fiction, please.
599720	601080	From Alvy.
601960	606760	I always get made fun of when I say my favorite book, which is Ulysses by James Joyce,
606760	610440	because people think I'm just trying to be clever
610440	616680	by saying my favorite book is what's considered one of the greatest novels of all time.
617400	619000	But it's... it's not.
619000	620520	It's... I like it.
620520	624920	It's my favorite book, and everyone... everyone can leave me alone, frankly.
625720	628280	Now, my favorite non-fiction book that I own,
628280	633640	and one of my favorite books of all time is a photo book called City of Darkness,
634520	640120	which details life inside Kowloon Walled City.
640120	641400	And if you don't know what that is,
642040	647000	you should go and read the Wikipedia page on it because it's absolutely fascinating.
647880	650600	Why is it that the people you respond to in your videos
650600	655880	often seem so much more interested in winning than learning or growing?
655880	661800	Well, basically, it's not in their financial interests to learn or grow.
661800	664840	If you look at someone like Behring, say, you know,
664840	668440	he's got a lot more subscribers than he gets video views.
668440	674120	It's because not all of his subs watch his videos, obviously, because they grew up.
674120	678520	Like, his target audience is sort of a revolving door
678520	683320	of people who are at a certain mentality, shall we say.
683320	685160	And he has to keep pandering to that,
686360	692280	because it's very hard to take what Behring does and, you know, grow it, make it more mature.
692280	698360	So he just has to keep targeting the exact same sort of middle-teenage,
698360	702280	I'm-very-clever-and-everyone-else-is-dumb sort of mentality.
702280	704360	And it's in his financial interest to do that.
704360	710360	Like, he can't stop, or he'll not be able to pay his rent,
710360	713560	which is another problem with capitalism, ultimately.
713560	714060	Yeah.
714600	717320	C.P. Fazor says,
729880	730920	Yeah, I could do that.
730920	733880	I haven't actually looked into anyone else other than Leafy,
735000	737320	but I've had quite a few names suggested to me,
737320	743160	so that could certainly be an upcoming video or series of videos.
743160	744680	I need to look into them.
744680	748280	Someone, actually, who hears this, just send me, like, a list of them.
748280	750920	Send, like, you know, five, the five biggest ones.
751800	758360	This is how I'm actually chilling for help in my own Q&A video, right.
759000	759880	Milk says,
761480	764040	Um, possibly twice.
764040	766120	Never intentionally, actually,
766120	768440	but there've been a couple of times where weed's been in the room
768440	771320	and I've gotten so drunk that I can't remember what I did,
771320	774440	so... maybe I have, I can't remember.
774440	780040	Um, is it okay for non-Liverpool natives to use the term Scouser?
780600	783080	Uh, yeah, I don't see why not.
783080	784600	I've never had any issue with it.
784600	787320	I mean, Scouse isn't even from Liverpool, really,
787320	792840	so we kinda nicked that from somewhere else to begin with, um, as we do.
792840	794760	So, yeah. Go nuts.
794840	802920	Um, partially, although, aren't we all.
802920	805080	Someone else who's anonymous asks,
811560	815400	Uh, well, I think they almost get a lot of things.
815400	820520	They just, they identify real problems, but then come to the wrong conclusions.
820600	824520	For instance, they look at, say, the migrant crisis
824520	827560	and see all these problems associated with it,
827560	831880	um, and then their conclusion is to, you know, put up walls,
832840	833640	deport people,
834520	839320	things which I think will make it worse than it is now, you know.
839320	841160	And if you try and critique that and say,
841160	843000	well, no, actually, that will make it worse,
843000	845160	they say you're ignoring the problem,
845160	848280	um, because, of course, they have to have a monopoly
848360	850600	on being the only ones who can see the problem.
851480	854680	It's as if they think just by identifying that something is wrong,
854680	857880	then they automatically know what to do to fix it.
866600	867560	I love Columbo.
867560	872280	I think it's a great twist on the classic murder mystery format.
872280	874120	I really like the character.
874120	877960	I like that he's, like, some working class.
878440	885560	And all of his cases involve murderers who are much better off than him
885560	887080	and think they're a lot smarter than him.
887800	890040	And it's very formulaic, of course,
890760	894040	and it's occasionally a little bit contrived in its logic,
894040	897000	but it's typically really satisfying to watch.
897720	899480	I don't know if I could do a video on it
899480	903400	because I've basically just said all of my opinions about it right there.
903400	904280	So there you go.
904280	906120	That was my Columbo video.
906120	907880	Another anonymous person says,
907880	911400	how do you respond to people who come from the videos of your detractors
911400	914440	who harass you and not actually watch your videos?
914440	917560	Oh, by not caring about it, to be honest.
918120	919880	Um, that's obvious.
919880	922120	You know, someone makes a video about me,
922120	925560	then I, you know, my average watch time and like bar
925560	927800	are gonna be shot to shit for a couple of weeks.
928440	931000	But it's no issue, is it?
931000	935880	Someone told me that YouTube waits all of this stuff just by interaction,
935880	939240	so even dislikes aren't really a problem.
939240	942840	It's not like they drop you out of the suggested videos or anything,
942840	945480	so I'm not too bothered, to be honest.
945480	949560	What's your approach to dealing with negative response videos?
949560	952280	Do you just move on and ignore them or something else?
952280	955240	Well, I watched them just to make sure I didn't get caught out
955240	957960	on something that was, you know, obviously wrong.
957960	959880	And then after that, I just ignored them.
959880	963400	I'm not interested in getting into some video back and forth
963400	969080	with, say, Sargon made one about my last video about him
969080	971960	where he sort of did little riff tracks on my video
971960	974680	and just watched it through, shouting that I'm stupid and so on.
974680	977640	And there's nothing I can say back to that, you know.
977640	982200	I couldn't watch his video through and pause every time he said I'm an idiot
982200	984760	and go, actually, it is you who's the idiot.
984760	987640	You know, it's maybe on Twitter every now and then.
987640	992520	I'll have a bit of a sassy day, but not in videos.
992520	994520	Did you go to university?
994520	996520	If so, what did you major in?
996520	999320	We've got an American writing in, ladies and gentlemen.
1000200	1001880	Thoughts on your college experience?
1001880	1003320	I did go to university.
1003320	1008600	I studied creative writing, although study is a bit of a stretch.
1008600	1011880	I mainly was at university in name only.
1011880	1013560	I didn't really attend all that much.
1015000	1020600	I mainly just used the time to get really drunk for a couple of years.
1021160	1023480	Um, so it was pretty fun.
1023480	1026520	All around, I'd highly recommend it.
1026520	1029560	Waymoo asks, one, where are my shoelaces?
1029560	1033160	Two, what happened to that response video you did to The Amazing Atheist?
1033160	1034440	I thought it was great and I miss it.
1035320	1039080	So your shoelaces are probably on your shoes.
1039800	1041320	You know, that's where I check first.
1042520	1045960	The Amazing Atheist video, it's annoying that,
1045960	1048280	because I caught him out on something really funny,
1048280	1053800	but I elsewhere speculated that he was crazy or in some way mentally ill,
1055080	1059800	which was wrong of me to do, I realize.
1059800	1064120	You know, regardless of how right or wrong I might be about that,
1064120	1069560	I approached it in a very indelicate manner that sort of directly connected
1069560	1077480	The Amazing Atheist's sort of horrible racist fuse to just any sort of mental illness.
1077480	1080440	And I didn't want to do that because, of course, there's a lot of people out there
1081000	1083560	who struggle with the mental health,
1083560	1087720	and that doesn't automatically mean they're horrible, you know, racist bastards.
1087720	1092760	So a couple of people wrote in saying they were uncomfortable with that,
1092760	1095400	and then after thinking about it, I realized I was as well.
1096280	1098040	So I just took the video down.
1098600	1101560	And I keep saying I'll re-edit it sometime, but meh.
1102360	1105720	I don't even want to look at it now, basically.
1106680	1111560	Do you think the skeptic community will begin to break ranks on the anti-SJW stuff
1111560	1113560	and start focusing on Republicans
1113560	1116920	simply because of how easy a target the Trump administration is?
1116920	1120120	I feel like someone looking for an easy target could do a weekly series
1120120	1124120	debunking Trump for the next four years and not ever run out of material.
1125160	1126840	Well, that's an interesting thing, isn't it?
1126840	1132200	I feel like, like with R. Tory politicians with Brexit,
1132200	1135320	a lot of them would have sort of preferred Hillary to win.
1136520	1138920	Because then they'd get an easy four more years
1139480	1144680	complaining about all the evil SJW leftists being in charge of society,
1144680	1148200	which they're still doing now, even though it doesn't really make any sense.
1148760	1153000	Like, Trump got into office and is in power now,
1153000	1156120	but they're still sitting around on YouTube complaining
1156120	1158200	that a feminist said something stupid.
1158200	1160680	And it's funny when you see one of them occasionally be like,
1161240	1165800	Wait until my subscribers get a load of me making fun of Trump.
1165800	1168280	Oh, they'll see I'm not just some right-winger.
1168280	1171080	I can- I can go after the conservatives as well.
1172120	1173240	Yeah, but do they?
1174120	1175320	Not really.
1175320	1178520	Do you think that the media calling white people racist
1178520	1181080	has led to a rise in white nationalism,
1181080	1183880	i.e. people are more willing to stand up for being white
1183880	1187560	and therefore be racist to other people in a shocking turn of events?
1187560	1190280	Um, no, actually.
1190280	1195640	I think the recent rise in white nationalism
1195640	1199240	and sort of more open racism
1199240	1203880	is more to do with the economic climate over the last decade.
1203880	1207960	Of course, you know, you get these periods occasionally under capitalism.
1207960	1210120	That's one of the other problems with capitalism.
1211160	1214440	There's boom and bust cycles, and that's normal.
1214440	1215880	That's not an aberration.
1215880	1218760	It's important to understand that in a capitalist system,
1218760	1220840	like, we have this happens.
1221720	1223080	It has to, you know.
1223960	1228760	And when that happens, people start looking for solutions
1229320	1233160	and they don't always correctly identify the problem
1233160	1234840	and they come to the wrong conclusions.
1234840	1236120	Like, it's easy to say,
1236120	1239160	Well, people are struggling to find work
1239160	1242200	and all these immigrants are coming over here taking all of our jobs.
1242760	1246120	Um, but that's not the problem, really.
1246120	1251240	The problem is that you live in a system in which there is a scarcity of jobs.
1251240	1256840	You know, I was actually in a truck 10 years ago with my dad,
1256840	1258040	who's a truck driver,
1258040	1264120	and we were listening to a news story about the then very recent economic crash
1264120	1266840	and there was a lot of, quote, experts,
1267560	1271960	like, ruminating over the extent of how bad this was.
1272280	1276520	Is this a sort of economy-ending crash
1276520	1279000	or is it one that we'll recover from fairly quickly?
1279960	1283000	And while they were talking about it, my dad said to me,
1283000	1283960	You watch now.
1283960	1287800	Over the next few years, everyone's going to become a lot more racist.
1287800	1288920	And I said, Why?
1288920	1293080	And he said, Well, when this happens, people start looking for someone to blame.
1293640	1296120	And it's the most prescient thing he's ever said to me
1296120	1299560	and it's been completely borne out in reality.
1299560	1302680	Killer Rubarb, I think that's how you say that, says,
1302680	1306120	Why are anti-feminists so quick to dismiss the wage gap
1306120	1309320	as just an average that doesn't take things into account?
1309320	1310680	Of course it's an average,
1310680	1314040	but those things it doesn't take into account could be inherently sexist.
1314040	1316760	Like, why do women choose to take lower-paying jobs?
1316760	1318040	Is it because they want them
1318040	1321080	or because it's harder to get into STEM fields and programming?
1322040	1322760	Yeah, of course.
1322760	1326840	Well, anti-fems typically just look at everything legally.
1326840	1329560	They say, Well, you know, we freed the slaves
1329560	1333640	and we gave black people the vote, so now racism is pretty much over.
1334280	1336920	Women have legal equality with men now,
1336920	1339640	so of course there's no more issue, is there?
1339640	1345000	They sort of willfully can't see the systemic aspects of it, you know?
1345000	1348840	Like, you can remove the legal barriers for women getting into these professions,
1348840	1351800	but that doesn't mean you remove the social barriers
1351800	1353880	for women getting into those professions.
1353880	1357320	You know, if those professions are more likely to hire men than women,
1357320	1360040	just based upon the fact that they're men,
1360040	1361080	you know, that's an issue,
1361080	1365720	and it's not one that can be very easily solved legally, you know,
1365720	1367960	except for imposing quotas and the like,
1368680	1372760	which I don't think the anti-fems are much of a fan of, really.
1372760	1374760	Do you think people should be held accountable
1374760	1378600	for deciding not to get involved when someone they are associated with
1378600	1381800	starts parroting white nationalist talking points,
1381800	1385000	e.g. all the YouTubers who have collaborated with JonTron?
1386520	1388920	That's from Cheeky there.
1388920	1391480	I'm more concerned with holding accountable people
1391480	1395160	who didn't just not get involved but came out in support of them.
1395160	1396600	I mean, they're the real...
1396600	1398360	They're rarely who are at fault here.
1399960	1401400	As for not getting involved,
1401400	1403880	I think I certainly wouldn't blame someone
1403880	1407000	for having a problem with someone avoiding that issue.
1407000	1408120	I mean, you know,
1408840	1413080	white nationalism isn't something you really want to beat around the bush on,
1413080	1413720	is it?
1413720	1416840	It shouldn't be difficult to come out and say,
1416840	1421560	I don't agree with white nationalism or racism.
1421560	1425240	But apparently, you know, that's where we are in 2017,
1426200	1427240	in the current year.
1428040	1432120	Who is your favorite Roman emperor and why is it Caligula?
1432120	1433480	Signed, Caligula.
1433480	1438040	Well, it's not Caligula, because he was an insane murderer.
1439080	1441960	My favorite Roman emperor is Claudius,
1443320	1448200	who is very interesting and everyone should go read about on Wikipedia.
1448200	1450280	I won't talk about Claudius for too long,
1450280	1454040	and I could, because he's very interesting.
1454040	1458440	But basically, he was part of Augustus,
1458440	1462360	that's the first emperor of Rome's royal family,
1462360	1464200	and he had some sort of medical issue,
1464200	1470360	which modern historians think is cerebral palsy or Tourette's or something like that.
1471720	1474920	He struggled to speak and he walked with a limp
1474920	1477880	and his family sort of kept him out of the limelight
1477880	1480680	and didn't really let the public see him.
1480680	1483560	So he just became a scholar and he read a lot.
1483560	1486920	And then after Caligula really went off the deep end
1486920	1488440	and declared himself a god,
1488440	1491640	and everyone just figured it would be better to kill him,
1492520	1497000	there was a coup and they killed Caligula and his whole family.
1497000	1501240	And the only one that they left alive was Claudius,
1501960	1503400	who they declared the emperor,
1503400	1506760	because of course the troops still needed an emperor to be on the throne
1506760	1508200	so that they could get paid.
1508200	1509960	They didn't want to put the Senate back in charge
1509960	1512840	and then they, you know, dissolve all of the troops' power.
1513800	1517560	So Claudius just sort of randomly ended up as the emperor
1517560	1518680	and everyone thought,
1518680	1521800	oh god, we've got a mad fool as an emperor.
1521880	1527000	But he actually turned out to be a really capable administrator.
1528840	1532920	It was like a big surprise twist.
1532920	1536600	If anyone's ever watched Game of Thrones,
1536600	1539160	I don't know if you've ever heard of that show Game of Thrones,
1540920	1547640	the character of Tyrion Lannister is based rather heavily on Claudius,
1547640	1551160	as Joffrey is on Caligula, I believe.
1551240	1554040	What are some of your interests outside of making video?
1554040	1556760	I believe you mentioned playing Warcraft and liking action movies.
1556760	1560360	That's from ShadowTheLincolnParkHog666.
1561240	1565240	Now I've paired this one with another question to come at the end of the video.
1565240	1569960	Hi Sean, I wanted to know your thoughts on the current World of Warcraft expansion.
1569960	1571880	Are you a fan of the Demon Hunter class?
1571880	1574280	Thoughts on Illidan, characters being killed off,
1574280	1576360	Gul'dan ETC from Gavi.
1576360	1579000	Now I'll put this one at the end because if I did this one first,
1579000	1581320	then, you know, everyone would click the video off.
1583000	1584760	I do play Warcraft on and off.
1585320	1587000	I can't consistently play it.
1587640	1588920	It can't hold me for that long.
1588920	1592040	I play for a couple of weeks every few months, pretty much,
1592040	1593960	just to see all the new stuff that's in the game.
1594760	1596760	I'm not like a progression raider or something.
1597800	1602280	The current expansion made a lot of improvements over the last expansion.
1602280	1606920	The last one, Draenor, is the worst the game's ever been by a long shot.
1606920	1611320	This one fixed a lot of those problems, but carried on a lot of those problems.
1611880	1617720	The class halls are a major improvement over the Garrison of the Last expansion,
1617720	1619560	which was, like, the main reason it was rubbish.
1620440	1623800	Demon Hunters, I haven't- I've only played through the start area.
1623800	1625000	They seem fine.
1625560	1627320	I don't know, I don't have much to say about this.
1628120	1632520	Illidan, well, of course, that's where they've really went wrong story-wise.
1633160	1636760	They got rid of Froll, who was, for the uninitiated,
1637880	1642520	Froll was like the Mary Sue of Chris Metzen within the World of Warcraft.
1642520	1645960	He was orc Jesus, he typically gets referred to as,
1646680	1652600	and was responsible or involved with every single major plot element in the entire game
1652600	1656840	and would turn up when your raid group had just finished fighting a boss
1656840	1661480	and he'd get the last kill in, or you'd be fighting another major lore character
1661480	1665960	and then the game would just make you lose so that Froll could come and save you.
1665960	1669800	And everyone hated Froll, so they just sort of benched him.
1670760	1675080	But now they've replaced him with Illidan, who was always an interesting character
1675880	1682280	in that he was pretty much just some average elf who was really incredibly driven
1682840	1689000	and now they've made him elf Jesus, who was predestined to blah blah blah blah blah.
1689000	1692040	And it's all incredibly boring and contrived.
1692040	1697400	Like, for what a mess Warcraft's story is, there are occasionally good elements to it
1697400	1701080	and Illidan's story was one of those and now they've ruined it.
1701080	1704040	As for the characters who have been killed off, I think that was good.
1704040	1710760	It gave a sense of actual, like, threat to the antagonists of this expansion.
1710760	1715400	I mean, the orcs in the last expansion, they didn't kill anyone, I don't think,
1715400	1718120	apart from characters who had just been introduced.
1718120	1719960	They were, like, immediately beaten.
1719960	1724680	But in this one, the Legion turn up and kill off a whole bunch of named lore characters.
1724680	1727320	It's like, oh, actually, this is a threat this time.
1727320	1730440	Um, so that was, uh, no one's still here, are they?
1730440	1734360	Uh, so, okay, Gabi, since you're the only person who's still listening at this point.
1734360	1736520	Heh heh heh heh.
1736520	1737800	Thanks a lot for that question.
1738680	1741800	Um, thanks a lot to everyone else who asked questions.
1741800	1745720	Um, I couldn't put them all in, but any that I didn't answer here,
1745720	1747720	I'll have a go at answering on Curious Cats.
1748120	1751480	So, thanks a lot, everyone, and I'll see you next time.
