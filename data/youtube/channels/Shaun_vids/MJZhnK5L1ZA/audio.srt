00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
Hello everyone. Um, so I hit 10,000 subscribers on YouTube yesterday, which, um,

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,420
it's just another number really, isn't it? But, uh, whatever, it's a nice round milestone.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,380
So I've decided to do a little question and answer video just as a little extra

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,080
before I get back to, uh, whatever else it is I do.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,140
Um, an anonymous user asks,

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,280
Do you think with the growing popularity of yourself, Hbomber, Contra, and Tomavella, and others,

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,840
you might be able to rival the skeptic community in popularity?

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,540
Uh, well, yes. Yeah. In a lot of cases, we already do.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,880
I mean, there are bigger channels than any of those names there that put out similar content to us,

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,680
and there are a lot of skeptic channels that aren't doing so well recently.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:58,440
Um, but even the biggest skeptic channels, remember, their sub-numbers are a bit of a- a bit of a con.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,040
Like, if you look at, um, the AmazenAtheist, say, he's got a million subscribers,

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,360
but he doesn't get a million views on his videos, does he? It's just,

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,760
their channels have been around for a lot longer than us, so they- they've accrued a lot of, uh,

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,000
a lot of dead subscribers. Not literally dead. Although I guess a few of them are probably dead.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,480
One of- at least one of my subscribers has probably died.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
Bit morbid.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,200
Um, but yeah, if you just- if you look on view counts, like, we're gettin' there.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,800
Uh, plus we're gonna benefit from the political swing over the course of, uh,

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,600
Trump's, uh, term in office. Or terms in office, if we live in the dark timeline.

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:46,600
You know, broadly, there's always a- a swing of the moderates away from whatever the politics of the American president are over the course of his term.

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,640
Uh, so, in short, yes.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Bandit asks,

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,160
What do you think led to a rise in subs so fast?

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,160
I remember finding you completely by fluke after the Leafy video, and seeing this change is bizarre.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,360
Uh, well, thank you, Bandit, for the, uh, possibly insulting question there.

27
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Um, I don't really know either.

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,120
Uh, my channel's been growing a lot faster than some other channels that are similar to mine, but better.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,560
Uh, so I don't really know what's going on, to be perfectly honest.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,400
I've got a lot of very helpful, uh, shout-outs by said people who are better than me.

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,240
Uh, so, thanks a lot for those. It's probably just all of those, and not anything that I've actually done.

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,480
An anonymous user asks,

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,160
What steps do you do to ensure your videos are quality?

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,800
Well, I would never call my videos quality.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,400
Uh, but I put this question in here, uh, because I wanna mention something about my last video I put out.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:52,600
So, uh, that video about, uh, Sargon's This Week in Stupid series, um, in the writing process of that one,

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I made a really big error.

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:02,200
Uh, I, uh, misheard something that Sargon said, and then accused him of something that wasn't true, and didn't notice.

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,080
And I listened to the audio through, didn't notice it, and it was at the end of the editing process that I actually noticed,

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,240
Oh, wait, hang on, I've made a mistake there.

41
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,800
But it's only because I did so many checks, four mistakes like that, that I caught it and could cut it out.

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,680
You can't do that if you're just pumping out one of those videos every day.

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,280
Because, of course, Sargon can make four of those videos in the time it takes me to fact-check one of them,

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,440
and, of course, we all make mistakes, so that's how mistakes get through.

45
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,040
If you just get content out as quickly as possible, then you are gonna make mistakes.

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,840
Uh, so, I guess I'd say, even though I don't think my videos are very good anyway, uh, taking my time with them.

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,120
How do you define your political views? asks someone else who's anonymous.

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
No one's sent in names with these.

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,200
Um, I don't want you to label yourself as anything, I just want to understand your ideology.

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Sorry if this is a bad, boring question.

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,080
It's not a bad or boring question. In fact, I got this question more than anything else.

52
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,960
So, I should-

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,040
Heh, heh, heh. I got, like, ten people asking me this.

54
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,880
Um, so, broadly, I don't use, uh, political labels for things.

55
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,000
Uh, just because I personally find them a bit unhelpful.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,120
Uh, when pushed, I'll call myself, uh, an anti-capitalist.

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,520
Uh, but even that's a bit of a dodge, really, and then if you push me even further than that, I'll probably say I'm a socialist.

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,800
But I should explain.

59
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:43,000
When you say socialist to two different people, one of them will think of a, you know, wonderful egalitarian Star Trek utopia.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,080
And the other one will think of Stalin putting them in a gulag.

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,880
So, this is why I sort of find these- these labels sort of unhelpful.

62
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,000
The reason I go to anti-capitalist first is because I think there's a lot of problems with capitalism,

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,960
and I think it's not getting a proper critique.

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,080
Or it's never questioned by anyone who's in power in the West.

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,400
Um, and it needs to be.

66
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,040
You know, if you have only two political parties in the country that can ever get into power,

67
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,040
and the only way they can get into power is by never ever saying anything questioning of capitalism,

68
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,920
then that leads to a lot of problems.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,240
Especially considering there are sort of systemic, inherent problems with capitalism.

70
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:35,240
And they never get dealt with just because there's nobody on the political stage who's, you know, allowed to deal with them.

71
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,920
And to people who automatically, uh, jump to the defense of capitalism, which I understand, you know,

72
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,880
somebody says capitalism's bad, they say, well, what would you replace it with?

73
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,800
What's better? You know, this has never worked out, that's never worked out, what are you gonna do?

74
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,920
It's the best thing we've ever had, etc.

75
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,640
I think that sort of misses the point.

76
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:04,680
Even if you think capitalism is sort of the end goal of progress in, you know, human society,

77
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,720
it's still a flawed system, and it still needs critiquing.

78
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,760
I think you should welcome the critique, because it helps it get better.

79
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,720
Even within capitalism, it's good to criticize capitalism.

80
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,000
Now, one of the reasons I think it's important to criticize capitalism

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,040
is it's taken the old sort of power dynamic that's been there throughout human history,

82
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,960
which is just, you know, the rich ruling over the poor, the powerful ruling over the less powerful,

83
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,360
and it's, uh, made it global.

84
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,680
So now you can live in the West in relative luxury,

85
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:47,400
and some poor bastard in China has to live basically as a slave to produce the goods that you consume.

86
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,760
And it's made it very difficult to fight against.

87
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,960
It's easy if you're just, you know, you're all the villagers in a town ruled over by a king.

88
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,440
You can see the oppression, it's right there in front of you,

89
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,080
but capitalism sort of globalized the oppression and spread it out so distantly,

90
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
that it's difficult to really organize against.

91
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,960
This is why I think if we are ever to move past capitalism,

92
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,760
it would have to be sort of a simultaneous global movement.

93
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,040
And that's why social justice is so important to me,

94
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,240
because it sort of erases barriers between people using empathy.

95
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,080
If you can get, you know, native-born people to sympathize with immigrants

96
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,800
who are really in the same economic boat that they are,

97
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,280
you know, if you can get men to empathize with women,

98
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,880
you know, people of all races to empathize with each other, etc.,

99
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,520
then you can get them all on the same economic team as well.

100
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,680
Well, I want to make clear here, I don't fi- I'm not just using it as a means to an end.

101
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,240
I'm not like, yeah, I'll support gay marriage because I want that fight to be over

102
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,080
so we can have the real, you know, economic fight.

103
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,280
I'm not saying that.

104
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,160
I think, you know, even within capitalism, ignoring the economic aspects of it,

105
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,120
it'd still be good to fight for all these social justice causes,

106
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,080
because they're worthwhile in and of themselves.

107
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,040
You know, there's sometimes a little bit of dissension among leftists over whether or not,

108
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,240
you know, social justice is, quote, worth it.

109
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,000
Like, you know, should we spend our time, you know, talking about this,

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,600
because, of course, that problem will go away if we just get rid of capitalism.

111
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,280
I think that's the wrong way to look at it.

112
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,640
I think it's- they're all really just reflections of the same problem,

113
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:40,120
which is just a lack of empathy causing people to want to rule over other people.

114
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,600
This is why I usually script videos, by the way,

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,080
because I go off the rails and end up trying to talk about everything at once.

116
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,040
Right, more questions.

117
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,160
That's from Mikey there.

118
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,400
Jen did a thumbnail for the last video,

119
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,640
which now hopefully that's her job and she does the rest of the thumbnails, but we'll see.

120
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,440
But no, Jen is a lot more involved in our Friday Twitch stream.

121
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,360
The reason that the YouTube channel's called Sean and Jen is because

122
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,720
she used to be involved in the YouTube content,

123
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,720
but then she got kind of busy for a while last year and then couldn't carry on with that,

124
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,560
so I just sort of took it over by myself.

125
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,600
And then completely unrelated to that, that's where we really took off, you know.

126
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,280
Um, so we were both in the videos and we got about 10 or 20 views on average,

127
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,680
and then Jen went and then we started getting thousands of views on average.

128
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,960
Um, now, is that related?

129
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,460
I don't know.

130
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,880
Who's to say?

131
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,800
What are a few of your all-time favorite books

132
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,400
or books that have had the most influence on your worldview?

133
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,720
To make it fun, at least one fiction and one non-fiction, please.

134
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,080
From Alvy.

135
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,760
I always get made fun of when I say my favorite book, which is Ulysses by James Joyce,

136
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,440
because people think I'm just trying to be clever

137
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,680
by saying my favorite book is what's considered one of the greatest novels of all time.

138
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
But it's... it's not.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,520
It's... I like it.

140
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,920
It's my favorite book, and everyone... everyone can leave me alone, frankly.

141
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,280
Now, my favorite non-fiction book that I own,

142
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,640
and one of my favorite books of all time is a photo book called City of Darkness,

143
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,120
which details life inside Kowloon Walled City.

144
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,400
And if you don't know what that is,

145
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,000
you should go and read the Wikipedia page on it because it's absolutely fascinating.

146
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,600
Why is it that the people you respond to in your videos

147
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,880
often seem so much more interested in winning than learning or growing?

148
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,800
Well, basically, it's not in their financial interests to learn or grow.

149
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,840
If you look at someone like Behring, say, you know,

150
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,440
he's got a lot more subscribers than he gets video views.

151
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,120
It's because not all of his subs watch his videos, obviously, because they grew up.

152
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,520
Like, his target audience is sort of a revolving door

153
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,320
of people who are at a certain mentality, shall we say.

154
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,160
And he has to keep pandering to that,

155
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,280
because it's very hard to take what Behring does and, you know, grow it, make it more mature.

156
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:38,360
So he just has to keep targeting the exact same sort of middle-teenage,

157
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,280
I'm-very-clever-and-everyone-else-is-dumb sort of mentality.

158
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,360
And it's in his financial interest to do that.

159
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Like, he can't stop, or he'll not be able to pay his rent,

160
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,560
which is another problem with capitalism, ultimately.

161
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,060
Yeah.

162
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,320
C.P. Fazor says,

163
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,920
Yeah, I could do that.

164
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,880
I haven't actually looked into anyone else other than Leafy,

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,320
but I've had quite a few names suggested to me,

166
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,160
so that could certainly be an upcoming video or series of videos.

167
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,680
I need to look into them.

168
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,280
Someone, actually, who hears this, just send me, like, a list of them.

169
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,920
Send, like, you know, five, the five biggest ones.

170
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,360
This is how I'm actually chilling for help in my own Q&A video, right.

171
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,880
Milk says,

172
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,040
Um, possibly twice.

173
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,120
Never intentionally, actually,

174
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,440
but there've been a couple of times where weed's been in the room

175
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,320
and I've gotten so drunk that I can't remember what I did,

176
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,440
so... maybe I have, I can't remember.

177
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,040
Um, is it okay for non-Liverpool natives to use the term Scouser?

178
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,080
Uh, yeah, I don't see why not.

179
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,600
I've never had any issue with it.

180
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,320
I mean, Scouse isn't even from Liverpool, really,

181
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,840
so we kinda nicked that from somewhere else to begin with, um, as we do.

182
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,760
So, yeah. Go nuts.

183
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:22,920
Um, partially, although, aren't we all.

184
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,080
Someone else who's anonymous asks,

185
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,400
Uh, well, I think they almost get a lot of things.

186
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,520
They just, they identify real problems, but then come to the wrong conclusions.

187
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,520
For instance, they look at, say, the migrant crisis

188
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,560
and see all these problems associated with it,

189
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,880
um, and then their conclusion is to, you know, put up walls,

190
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,640
deport people,

191
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,320
things which I think will make it worse than it is now, you know.

192
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,160
And if you try and critique that and say,

193
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,000
well, no, actually, that will make it worse,

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,160
they say you're ignoring the problem,

195
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,280
um, because, of course, they have to have a monopoly

196
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,600
on being the only ones who can see the problem.

197
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,680
It's as if they think just by identifying that something is wrong,

198
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,880
then they automatically know what to do to fix it.

199
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,560
I love Columbo.

200
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,280
I think it's a great twist on the classic murder mystery format.

201
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,120
I really like the character.

202
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,960
I like that he's, like, some working class.

203
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,560
And all of his cases involve murderers who are much better off than him

204
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,080
and think they're a lot smarter than him.

205
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,040
And it's very formulaic, of course,

206
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,040
and it's occasionally a little bit contrived in its logic,

207
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,000
but it's typically really satisfying to watch.

208
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,480
I don't know if I could do a video on it

209
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,400
because I've basically just said all of my opinions about it right there.

210
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,280
So there you go.

211
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,120
That was my Columbo video.

212
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,880
Another anonymous person says,

213
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,400
how do you respond to people who come from the videos of your detractors

214
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,440
who harass you and not actually watch your videos?

215
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,560
Oh, by not caring about it, to be honest.

216
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,880
Um, that's obvious.

217
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,120
You know, someone makes a video about me,

218
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,560
then I, you know, my average watch time and like bar

219
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,800
are gonna be shot to shit for a couple of weeks.

220
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,000
But it's no issue, is it?

221
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,880
Someone told me that YouTube waits all of this stuff just by interaction,

222
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,240
so even dislikes aren't really a problem.

223
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,840
It's not like they drop you out of the suggested videos or anything,

224
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,480
so I'm not too bothered, to be honest.

225
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,560
What's your approach to dealing with negative response videos?

226
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,280
Do you just move on and ignore them or something else?

227
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,240
Well, I watched them just to make sure I didn't get caught out

228
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,960
on something that was, you know, obviously wrong.

229
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,880
And then after that, I just ignored them.

230
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,400
I'm not interested in getting into some video back and forth

231
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,080
with, say, Sargon made one about my last video about him

232
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,960
where he sort of did little riff tracks on my video

233
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,680
and just watched it through, shouting that I'm stupid and so on.

234
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,640
And there's nothing I can say back to that, you know.

235
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,200
I couldn't watch his video through and pause every time he said I'm an idiot

236
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,760
and go, actually, it is you who's the idiot.

237
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,640
You know, it's maybe on Twitter every now and then.

238
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,520
I'll have a bit of a sassy day, but not in videos.

239
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Did you go to university?

240
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
If so, what did you major in?

241
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,320
We've got an American writing in, ladies and gentlemen.

242
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,880
Thoughts on your college experience?

243
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
I did go to university.

244
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,600
I studied creative writing, although study is a bit of a stretch.

245
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,880
I mainly was at university in name only.

246
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,560
I didn't really attend all that much.

247
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,600
I mainly just used the time to get really drunk for a couple of years.

248
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,480
Um, so it was pretty fun.

249
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,520
All around, I'd highly recommend it.

250
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,560
Waymoo asks, one, where are my shoelaces?

251
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,160
Two, what happened to that response video you did to The Amazing Atheist?

252
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,440
I thought it was great and I miss it.

253
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,080
So your shoelaces are probably on your shoes.

254
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,320
You know, that's where I check first.

255
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,960
The Amazing Atheist video, it's annoying that,

256
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,280
because I caught him out on something really funny,

257
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,800
but I elsewhere speculated that he was crazy or in some way mentally ill,

258
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,800
which was wrong of me to do, I realize.

259
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,120
You know, regardless of how right or wrong I might be about that,

260
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,560
I approached it in a very indelicate manner that sort of directly connected

261
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:57,480
The Amazing Atheist's sort of horrible racist fuse to just any sort of mental illness.

262
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,440
And I didn't want to do that because, of course, there's a lot of people out there

263
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,560
who struggle with the mental health,

264
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,720
and that doesn't automatically mean they're horrible, you know, racist bastards.

265
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,760
So a couple of people wrote in saying they were uncomfortable with that,

266
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,400
and then after thinking about it, I realized I was as well.

267
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,040
So I just took the video down.

268
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,560
And I keep saying I'll re-edit it sometime, but meh.

269
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,720
I don't even want to look at it now, basically.

270
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,560
Do you think the skeptic community will begin to break ranks on the anti-SJW stuff

271
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
and start focusing on Republicans

272
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,920
simply because of how easy a target the Trump administration is?

273
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,120
I feel like someone looking for an easy target could do a weekly series

274
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,120
debunking Trump for the next four years and not ever run out of material.

275
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,840
Well, that's an interesting thing, isn't it?

276
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,200
I feel like, like with R. Tory politicians with Brexit,

277
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,320
a lot of them would have sort of preferred Hillary to win.

278
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,920
Because then they'd get an easy four more years

279
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,680
complaining about all the evil SJW leftists being in charge of society,

280
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,200
which they're still doing now, even though it doesn't really make any sense.

281
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,000
Like, Trump got into office and is in power now,

282
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,120
but they're still sitting around on YouTube complaining

283
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,200
that a feminist said something stupid.

284
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,680
And it's funny when you see one of them occasionally be like,

285
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,800
Wait until my subscribers get a load of me making fun of Trump.

286
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,280
Oh, they'll see I'm not just some right-winger.

287
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,080
I can- I can go after the conservatives as well.

288
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,240
Yeah, but do they?

289
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,320
Not really.

290
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,520
Do you think that the media calling white people racist

291
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,080
has led to a rise in white nationalism,

292
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,880
i.e. people are more willing to stand up for being white

293
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,560
and therefore be racist to other people in a shocking turn of events?

294
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,280
Um, no, actually.

295
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,640
I think the recent rise in white nationalism

296
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,240
and sort of more open racism

297
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,880
is more to do with the economic climate over the last decade.

298
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,960
Of course, you know, you get these periods occasionally under capitalism.

299
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,120
That's one of the other problems with capitalism.

300
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,440
There's boom and bust cycles, and that's normal.

301
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,880
That's not an aberration.

302
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,760
It's important to understand that in a capitalist system,

303
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,840
like, we have this happens.

304
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,080
It has to, you know.

305
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,760
And when that happens, people start looking for solutions

306
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,160
and they don't always correctly identify the problem

307
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,840
and they come to the wrong conclusions.

308
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,120
Like, it's easy to say,

309
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,160
Well, people are struggling to find work

310
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,200
and all these immigrants are coming over here taking all of our jobs.

311
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,120
Um, but that's not the problem, really.

312
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,240
The problem is that you live in a system in which there is a scarcity of jobs.

313
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,840
You know, I was actually in a truck 10 years ago with my dad,

314
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,040
who's a truck driver,

315
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,120
and we were listening to a news story about the then very recent economic crash

316
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,840
and there was a lot of, quote, experts,

317
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,960
like, ruminating over the extent of how bad this was.

318
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,520
Is this a sort of economy-ending crash

319
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,000
or is it one that we'll recover from fairly quickly?

320
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,000
And while they were talking about it, my dad said to me,

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,960
You watch now.

322
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,800
Over the next few years, everyone's going to become a lot more racist.

323
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,920
And I said, Why?

324
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,080
And he said, Well, when this happens, people start looking for someone to blame.

325
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,120
And it's the most prescient thing he's ever said to me

326
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,560
and it's been completely borne out in reality.

327
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,680
Killer Rubarb, I think that's how you say that, says,

328
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,120
Why are anti-feminists so quick to dismiss the wage gap

329
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,320
as just an average that doesn't take things into account?

330
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,680
Of course it's an average,

331
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,040
but those things it doesn't take into account could be inherently sexist.

332
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,760
Like, why do women choose to take lower-paying jobs?

333
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,040
Is it because they want them

334
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,080
or because it's harder to get into STEM fields and programming?

335
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,760
Yeah, of course.

336
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,840
Well, anti-fems typically just look at everything legally.

337
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,560
They say, Well, you know, we freed the slaves

338
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,640
and we gave black people the vote, so now racism is pretty much over.

339
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,920
Women have legal equality with men now,

340
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,640
so of course there's no more issue, is there?

341
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,000
They sort of willfully can't see the systemic aspects of it, you know?

342
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,840
Like, you can remove the legal barriers for women getting into these professions,

343
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,800
but that doesn't mean you remove the social barriers

344
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,880
for women getting into those professions.

345
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,320
You know, if those professions are more likely to hire men than women,

346
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,040
just based upon the fact that they're men,

347
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,080
you know, that's an issue,

348
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,720
and it's not one that can be very easily solved legally, you know,

349
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,960
except for imposing quotas and the like,

350
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,760
which I don't think the anti-fems are much of a fan of, really.

351
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Do you think people should be held accountable

352
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,600
for deciding not to get involved when someone they are associated with

353
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,800
starts parroting white nationalist talking points,

354
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,000
e.g. all the YouTubers who have collaborated with JonTron?

355
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,920
That's from Cheeky there.

356
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,480
I'm more concerned with holding accountable people

357
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,160
who didn't just not get involved but came out in support of them.

358
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,600
I mean, they're the real...

359
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,360
They're rarely who are at fault here.

360
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,400
As for not getting involved,

361
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,880
I think I certainly wouldn't blame someone

362
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,000
for having a problem with someone avoiding that issue.

363
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,120
I mean, you know,

364
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,080
white nationalism isn't something you really want to beat around the bush on,

365
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,720
is it?

366
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,840
It shouldn't be difficult to come out and say,

367
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,560
I don't agree with white nationalism or racism.

368
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,240
But apparently, you know, that's where we are in 2017,

369
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,240
in the current year.

370
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,120
Who is your favorite Roman emperor and why is it Caligula?

371
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,480
Signed, Caligula.

372
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,040
Well, it's not Caligula, because he was an insane murderer.

373
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,960
My favorite Roman emperor is Claudius,

374
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,200
who is very interesting and everyone should go read about on Wikipedia.

375
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,280
I won't talk about Claudius for too long,

376
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,040
and I could, because he's very interesting.

377
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,440
But basically, he was part of Augustus,

378
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,360
that's the first emperor of Rome's royal family,

379
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,200
and he had some sort of medical issue,

380
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,360
which modern historians think is cerebral palsy or Tourette's or something like that.

381
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,920
He struggled to speak and he walked with a limp

382
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,880
and his family sort of kept him out of the limelight

383
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,680
and didn't really let the public see him.

384
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,560
So he just became a scholar and he read a lot.

385
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,920
And then after Caligula really went off the deep end

386
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,440
and declared himself a god,

387
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,640
and everyone just figured it would be better to kill him,

388
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,000
there was a coup and they killed Caligula and his whole family.

389
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,240
And the only one that they left alive was Claudius,

390
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,400
who they declared the emperor,

391
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,760
because of course the troops still needed an emperor to be on the throne

392
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,200
so that they could get paid.

393
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,960
They didn't want to put the Senate back in charge

394
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,840
and then they, you know, dissolve all of the troops' power.

395
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,560
So Claudius just sort of randomly ended up as the emperor

396
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,680
and everyone thought,

397
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,800
oh god, we've got a mad fool as an emperor.

398
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,000
But he actually turned out to be a really capable administrator.

399
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,920
It was like a big surprise twist.

400
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,600
If anyone's ever watched Game of Thrones,

401
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,160
I don't know if you've ever heard of that show Game of Thrones,

402
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:47,640
the character of Tyrion Lannister is based rather heavily on Claudius,

403
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,160
as Joffrey is on Caligula, I believe.

404
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,040
What are some of your interests outside of making video?

405
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,760
I believe you mentioned playing Warcraft and liking action movies.

406
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,360
That's from ShadowTheLincolnParkHog666.

407
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Now I've paired this one with another question to come at the end of the video.

408
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,960
Hi Sean, I wanted to know your thoughts on the current World of Warcraft expansion.

409
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,880
Are you a fan of the Demon Hunter class?

410
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,280
Thoughts on Illidan, characters being killed off,

411
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,360
Gul'dan ETC from Gavi.

412
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,000
Now I'll put this one at the end because if I did this one first,

413
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,320
then, you know, everyone would click the video off.

414
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,760
I do play Warcraft on and off.

415
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,000
I can't consistently play it.

416
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,920
It can't hold me for that long.

417
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,040
I play for a couple of weeks every few months, pretty much,

418
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,960
just to see all the new stuff that's in the game.

419
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
I'm not like a progression raider or something.

420
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,280
The current expansion made a lot of improvements over the last expansion.

421
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,920
The last one, Draenor, is the worst the game's ever been by a long shot.

422
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,320
This one fixed a lot of those problems, but carried on a lot of those problems.

423
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,720
The class halls are a major improvement over the Garrison of the Last expansion,

424
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,560
which was, like, the main reason it was rubbish.

425
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,800
Demon Hunters, I haven't- I've only played through the start area.

426
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,000
They seem fine.

427
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,320
I don't know, I don't have much to say about this.

428
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,520
Illidan, well, of course, that's where they've really went wrong story-wise.

429
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,760
They got rid of Froll, who was, for the uninitiated,

430
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,520
Froll was like the Mary Sue of Chris Metzen within the World of Warcraft.

431
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,960
He was orc Jesus, he typically gets referred to as,

432
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:32,600
and was responsible or involved with every single major plot element in the entire game

433
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,840
and would turn up when your raid group had just finished fighting a boss

434
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,480
and he'd get the last kill in, or you'd be fighting another major lore character

435
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,960
and then the game would just make you lose so that Froll could come and save you.

436
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,800
And everyone hated Froll, so they just sort of benched him.

437
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,080
But now they've replaced him with Illidan, who was always an interesting character

438
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:02,280
in that he was pretty much just some average elf who was really incredibly driven

439
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:09,000
and now they've made him elf Jesus, who was predestined to blah blah blah blah blah.

440
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,040
And it's all incredibly boring and contrived.

441
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,400
Like, for what a mess Warcraft's story is, there are occasionally good elements to it

442
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,080
and Illidan's story was one of those and now they've ruined it.

443
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,040
As for the characters who have been killed off, I think that was good.

444
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:30,760
It gave a sense of actual, like, threat to the antagonists of this expansion.

445
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,400
I mean, the orcs in the last expansion, they didn't kill anyone, I don't think,

446
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,120
apart from characters who had just been introduced.

447
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,960
They were, like, immediately beaten.

448
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,680
But in this one, the Legion turn up and kill off a whole bunch of named lore characters.

449
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,320
It's like, oh, actually, this is a threat this time.

450
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,440
Um, so that was, uh, no one's still here, are they?

451
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,360
Uh, so, okay, Gabi, since you're the only person who's still listening at this point.

452
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,520
Heh heh heh heh.

453
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,800
Thanks a lot for that question.

454
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,800
Um, thanks a lot to everyone else who asked questions.

455
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,720
Um, I couldn't put them all in, but any that I didn't answer here,

456
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I'll have a go at answering on Curious Cats.

457
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,480
So, thanks a lot, everyone, and I'll see you next time.
