00:00.000 --> 00:07.160
Hello everyone. Um, so I hit 10,000 subscribers on YouTube yesterday, which, um,

00:07.160 --> 00:12.420
it's just another number really, isn't it? But, uh, whatever, it's a nice round milestone.

00:12.420 --> 00:16.380
So I've decided to do a little question and answer video just as a little extra

00:16.380 --> 00:20.080
before I get back to, uh, whatever else it is I do.

00:20.080 --> 00:24.140
Um, an anonymous user asks,

00:24.140 --> 00:30.280
Do you think with the growing popularity of yourself, Hbomber, Contra, and Tomavella, and others,

00:30.280 --> 00:34.840
you might be able to rival the skeptic community in popularity?

00:34.840 --> 00:41.540
Uh, well, yes. Yeah. In a lot of cases, we already do.

00:41.540 --> 00:46.880
I mean, there are bigger channels than any of those names there that put out similar content to us,

00:46.880 --> 00:50.680
and there are a lot of skeptic channels that aren't doing so well recently.

00:50.840 --> 00:58.440
Um, but even the biggest skeptic channels, remember, their sub-numbers are a bit of a- a bit of a con.

00:58.440 --> 01:03.040
Like, if you look at, um, the AmazenAtheist, say, he's got a million subscribers,

01:03.040 --> 01:06.360
but he doesn't get a million views on his videos, does he? It's just,

01:06.360 --> 01:10.760
their channels have been around for a lot longer than us, so they- they've accrued a lot of, uh,

01:10.760 --> 01:17.000
a lot of dead subscribers. Not literally dead. Although I guess a few of them are probably dead.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.480
One of- at least one of my subscribers has probably died.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.040
Bit morbid.

01:22.040 --> 01:28.200
Um, but yeah, if you just- if you look on view counts, like, we're gettin' there.

01:28.200 --> 01:32.800
Uh, plus we're gonna benefit from the political swing over the course of, uh,

01:32.800 --> 01:38.600
Trump's, uh, term in office. Or terms in office, if we live in the dark timeline.

01:38.600 --> 01:46.600
You know, broadly, there's always a- a swing of the moderates away from whatever the politics of the American president are over the course of his term.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.640
Uh, so, in short, yes.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.640
Bandit asks,

01:51.640 --> 01:55.160
What do you think led to a rise in subs so fast?

01:55.160 --> 02:01.160
I remember finding you completely by fluke after the Leafy video, and seeing this change is bizarre.

02:01.160 --> 02:06.360
Uh, well, thank you, Bandit, for the, uh, possibly insulting question there.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.360
Um, I don't really know either.

02:08.360 --> 02:14.120
Uh, my channel's been growing a lot faster than some other channels that are similar to mine, but better.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.560
Uh, so I don't really know what's going on, to be perfectly honest.

02:17.560 --> 02:23.400
I've got a lot of very helpful, uh, shout-outs by said people who are better than me.

02:23.400 --> 02:29.240
Uh, so, thanks a lot for those. It's probably just all of those, and not anything that I've actually done.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.480
An anonymous user asks,

02:31.480 --> 02:35.160
What steps do you do to ensure your videos are quality?

02:35.160 --> 02:37.800
Well, I would never call my videos quality.

02:37.800 --> 02:43.400
Uh, but I put this question in here, uh, because I wanna mention something about my last video I put out.

02:43.400 --> 02:52.600
So, uh, that video about, uh, Sargon's This Week in Stupid series, um, in the writing process of that one,

02:52.600 --> 02:54.600
I made a really big error.

02:54.600 --> 03:02.200
Uh, I, uh, misheard something that Sargon said, and then accused him of something that wasn't true, and didn't notice.

03:02.200 --> 03:09.080
And I listened to the audio through, didn't notice it, and it was at the end of the editing process that I actually noticed,

03:09.080 --> 03:11.240
Oh, wait, hang on, I've made a mistake there.

03:11.240 --> 03:17.800
But it's only because I did so many checks, four mistakes like that, that I caught it and could cut it out.

03:17.800 --> 03:22.680
You can't do that if you're just pumping out one of those videos every day.

03:22.680 --> 03:28.280
Because, of course, Sargon can make four of those videos in the time it takes me to fact-check one of them,

03:28.280 --> 03:32.440
and, of course, we all make mistakes, so that's how mistakes get through.

03:32.440 --> 03:38.040
If you just get content out as quickly as possible, then you are gonna make mistakes.

03:38.040 --> 03:44.840
Uh, so, I guess I'd say, even though I don't think my videos are very good anyway, uh, taking my time with them.

03:44.840 --> 03:50.120
How do you define your political views? asks someone else who's anonymous.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.120
No one's sent in names with these.

03:52.120 --> 03:58.200
Um, I don't want you to label yourself as anything, I just want to understand your ideology.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.200
Sorry if this is a bad, boring question.

04:00.200 --> 04:05.080
It's not a bad or boring question. In fact, I got this question more than anything else.

04:05.160 --> 04:05.960
So, I should-

04:05.960 --> 04:10.040
Heh, heh, heh. I got, like, ten people asking me this.

04:10.040 --> 04:15.880
Um, so, broadly, I don't use, uh, political labels for things.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.000
Uh, just because I personally find them a bit unhelpful.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.120
Uh, when pushed, I'll call myself, uh, an anti-capitalist.

04:24.120 --> 04:30.520
Uh, but even that's a bit of a dodge, really, and then if you push me even further than that, I'll probably say I'm a socialist.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.800
But I should explain.

04:31.880 --> 04:43.000
When you say socialist to two different people, one of them will think of a, you know, wonderful egalitarian Star Trek utopia.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.080
And the other one will think of Stalin putting them in a gulag.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.880
So, this is why I sort of find these- these labels sort of unhelpful.

04:51.880 --> 04:57.000
The reason I go to anti-capitalist first is because I think there's a lot of problems with capitalism,

04:57.000 --> 05:01.960
and I think it's not getting a proper critique.

05:01.960 --> 05:05.080
Or it's never questioned by anyone who's in power in the West.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.400
Um, and it needs to be.

05:07.400 --> 05:12.040
You know, if you have only two political parties in the country that can ever get into power,

05:12.040 --> 05:18.040
and the only way they can get into power is by never ever saying anything questioning of capitalism,

05:18.040 --> 05:20.920
then that leads to a lot of problems.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.240
Especially considering there are sort of systemic, inherent problems with capitalism.

05:27.800 --> 05:35.240
And they never get dealt with just because there's nobody on the political stage who's, you know, allowed to deal with them.

05:35.880 --> 05:42.920
And to people who automatically, uh, jump to the defense of capitalism, which I understand, you know,

05:42.920 --> 05:47.880
somebody says capitalism's bad, they say, well, what would you replace it with?

05:47.880 --> 05:51.800
What's better? You know, this has never worked out, that's never worked out, what are you gonna do?

05:52.360 --> 05:54.920
It's the best thing we've ever had, etc.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.640
I think that sort of misses the point.

05:57.640 --> 06:04.680
Even if you think capitalism is sort of the end goal of progress in, you know, human society,

06:05.240 --> 06:09.720
it's still a flawed system, and it still needs critiquing.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.760
I think you should welcome the critique, because it helps it get better.

06:13.400 --> 06:17.720
Even within capitalism, it's good to criticize capitalism.

06:17.720 --> 06:21.000
Now, one of the reasons I think it's important to criticize capitalism

06:21.000 --> 06:26.040
is it's taken the old sort of power dynamic that's been there throughout human history,

06:26.040 --> 06:31.960
which is just, you know, the rich ruling over the poor, the powerful ruling over the less powerful,

06:31.960 --> 06:34.360
and it's, uh, made it global.

06:34.360 --> 06:38.680
So now you can live in the West in relative luxury,

06:38.680 --> 06:47.400
and some poor bastard in China has to live basically as a slave to produce the goods that you consume.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.760
And it's made it very difficult to fight against.

06:50.760 --> 06:55.960
It's easy if you're just, you know, you're all the villagers in a town ruled over by a king.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.440
You can see the oppression, it's right there in front of you,

06:59.080 --> 07:05.080
but capitalism sort of globalized the oppression and spread it out so distantly,

07:05.800 --> 07:07.800
that it's difficult to really organize against.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.960
This is why I think if we are ever to move past capitalism,

07:11.960 --> 07:16.760
it would have to be sort of a simultaneous global movement.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.040
And that's why social justice is so important to me,

07:20.040 --> 07:25.240
because it sort of erases barriers between people using empathy.

07:26.440 --> 07:31.080
If you can get, you know, native-born people to sympathize with immigrants

07:31.080 --> 07:33.800
who are really in the same economic boat that they are,

07:33.800 --> 07:36.280
you know, if you can get men to empathize with women,

07:37.400 --> 07:41.880
you know, people of all races to empathize with each other, etc.,

07:41.880 --> 07:46.520
then you can get them all on the same economic team as well.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.680
Well, I want to make clear here, I don't fi- I'm not just using it as a means to an end.

07:50.680 --> 07:55.240
I'm not like, yeah, I'll support gay marriage because I want that fight to be over

07:55.240 --> 07:59.080
so we can have the real, you know, economic fight.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.280
I'm not saying that.

08:00.280 --> 08:05.160
I think, you know, even within capitalism, ignoring the economic aspects of it,

08:05.160 --> 08:08.120
it'd still be good to fight for all these social justice causes,

08:08.120 --> 08:11.080
because they're worthwhile in and of themselves.

08:11.080 --> 08:16.040
You know, there's sometimes a little bit of dissension among leftists over whether or not,

08:16.040 --> 08:19.240
you know, social justice is, quote, worth it.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.000
Like, you know, should we spend our time, you know, talking about this,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.600
because, of course, that problem will go away if we just get rid of capitalism.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.280
I think that's the wrong way to look at it.

08:28.280 --> 08:33.640
I think it's- they're all really just reflections of the same problem,

08:33.640 --> 08:40.120
which is just a lack of empathy causing people to want to rule over other people.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.600
This is why I usually script videos, by the way,

08:42.600 --> 08:47.080
because I go off the rails and end up trying to talk about everything at once.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.040
Right, more questions.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.160
That's from Mikey there.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.400
Jen did a thumbnail for the last video,

09:03.400 --> 09:07.640
which now hopefully that's her job and she does the rest of the thumbnails, but we'll see.

09:08.200 --> 09:12.440
But no, Jen is a lot more involved in our Friday Twitch stream.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.360
The reason that the YouTube channel's called Sean and Jen is because

09:16.360 --> 09:19.720
she used to be involved in the YouTube content,

09:19.720 --> 09:25.720
but then she got kind of busy for a while last year and then couldn't carry on with that,

09:25.720 --> 09:27.560
so I just sort of took it over by myself.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.600
And then completely unrelated to that, that's where we really took off, you know.

09:33.160 --> 09:38.280
Um, so we were both in the videos and we got about 10 or 20 views on average,

09:38.840 --> 09:42.680
and then Jen went and then we started getting thousands of views on average.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.960
Um, now, is that related?

09:45.960 --> 09:46.460
I don't know.

09:47.080 --> 09:47.880
Who's to say?

09:49.240 --> 09:51.800
What are a few of your all-time favorite books

09:52.440 --> 09:55.400
or books that have had the most influence on your worldview?

09:55.400 --> 09:59.720
To make it fun, at least one fiction and one non-fiction, please.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.080
From Alvy.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.760
I always get made fun of when I say my favorite book, which is Ulysses by James Joyce,

10:06.760 --> 10:10.440
because people think I'm just trying to be clever

10:10.440 --> 10:16.680
by saying my favorite book is what's considered one of the greatest novels of all time.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.000
But it's... it's not.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.520
It's... I like it.

10:20.520 --> 10:24.920
It's my favorite book, and everyone... everyone can leave me alone, frankly.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.280
Now, my favorite non-fiction book that I own,

10:28.280 --> 10:33.640
and one of my favorite books of all time is a photo book called City of Darkness,

10:34.520 --> 10:40.120
which details life inside Kowloon Walled City.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.400
And if you don't know what that is,

10:42.040 --> 10:47.000
you should go and read the Wikipedia page on it because it's absolutely fascinating.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.600
Why is it that the people you respond to in your videos

10:50.600 --> 10:55.880
often seem so much more interested in winning than learning or growing?

10:55.880 --> 11:01.800
Well, basically, it's not in their financial interests to learn or grow.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.840
If you look at someone like Behring, say, you know,

11:04.840 --> 11:08.440
he's got a lot more subscribers than he gets video views.

11:08.440 --> 11:14.120
It's because not all of his subs watch his videos, obviously, because they grew up.

11:14.120 --> 11:18.520
Like, his target audience is sort of a revolving door

11:18.520 --> 11:23.320
of people who are at a certain mentality, shall we say.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.160
And he has to keep pandering to that,

11:26.360 --> 11:32.280
because it's very hard to take what Behring does and, you know, grow it, make it more mature.

11:32.280 --> 11:38.360
So he just has to keep targeting the exact same sort of middle-teenage,

11:38.360 --> 11:42.280
I'm-very-clever-and-everyone-else-is-dumb sort of mentality.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.360
And it's in his financial interest to do that.

11:44.360 --> 11:50.360
Like, he can't stop, or he'll not be able to pay his rent,

11:50.360 --> 11:53.560
which is another problem with capitalism, ultimately.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.060
Yeah.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.320
C.P. Fazor says,

12:09.880 --> 12:10.920
Yeah, I could do that.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.880
I haven't actually looked into anyone else other than Leafy,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.320
but I've had quite a few names suggested to me,

12:17.320 --> 12:23.160
so that could certainly be an upcoming video or series of videos.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.680
I need to look into them.

12:24.680 --> 12:28.280
Someone, actually, who hears this, just send me, like, a list of them.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.920
Send, like, you know, five, the five biggest ones.

12:31.800 --> 12:38.360
This is how I'm actually chilling for help in my own Q&A video, right.

12:39.000 --> 12:39.880
Milk says,

12:41.480 --> 12:44.040
Um, possibly twice.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.120
Never intentionally, actually,

12:46.120 --> 12:48.440
but there've been a couple of times where weed's been in the room

12:48.440 --> 12:51.320
and I've gotten so drunk that I can't remember what I did,

12:51.320 --> 12:54.440
so... maybe I have, I can't remember.

12:54.440 --> 13:00.040
Um, is it okay for non-Liverpool natives to use the term Scouser?

13:00.600 --> 13:03.080
Uh, yeah, I don't see why not.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.600
I've never had any issue with it.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.320
I mean, Scouse isn't even from Liverpool, really,

13:07.320 --> 13:12.840
so we kinda nicked that from somewhere else to begin with, um, as we do.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.760
So, yeah. Go nuts.

13:14.840 --> 13:22.920
Um, partially, although, aren't we all.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.080
Someone else who's anonymous asks,

13:31.560 --> 13:35.400
Uh, well, I think they almost get a lot of things.

13:35.400 --> 13:40.520
They just, they identify real problems, but then come to the wrong conclusions.

13:40.600 --> 13:44.520
For instance, they look at, say, the migrant crisis

13:44.520 --> 13:47.560
and see all these problems associated with it,

13:47.560 --> 13:51.880
um, and then their conclusion is to, you know, put up walls,

13:52.840 --> 13:53.640
deport people,

13:54.520 --> 13:59.320
things which I think will make it worse than it is now, you know.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.160
And if you try and critique that and say,

14:01.160 --> 14:03.000
well, no, actually, that will make it worse,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.160
they say you're ignoring the problem,

14:05.160 --> 14:08.280
um, because, of course, they have to have a monopoly

14:08.360 --> 14:10.600
on being the only ones who can see the problem.

14:11.480 --> 14:14.680
It's as if they think just by identifying that something is wrong,

14:14.680 --> 14:17.880
then they automatically know what to do to fix it.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.560
I love Columbo.

14:27.560 --> 14:32.280
I think it's a great twist on the classic murder mystery format.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.120
I really like the character.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.960
I like that he's, like, some working class.

14:38.440 --> 14:45.560
And all of his cases involve murderers who are much better off than him

14:45.560 --> 14:47.080
and think they're a lot smarter than him.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.040
And it's very formulaic, of course,

14:50.760 --> 14:54.040
and it's occasionally a little bit contrived in its logic,

14:54.040 --> 14:57.000
but it's typically really satisfying to watch.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.480
I don't know if I could do a video on it

14:59.480 --> 15:03.400
because I've basically just said all of my opinions about it right there.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.280
So there you go.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.120
That was my Columbo video.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.880
Another anonymous person says,

15:07.880 --> 15:11.400
how do you respond to people who come from the videos of your detractors

15:11.400 --> 15:14.440
who harass you and not actually watch your videos?

15:14.440 --> 15:17.560
Oh, by not caring about it, to be honest.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.880
Um, that's obvious.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.120
You know, someone makes a video about me,

15:22.120 --> 15:25.560
then I, you know, my average watch time and like bar

15:25.560 --> 15:27.800
are gonna be shot to shit for a couple of weeks.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.000
But it's no issue, is it?

15:31.000 --> 15:35.880
Someone told me that YouTube waits all of this stuff just by interaction,

15:35.880 --> 15:39.240
so even dislikes aren't really a problem.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.840
It's not like they drop you out of the suggested videos or anything,

15:42.840 --> 15:45.480
so I'm not too bothered, to be honest.

15:45.480 --> 15:49.560
What's your approach to dealing with negative response videos?

15:49.560 --> 15:52.280
Do you just move on and ignore them or something else?

15:52.280 --> 15:55.240
Well, I watched them just to make sure I didn't get caught out

15:55.240 --> 15:57.960
on something that was, you know, obviously wrong.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.880
And then after that, I just ignored them.

15:59.880 --> 16:03.400
I'm not interested in getting into some video back and forth

16:03.400 --> 16:09.080
with, say, Sargon made one about my last video about him

16:09.080 --> 16:11.960
where he sort of did little riff tracks on my video

16:11.960 --> 16:14.680
and just watched it through, shouting that I'm stupid and so on.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.640
And there's nothing I can say back to that, you know.

16:17.640 --> 16:22.200
I couldn't watch his video through and pause every time he said I'm an idiot

16:22.200 --> 16:24.760
and go, actually, it is you who's the idiot.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.640
You know, it's maybe on Twitter every now and then.

16:27.640 --> 16:32.520
I'll have a bit of a sassy day, but not in videos.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.520
Did you go to university?

16:34.520 --> 16:36.520
If so, what did you major in?

16:36.520 --> 16:39.320
We've got an American writing in, ladies and gentlemen.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.880
Thoughts on your college experience?

16:41.880 --> 16:43.320
I did go to university.

16:43.320 --> 16:48.600
I studied creative writing, although study is a bit of a stretch.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.880
I mainly was at university in name only.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.560
I didn't really attend all that much.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.600
I mainly just used the time to get really drunk for a couple of years.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.480
Um, so it was pretty fun.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.520
All around, I'd highly recommend it.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.560
Waymoo asks, one, where are my shoelaces?

17:09.560 --> 17:13.160
Two, what happened to that response video you did to The Amazing Atheist?

17:13.160 --> 17:14.440
I thought it was great and I miss it.

17:15.320 --> 17:19.080
So your shoelaces are probably on your shoes.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.320
You know, that's where I check first.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.960
The Amazing Atheist video, it's annoying that,

17:25.960 --> 17:28.280
because I caught him out on something really funny,

17:28.280 --> 17:33.800
but I elsewhere speculated that he was crazy or in some way mentally ill,

17:35.080 --> 17:39.800
which was wrong of me to do, I realize.

17:39.800 --> 17:44.120
You know, regardless of how right or wrong I might be about that,

17:44.120 --> 17:49.560
I approached it in a very indelicate manner that sort of directly connected

17:49.560 --> 17:57.480
The Amazing Atheist's sort of horrible racist fuse to just any sort of mental illness.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.440
And I didn't want to do that because, of course, there's a lot of people out there

18:01.000 --> 18:03.560
who struggle with the mental health,

18:03.560 --> 18:07.720
and that doesn't automatically mean they're horrible, you know, racist bastards.

18:07.720 --> 18:12.760
So a couple of people wrote in saying they were uncomfortable with that,

18:12.760 --> 18:15.400
and then after thinking about it, I realized I was as well.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.040
So I just took the video down.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.560
And I keep saying I'll re-edit it sometime, but meh.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.720
I don't even want to look at it now, basically.

18:26.680 --> 18:31.560
Do you think the skeptic community will begin to break ranks on the anti-SJW stuff

18:31.560 --> 18:33.560
and start focusing on Republicans

18:33.560 --> 18:36.920
simply because of how easy a target the Trump administration is?

18:36.920 --> 18:40.120
I feel like someone looking for an easy target could do a weekly series

18:40.120 --> 18:44.120
debunking Trump for the next four years and not ever run out of material.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.840
Well, that's an interesting thing, isn't it?

18:46.840 --> 18:52.200
I feel like, like with R. Tory politicians with Brexit,

18:52.200 --> 18:55.320
a lot of them would have sort of preferred Hillary to win.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.920
Because then they'd get an easy four more years

18:59.480 --> 19:04.680
complaining about all the evil SJW leftists being in charge of society,

19:04.680 --> 19:08.200
which they're still doing now, even though it doesn't really make any sense.

19:08.760 --> 19:13.000
Like, Trump got into office and is in power now,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.120
but they're still sitting around on YouTube complaining

19:16.120 --> 19:18.200
that a feminist said something stupid.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.680
And it's funny when you see one of them occasionally be like,

19:21.240 --> 19:25.800
Wait until my subscribers get a load of me making fun of Trump.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.280
Oh, they'll see I'm not just some right-winger.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.080
I can- I can go after the conservatives as well.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.240
Yeah, but do they?

19:34.120 --> 19:35.320
Not really.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.520
Do you think that the media calling white people racist

19:38.520 --> 19:41.080
has led to a rise in white nationalism,

19:41.080 --> 19:43.880
i.e. people are more willing to stand up for being white

19:43.880 --> 19:47.560
and therefore be racist to other people in a shocking turn of events?

19:47.560 --> 19:50.280
Um, no, actually.

19:50.280 --> 19:55.640
I think the recent rise in white nationalism

19:55.640 --> 19:59.240
and sort of more open racism

19:59.240 --> 20:03.880
is more to do with the economic climate over the last decade.

20:03.880 --> 20:07.960
Of course, you know, you get these periods occasionally under capitalism.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.120
That's one of the other problems with capitalism.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.440
There's boom and bust cycles, and that's normal.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.880
That's not an aberration.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.760
It's important to understand that in a capitalist system,

20:18.760 --> 20:20.840
like, we have this happens.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.080
It has to, you know.

20:23.960 --> 20:28.760
And when that happens, people start looking for solutions

20:29.320 --> 20:33.160
and they don't always correctly identify the problem

20:33.160 --> 20:34.840
and they come to the wrong conclusions.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.120
Like, it's easy to say,

20:36.120 --> 20:39.160
Well, people are struggling to find work

20:39.160 --> 20:42.200
and all these immigrants are coming over here taking all of our jobs.

20:42.760 --> 20:46.120
Um, but that's not the problem, really.

20:46.120 --> 20:51.240
The problem is that you live in a system in which there is a scarcity of jobs.

20:51.240 --> 20:56.840
You know, I was actually in a truck 10 years ago with my dad,

20:56.840 --> 20:58.040
who's a truck driver,

20:58.040 --> 21:04.120
and we were listening to a news story about the then very recent economic crash

21:04.120 --> 21:06.840
and there was a lot of, quote, experts,

21:07.560 --> 21:11.960
like, ruminating over the extent of how bad this was.

21:12.280 --> 21:16.520
Is this a sort of economy-ending crash

21:16.520 --> 21:19.000
or is it one that we'll recover from fairly quickly?

21:19.960 --> 21:23.000
And while they were talking about it, my dad said to me,

21:23.000 --> 21:23.960
You watch now.

21:23.960 --> 21:27.800
Over the next few years, everyone's going to become a lot more racist.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.920
And I said, Why?

21:28.920 --> 21:33.080
And he said, Well, when this happens, people start looking for someone to blame.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.120
And it's the most prescient thing he's ever said to me

21:36.120 --> 21:39.560
and it's been completely borne out in reality.

21:39.560 --> 21:42.680
Killer Rubarb, I think that's how you say that, says,

21:42.680 --> 21:46.120
Why are anti-feminists so quick to dismiss the wage gap

21:46.120 --> 21:49.320
as just an average that doesn't take things into account?

21:49.320 --> 21:50.680
Of course it's an average,

21:50.680 --> 21:54.040
but those things it doesn't take into account could be inherently sexist.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.760
Like, why do women choose to take lower-paying jobs?

21:56.760 --> 21:58.040
Is it because they want them

21:58.040 --> 22:01.080
or because it's harder to get into STEM fields and programming?

22:02.040 --> 22:02.760
Yeah, of course.

22:02.760 --> 22:06.840
Well, anti-fems typically just look at everything legally.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.560
They say, Well, you know, we freed the slaves

22:09.560 --> 22:13.640
and we gave black people the vote, so now racism is pretty much over.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.920
Women have legal equality with men now,

22:16.920 --> 22:19.640
so of course there's no more issue, is there?

22:19.640 --> 22:25.000
They sort of willfully can't see the systemic aspects of it, you know?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.840
Like, you can remove the legal barriers for women getting into these professions,

22:28.840 --> 22:31.800
but that doesn't mean you remove the social barriers

22:31.800 --> 22:33.880
for women getting into those professions.

22:33.880 --> 22:37.320
You know, if those professions are more likely to hire men than women,

22:37.320 --> 22:40.040
just based upon the fact that they're men,

22:40.040 --> 22:41.080
you know, that's an issue,

22:41.080 --> 22:45.720
and it's not one that can be very easily solved legally, you know,

22:45.720 --> 22:47.960
except for imposing quotas and the like,

22:48.680 --> 22:52.760
which I don't think the anti-fems are much of a fan of, really.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.760
Do you think people should be held accountable

22:54.760 --> 22:58.600
for deciding not to get involved when someone they are associated with

22:58.600 --> 23:01.800
starts parroting white nationalist talking points,

23:01.800 --> 23:05.000
e.g. all the YouTubers who have collaborated with JonTron?

23:06.520 --> 23:08.920
That's from Cheeky there.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.480
I'm more concerned with holding accountable people

23:11.480 --> 23:15.160
who didn't just not get involved but came out in support of them.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.600
I mean, they're the real...

23:16.600 --> 23:18.360
They're rarely who are at fault here.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.400
As for not getting involved,

23:21.400 --> 23:23.880
I think I certainly wouldn't blame someone

23:23.880 --> 23:27.000
for having a problem with someone avoiding that issue.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.120
I mean, you know,

23:28.840 --> 23:33.080
white nationalism isn't something you really want to beat around the bush on,

23:33.080 --> 23:33.720
is it?

23:33.720 --> 23:36.840
It shouldn't be difficult to come out and say,

23:36.840 --> 23:41.560
I don't agree with white nationalism or racism.

23:41.560 --> 23:45.240
But apparently, you know, that's where we are in 2017,

23:46.200 --> 23:47.240
in the current year.

23:48.040 --> 23:52.120
Who is your favorite Roman emperor and why is it Caligula?

23:52.120 --> 23:53.480
Signed, Caligula.

23:53.480 --> 23:58.040
Well, it's not Caligula, because he was an insane murderer.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.960
My favorite Roman emperor is Claudius,

24:03.320 --> 24:08.200
who is very interesting and everyone should go read about on Wikipedia.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.280
I won't talk about Claudius for too long,

24:10.280 --> 24:14.040
and I could, because he's very interesting.

24:14.040 --> 24:18.440
But basically, he was part of Augustus,

24:18.440 --> 24:22.360
that's the first emperor of Rome's royal family,

24:22.360 --> 24:24.200
and he had some sort of medical issue,

24:24.200 --> 24:30.360
which modern historians think is cerebral palsy or Tourette's or something like that.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.920
He struggled to speak and he walked with a limp

24:34.920 --> 24:37.880
and his family sort of kept him out of the limelight

24:37.880 --> 24:40.680
and didn't really let the public see him.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.560
So he just became a scholar and he read a lot.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.920
And then after Caligula really went off the deep end

24:46.920 --> 24:48.440
and declared himself a god,

24:48.440 --> 24:51.640
and everyone just figured it would be better to kill him,

24:52.520 --> 24:57.000
there was a coup and they killed Caligula and his whole family.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.240
And the only one that they left alive was Claudius,

25:01.960 --> 25:03.400
who they declared the emperor,

25:03.400 --> 25:06.760
because of course the troops still needed an emperor to be on the throne

25:06.760 --> 25:08.200
so that they could get paid.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.960
They didn't want to put the Senate back in charge

25:09.960 --> 25:12.840
and then they, you know, dissolve all of the troops' power.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.560
So Claudius just sort of randomly ended up as the emperor

25:17.560 --> 25:18.680
and everyone thought,

25:18.680 --> 25:21.800
oh god, we've got a mad fool as an emperor.

25:21.880 --> 25:27.000
But he actually turned out to be a really capable administrator.

25:28.840 --> 25:32.920
It was like a big surprise twist.

25:32.920 --> 25:36.600
If anyone's ever watched Game of Thrones,

25:36.600 --> 25:39.160
I don't know if you've ever heard of that show Game of Thrones,

25:40.920 --> 25:47.640
the character of Tyrion Lannister is based rather heavily on Claudius,

25:47.640 --> 25:51.160
as Joffrey is on Caligula, I believe.

25:51.240 --> 25:54.040
What are some of your interests outside of making video?

25:54.040 --> 25:56.760
I believe you mentioned playing Warcraft and liking action movies.

25:56.760 --> 26:00.360
That's from ShadowTheLincolnParkHog666.

26:01.240 --> 26:05.240
Now I've paired this one with another question to come at the end of the video.

26:05.240 --> 26:09.960
Hi Sean, I wanted to know your thoughts on the current World of Warcraft expansion.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.880
Are you a fan of the Demon Hunter class?

26:11.880 --> 26:14.280
Thoughts on Illidan, characters being killed off,

26:14.280 --> 26:16.360
Gul'dan ETC from Gavi.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.000
Now I'll put this one at the end because if I did this one first,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.320
then, you know, everyone would click the video off.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.760
I do play Warcraft on and off.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.000
I can't consistently play it.

26:27.640 --> 26:28.920
It can't hold me for that long.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.040
I play for a couple of weeks every few months, pretty much,

26:32.040 --> 26:33.960
just to see all the new stuff that's in the game.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.760
I'm not like a progression raider or something.

26:37.800 --> 26:42.280
The current expansion made a lot of improvements over the last expansion.

26:42.280 --> 26:46.920
The last one, Draenor, is the worst the game's ever been by a long shot.

26:46.920 --> 26:51.320
This one fixed a lot of those problems, but carried on a lot of those problems.

26:51.880 --> 26:57.720
The class halls are a major improvement over the Garrison of the Last expansion,

26:57.720 --> 26:59.560
which was, like, the main reason it was rubbish.

27:00.440 --> 27:03.800
Demon Hunters, I haven't- I've only played through the start area.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.000
They seem fine.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.320
I don't know, I don't have much to say about this.

27:08.120 --> 27:12.520
Illidan, well, of course, that's where they've really went wrong story-wise.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.760
They got rid of Froll, who was, for the uninitiated,

27:17.880 --> 27:22.520
Froll was like the Mary Sue of Chris Metzen within the World of Warcraft.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.960
He was orc Jesus, he typically gets referred to as,

27:26.680 --> 27:32.600
and was responsible or involved with every single major plot element in the entire game

27:32.600 --> 27:36.840
and would turn up when your raid group had just finished fighting a boss

27:36.840 --> 27:41.480
and he'd get the last kill in, or you'd be fighting another major lore character

27:41.480 --> 27:45.960
and then the game would just make you lose so that Froll could come and save you.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.800
And everyone hated Froll, so they just sort of benched him.

27:50.760 --> 27:55.080
But now they've replaced him with Illidan, who was always an interesting character

27:55.880 --> 28:02.280
in that he was pretty much just some average elf who was really incredibly driven

28:02.840 --> 28:09.000
and now they've made him elf Jesus, who was predestined to blah blah blah blah blah.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.040
And it's all incredibly boring and contrived.

28:12.040 --> 28:17.400
Like, for what a mess Warcraft's story is, there are occasionally good elements to it

28:17.400 --> 28:21.080
and Illidan's story was one of those and now they've ruined it.

28:21.080 --> 28:24.040
As for the characters who have been killed off, I think that was good.

28:24.040 --> 28:30.760
It gave a sense of actual, like, threat to the antagonists of this expansion.

28:30.760 --> 28:35.400
I mean, the orcs in the last expansion, they didn't kill anyone, I don't think,

28:35.400 --> 28:38.120
apart from characters who had just been introduced.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.960
They were, like, immediately beaten.

28:39.960 --> 28:44.680
But in this one, the Legion turn up and kill off a whole bunch of named lore characters.

28:44.680 --> 28:47.320
It's like, oh, actually, this is a threat this time.

28:47.320 --> 28:50.440
Um, so that was, uh, no one's still here, are they?

28:50.440 --> 28:54.360
Uh, so, okay, Gabi, since you're the only person who's still listening at this point.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.520
Heh heh heh heh.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.800
Thanks a lot for that question.

28:58.680 --> 29:01.800
Um, thanks a lot to everyone else who asked questions.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.720
Um, I couldn't put them all in, but any that I didn't answer here,

29:05.720 --> 29:07.720
I'll have a go at answering on Curious Cats.

29:08.120 --> 29:11.480
So, thanks a lot, everyone, and I'll see you next time.
