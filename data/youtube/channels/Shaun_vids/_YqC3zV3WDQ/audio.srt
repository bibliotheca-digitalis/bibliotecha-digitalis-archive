00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Hello there! This is a video about YouTuber Sargon of Akkad, and in particular, his video entitled,

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,440
"#FeministsForAutism".

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,120
Now, I'm somewhat of a newcomer to this whole YouTube thing, and until very recently, I didn't have any clue who Sargon was.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,120
But a few people recommended I take a look at Sargon after I recently made videos about TheAmazingGafiest and Thunderf00t,

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,720
including someone on Twitter who asked for a shout-out, so there you go, at nappsey743.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,720
So let's take a look at Sargon.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:42,320
Now, when I'm first looking at a new video, I find it helpful to ask a few simple questions about the argument the person is making in it,

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,520
and the means by which they do it.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,920
So, what's the ultimate point of Sargon's video?

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,920
That's to make fun of feminists.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,320
By what means does he do that?

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,720
Calling them autistic, which Sargon does at about eight minutes into his video by running down a list of common signs of autism,

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,120
and applying them to what he thinks feminism is.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,320
Number six.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,120
If you are socially challenged, and have an inability to read facial expressions and body language,

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:20,720
for example, if you can't tell when a consensual sexual encounter is being initiated without the explicit use of verbal cues,

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
you might have autism.

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
And he does that until the end of the video.

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,920
And I'm in familiar territory here, because I've seen a lot of this sort of thing before.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,720
All right, so we're basically 30 seconds into the video, and she's already proven to you, me, science, pretty much everybody, that she's a complete retard.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,220
Okay, all jokes aside, what the fuck is this bitch on any level whatsoever?

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,720
So she's basically fucking insane, you crazy fucking mug.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,720
This bitch is just dumb, period. Like, they are actually fucking retarded.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,220
Because, after all, that's all Sargon appears to be doing in his video, really.

25
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,220
The only difference here is the presentation.

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,720
The point is still that feminists are dumb and bad, and you're clever for not liking them.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,720
And you might be thinking, what about the first eight minutes of Sargon's video?

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,720
What does that contain?

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,220
It could be a series of well-researched points supporting and leading up to his conclusion.

30
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:22,720
Maybe this is what sets Sargon aside from being just another misogynist ranting about feminists on the internet.

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Or is it just a random assortment of unrelated arguments that only make sense if you stretch the meaning of the word feminism to an absurd degree?

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Well, gee, I wonder which it's gonna be.

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,720
So, let's take a look. We're gonna go through Sargon's video up to his,

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,720
feminists are all autistic bit, and look at each of his points in turn.

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,220
But first, just a brief note about his intro.

36
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,720
Now, the first fifteen seconds of Sargon's video is unintentionally rather funny. Let's take a watch.

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:07,220
["The First Noel"]

38
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,220
First off, I love the little title sequence in the desert thing.

39
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,220
It's like I'm playing a game of Civ or something. I'm watching the History channel, you know?

40
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,220
What am I gonna be learning about today?

41
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,720
And then that established tone is immediately undercut by this juvenile silliness.

42
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,720
First question, who is this person?

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Sargon uses this image here and also made it the thumbnail of the video,

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,220
so it's natural to assume this person features in the video,

45
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,720
or is at least representative of something that Sargon is talking about.

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,720
But aside from the thumbnail and the introduction, this person never features again.

47
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
So, what's going on?

48
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,220
Now, if we Google for this image, we see it posted in a mocking fashion by the

49
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,220
Meninist Twitter account, Meninist Tweet,

50
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,720
which posts a lot of lovely content, like laughing at a man calling a woman a cunt,

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,720
urging people to drink bleach, and worst of all, posting clips from Family Guy.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,220
And, funnily enough, calling feminists autistic.

53
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,220
And Sargon follows this account, so I'm just gonna assume that this,

54
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,720
or somewhere like this, is where he got the image from.

55
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,720
I'd wager neither Sargon nor his viewers actually know who this person is.

56
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I know who this person is, because I went and checked.

57
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,720
And I read back through a lot of their social media posts,

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,720
and never once saw anything directly relevant to anything that Sargon talks about in his video.

59
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,720
So, my conclusion here is that this person has nothing at all to do with Sargon's arguments.

60
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,220
They're only here because they were being used as the face for that day's anti-feminist two-minute hate.

61
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,720
So, we're only 15 seconds into the video, and we're hardly off to a good start.

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720
But maybe it'll pick up when Sargon starts talking.

63
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Let's take a listen.

64
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,220
But I will note here that Sargon presents his whole video sarcastically.

65
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,720
Which is quite helpful for us, really, as it gives us an insight into what he thinks feminists think.

66
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,720
If you're a feminist like me, you're probably aware that we live in a patriarchy.

67
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Now, for those who don't know, a patriarchy is a highly oppressive social system

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
that benefits men at the expense of women.

69
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,720
And this social system also oppresses men as well, by giving more money to women's healthcare.

70
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,720
For example, women in London live up to 12 years longer than men.

71
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,720
And that might sound like a good thing, but remember that's 12 more years of slavery that women have to endure.

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
They are simply not allowed to die.

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,720
It turns out that the patriarchy will spend almost 2 million more pounds on women's healthcare than men's

74
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
to ensure their suffering lasts well into their 80s.

75
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Of course, professional MRAs like Alan White, professor of men's health at Leeds University

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,720
and lead author of the recent EU Report on Men's Health, told the bureau that there was a real lack of initiatives

77
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
directed at the male population.

78
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Presumably because men's lives are so awesome, they simply don't need these initiatives.

79
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,720
And as agreed at the last International Patriarchy meeting, that money would be better spent oppressing women.

80
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Ha ha ha.

81
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Now, I knew that Sargon put foot wrong here when he cited a university professor, but we'll come back to that in a moment.

82
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Let's take a look at his point.

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
And it's easy enough to understand.

84
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Some areas of London spend more on health initiatives aimed at women than health initiatives aimed at men.

85
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,720
The question here is, why is Sargon mentioning this?

86
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,720
What does he think this challenges or contradicts?

87
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Well, he leads into the point by talking about patriarchy as defined by feminist theory,

88
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
so we'll assume that he thinks this challenges that idea.

89
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,720
And this is something you tend to see from a lot of anti-feminists.

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,720
When talking about gender equality, many male anti-feminists in particular tend to focus on topics

91
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
where men seem to be disadvantaged.

92
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,720
For example, in custody, education, or in particular here, healthcare.

93
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Their idea of a patriarchal society is one which favors men absolutely in every circumstance,

94
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,720
so to challenge that idea, they start citing exceptions to the rule.

95
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,720
And it would be a perfect argumentative strategy if that definition of patriarchy was the same one that feminists use.

96
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
But it's not.

97
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Mainstream feminist thought sees patriarchy as oppressive to both men and women,

98
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,720
which is something you'd think Sargon would understand since he said it, albeit sarcastically.

99
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Addressing men's involvement in gender equality by only stressing men's disadvantages

100
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
leads to very simplistic and misleading assumptions.

101
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
And that's not me talking there.

102
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:03,720
That's Professor Alan White, who in a study called The Role of Men in Gender Equalities says,

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Involving men in gender mainstreaming and gender equality strategies

104
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,720
bears the risk that gender is framed within certain terms in traditional sex role theory,

105
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
mainly reflecting topics where men seem to be disadvantaged,

106
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,720
for example custody, education, or health,

107
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
opening up anti-feminist discussion.

108
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Addressing men's involvement in gender equality by only stressing men's disadvantages

109
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,720
will lead to very simplistic and misleading assumptions.

110
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Therefore, one important preconception guiding the study

111
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,720
is to link pro-feminist, progressive, and critical men's policies and studies to gender equality policy,

112
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,720
while rejecting a male discrimination perspective pursued, for example, by men's rights groups

113
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,720
and those theories linked to this approach.

114
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,720
So, Sargon, two helpful hints from me to you.

115
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Firstly, when you're doing your anti-feminist bit, do not cite university professors,

116
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,720
especially ones who specialize in gender studies because they are nearly always pro-feminist.

117
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Secondly, in particular, do not cite university professors who have published material

118
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,720
that gives your exact anti-feminist argumentative strategy a swift kick in the bollocks.

119
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,720
And before we move on, let's just briefly take a look at this Health Initiatives report that Sargon is quoting from.

120
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:32,720
He presents it as though the reason certain areas of London have a large disparity in life expectancy between the sexes

121
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,720
is solely down to the amount of money spent on health initiatives.

122
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,720
But this is actually contradicted by the report.

123
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
When Sargon quotes,

124
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Women in London live up to twelve years longer than men.

125
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,720
He's talking about an area of London called cathedrals in Southwark,

126
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,720
which is the ward which has the largest disparity, which is twelve years.

127
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:03,720
However, as the report points out, Southwark spends nearly five million pounds more on men's health initiatives than women's.

128
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:12,720
They have the largest disparity in life expectancy, despite spending nearly three times as much on men's health than on women's health.

129
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Now, what that says to me is that the health initiative funding is reactive, not the direct cause.

130
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,720
They're spending more on men in that area because men have worse health in that area.

131
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:32,720
And the report does go into some reasons that men have lower life expectancies in the more deprived areas of London.

132
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:40,720
The economic climate, depression, suicide, a low level of council funding for health in general,

133
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,720
social stigma against men showing vulnerability, and asking for help.

134
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:55,720
And that last point is a perfect illustration of the feminist understanding of how patriarchy is harmful to both men and women.

135
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,720
And this point comes up again when Sargon brings up the disparities in the homeless rate and the suicide rate.

136
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Just because three out of four homeless people and suicide victims are men, that doesn't mean we need to talk about this.

137
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,720
I mean, have you considered that one in four homeless people and one in four suicide victims are important?

138
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,720
No, I didn't think you did, did you, Mr. Entitled? What a misogynist you are.

139
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,720
So let's take a brief look at the sources Sargon took these headlines from.

140
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,720
The homelessness headline comes from an opinion piece in the Telegraph,

141
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,720
complaining about a Press Association article published in The Guardian,

142
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,720
which itself was about a homelessness audit carried out by the charity HomelessLink.

143
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Peel that onion.

144
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Now the PA article chose to focus on the audit's findings that homeless women are more likely than homeless men

145
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,720
to use drugs like heroin and cocaine, and more likely to suffer from mental health issues.

146
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Which, according to the Telegraph opinion piece author Glenn Poole,

147
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,720
was the pro-feminist guardian being lazy, biased, and sexist against men.

148
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Now whatever we think of that, in the course of writing his piece,

149
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Glenn Poole contacted HomelessLink and got a response offering one explanation

150
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,720
for why the majority of homeless people who don't receive support are male.

151
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,720
And the HomelessLink spokesperson said,

152
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Homeless men are more likely than women to say they don't need support.

153
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Now the suicide headline is taken from a Guardian article,

154
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,720
and that's the same Guardian who were dishonest, pro-feminist shills about 15 seconds ago,

155
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,720
but here are being presented as a legitimate news source.

156
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,720
The Guardian article is about the disparity in the suicide rate between sexes in government statistics,

157
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,720
and it also talks about the launch of an investigation into the causes of suicide

158
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,720
by the University of Bristol and the charity Samaritans.

159
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,720
And they quote the head of policy and research at Samaritans on the reasons they believe

160
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,720
men tend to be higher risk of suicide than women.

161
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,720
In particular here, talking about working class men.

162
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,720
They will grow up expecting by the time they reach mid-life,

163
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,720
they'll have a wife who will look after them and a job for life in a male industry.

164
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,720
In reality, they may find that they reach middle age in a very different position.

165
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Society has this masculine ideal that people are expecting to live up to.

166
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Lots of that has to do with being a breadwinner.

167
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,720
When men don't live up to that, it can be quite devastating for them.

168
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
And the Guardian article goes on to say,

169
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Additional factors were the perception that it was more acceptable for men to turn to drink

170
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,720
or other risky behaviour to cope with difficulty,

171
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,720
and men being often reticent about talking about their feelings.

172
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Sargon, the issues you're pointing out that you think contradict feminist arguments

173
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
are themselves feminist issues.

174
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Feminists don't deny the fact that men are more likely to commit suicide or be homeless.

175
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
You know, they're not delusional.

176
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,720
They believe that one of the factors contributing to those disparities

177
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,720
is a difference in societal expectations of the genders.

178
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,720
In particular here, it's seen as less acceptable or appropriate for men to seek help when they need it.

179
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,720
This fixed notion of gender roles is one of the things that feminists generally want to see changed.

180
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,720
So then, let's somewhat reluctantly move on to autism.

181
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Because the problem is that we really don't understand autism in girls.

182
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
And that's a problem.

183
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,720
For example, when a large new study finds significant deviations in brain structure and behaviour

184
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
between boys and girls with autism,

185
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,720
you can tell that they are in fact total misogynist pricks

186
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,720
who are deeply anti-feminist and, of course, by definition, anti-woman.

187
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Dr Vinod Menon, a professor of misogyny and oppression at the Stanford School of Medicine

188
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,720
and one of the study's authors, told the Huffington Post that

189
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,720
girls with autism display autism symptoms differently

190
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,720
and this may lead them to be underdiagnosed or may make it harder for them to get the most appropriate treatment.

191
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,720
As if his single study overturns 30 years of feminist scientific research

192
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,720
establishing that there are exactly zero differences between men and women on both a biological and social level.

193
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,720
In this study, while the boys and girls had similar IQ scores

194
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,720
as well as comparable social behaviours and communication skills,

195
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,720
the boys showed significantly more repetitive and restrictive behaviours than the girls did.

196
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Because traditional science, or surrence, is a patriarchal male social construct

197
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,720
specifically designed to exclude women and ensure that men always score better in anything that they do.

198
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,720
And it's this very same surrence that goes on to show that the analysis of the brain scans

199
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,720
reveals that autistic boys have different brain patterns in regions associated with motor function

200
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,720
and the planning of motor activities. What this is, is a patriarchal conspiracy.

201
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,720
So at this point in the video, I started wondering who Sargon is actually arguing against.

202
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:17,720
He's reading out a neutral voiced news report about a scientific study from the science section of the Huffington Post

203
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,720
and just inserting sarcastic jabs at feminism seemingly at random.

204
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,720
And just personally, as a new viewer of Sargon's, I had no idea what he was talking about here.

205
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
There's no actual mention of feminism in the article

206
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,720
and Sargon doesn't mention anyone who actually agrees with what he's sarcastically saying.

207
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Maybe it's just my ignorance, but I have never seen a feminist ever argue

208
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,720
that males and females with autism have identical biologies and brain patterns.

209
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,720
You know, that school of feminist thought must have passed me by.

210
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,720
I don't think I've ever even seen a feminist argue that there are zero social differences between the sexes.

211
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,720
I thought feminism existed because of these social differences in an attempt to redress the imbalance.

212
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,720
You know, who is the person who actually said the things that Sargon is sarcastically arguing against?

213
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Was it this person?

214
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Or how about this person?

215
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Now, I don't really know who this person is. It's Steve Shives.

216
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,720
I only really include him here because Sargon took a pop at him earlier in the video.

217
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,720
So I went and watched Steve Shives' video and he doesn't say anything about autism either.

218
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,720
However, reading the comments on Sargon's video made me realize what he was doing.

219
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Having no actual person to argue against, he's simply inviting his audience to invent one.

220
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Imagine a feminist scientist who's so stupid and irrational in their crusade for gender equality

221
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,720
that they want more women to have autism just to be equal with men.

222
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Imagine how stupid that person is who I just invented.

223
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Or have I spoken too soon?

224
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm going to level with you and give you the absolute truth of the matter.

225
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Autism is a feminist issue.

226
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,720
One out of every 68 children today in the United States receives a diagnosis of autism.

227
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,720
And of course, one out of 42 of them is male.

228
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,720
And 100% of them have a tumblr account.

229
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,720
And many people think that autism is the fastest growing developmental disability in the US.

230
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,720
And there's no cure for autism.

231
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,720
So this piece that Sargon's quoting from is by Esther Nelson from the website Feminism and Religion.

232
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,720
So is this person the real, irrational feminist scientist that Sargon appears to be arguing with?

233
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Well, let's take a look at her article.

234
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,720
The first thing to note here is that it's speculative.

235
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Note the question mark in the title indicating it's intended as a question and not, as Sargon said,

236
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
a statement of absolute truth.

237
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Now, nowhere in this article does Nelson talk about how autism manifests differently in boys and girls.

238
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Nor does she talk about the statistical disparity between the sexes except to mention it as a statement of fact.

239
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,720
The rest of the article is about behaviors in possibly undiagnosed, high-functioning autistic adult males

240
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,720
and patriarchal interpretations of those behaviors.

241
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,720
I.e. she's coming at this from a totally different angle than Sargon.

242
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,720
She's certainly not arguing for increased diagnosis of autism in women.

243
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,720
So we can cross her off the list of possible suspects for whoever Sargon is arguing with.

244
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,720
So, this raises a question. Why is her article in Sargon's video?

245
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,720
It doesn't seem particularly relevant beyond being generally about autism.

246
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,720
A cynic would probably point out that if you Google feminist and autism, it's, you know, one of the first links that comes up,

247
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,720
so it being in there is probably more to do with convenience than relevance.

248
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,720
However, this is where Sargon pulls his list of common signifiers of autism from.

249
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Let's watch him run down the list. And just a note of warning before he begins here,

250
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,720
you might want to hold your sides lest they split.

251
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,720
There are eight major signs of autism that you can identify in your friends, your family, your colleagues, your co-workers,

252
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,720
perhaps even your business or your organization, or even a social movement you happen to identify with.

253
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,720
The first is an extreme sensitivity to criticism.

254
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,720
If you feel that a different opinion makes you want to block that person,

255
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:57,720
and everyone who has ever spoken to that person, possibly via use of a blockbot on social media, you might have autism.

256
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,720
The second one is that you have rigid thinking. You think that things are either right or they are wrong,

257
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,720
and there is no gray area between them. For example, you might say that you're either a feminist or you're a sexist.

258
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,720
If you reduce everything to these binary criteria, you might have autism.

259
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Number three is that you are easily distressed when things aren't right.

260
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Meltdowns, loss of control often happen.

261
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:28,720
For example, if you need safe spaces to be able to discuss anything that might slightly upset you, you might have autism.

262
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,720
In fact, I think I'll spare you the pain and we'll just fast forward the rest of them,

263
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,720
because he does this for a very long time and it's very tedious.

264
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,720
So there we go, we have finally reached the point of the video calling feminists autistic.

265
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,720
So what was all that other stuff that came before it?

266
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,720
You know, all the misrepresented or misunderstood news stories and studies.

267
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,720
None of that has anything to do with this, but it does serve a purpose for Sargon, and it's this.

268
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,720
It's to trick his audience into thinking they're not watching this.

269
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
So she's basically fucking insane, you crazy fucking mug.

270
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,720
This bitch is just dumb, period. Like, they are actually fucking retarded.

271
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Because they are watching that.

272
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,720
And to close my video here, I'm just gonna briefly look at this list myself.

273
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,720
But before I do, please understand I would never consciously use autism as an insult to describe people who disagree with me.

274
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,720
I think it's crass and childish and insulting to people who actually have autism.

275
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:39,720
What I'm about to do is show how easily Sargon's stretched interpretations of these behavioral signifiers can be turned back on him.

276
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,720
I'm not calling him autistic. Offensive and lazy, maybe, but not autistic.

277
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Extreme sensitivity to criticism.

278
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:56,720
For example, if you're so afraid of criticism that you refuse to listen to arguments that criticize your beliefs because they're too long,

279
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,720
you might be Sargon of Akkad.

280
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Endless talking about or bulldogging a subject, usually in a monotone.

281
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:13,720
For example, if you find yourself endlessly talking in a monotone about how stupid feminists are, you might be Sargon of Akkad.

282
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Often highly intelligent, but for... actually, this one doesn't count.

283
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Lack of empathy.

284
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,720
For example, if you think it's okay to use a developmental disorder that real people actually struggle with as an insult for people you don't like,

285
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:36,720
if you think it's okay to use a photograph of an unrelated person as a clickbait thumbnail on a video calling people autistic,

286
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,720
if you defended Elliot Rodger, and yes, Sargon defended Elliot Rodger...

287
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,720
And no, it's not all men who act this way. But you know what? It's way too f***ing many.

288
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Which is ironic considering that before your stupid social justice feminine bullshit, it didn't happen on this scale.

289
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,720
It's crazy! This is a disease of the modern age.

290
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:14,720
You are responsible for perpetuating it by disenfranchising these poor f***ing guys who don't have any options left.

291
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:25,720
When someone takes the option of absolutes insanely last resort, you have to wonder what kind of system is producing them.

292
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,720
And I tell you what, Lacey, it is a f***ing feminist system that's doing this!

293
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,720
If you defended Elliot Rodger... well, you get the point.

294
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Now I know there's gonna be a few people who comment on this video saying,

295
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:49,720
It was a joke. Sargon's just joking. It's a joke video. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's all a joke.

296
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,720
My response to that is, no it's not.
