0	7280	Hello there! This is a video about YouTuber Sargon of Akkad, and in particular, his video entitled,
7280	10440	"#FeministsForAutism".
10440	18120	Now, I'm somewhat of a newcomer to this whole YouTube thing, and until very recently, I didn't have any clue who Sargon was.
18120	25120	But a few people recommended I take a look at Sargon after I recently made videos about TheAmazingGafiest and Thunderf00t,
25520	31720	including someone on Twitter who asked for a shout-out, so there you go, at nappsey743.
31720	33720	So let's take a look at Sargon.
33720	42320	Now, when I'm first looking at a new video, I find it helpful to ask a few simple questions about the argument the person is making in it,
42320	44520	and the means by which they do it.
44520	47920	So, what's the ultimate point of Sargon's video?
47920	50920	That's to make fun of feminists.
50920	53320	By what means does he do that?
53520	61720	Calling them autistic, which Sargon does at about eight minutes into his video by running down a list of common signs of autism,
61720	65120	and applying them to what he thinks feminism is.
65120	66320	Number six.
66320	72120	If you are socially challenged, and have an inability to read facial expressions and body language,
72120	80720	for example, if you can't tell when a consensual sexual encounter is being initiated without the explicit use of verbal cues,
80720	82720	you might have autism.
82720	85520	And he does that until the end of the video.
85520	89920	And I'm in familiar territory here, because I've seen a lot of this sort of thing before.
89920	96720	All right, so we're basically 30 seconds into the video, and she's already proven to you, me, science, pretty much everybody, that she's a complete retard.
96720	101220	Okay, all jokes aside, what the fuck is this bitch on any level whatsoever?
101220	104720	So she's basically fucking insane, you crazy fucking mug.
104720	108720	This bitch is just dumb, period. Like, they are actually fucking retarded.
108720	113220	Because, after all, that's all Sargon appears to be doing in his video, really.
113220	116220	The only difference here is the presentation.
116220	121720	The point is still that feminists are dumb and bad, and you're clever for not liking them.
121720	126720	And you might be thinking, what about the first eight minutes of Sargon's video?
126720	128720	What does that contain?
128720	135220	It could be a series of well-researched points supporting and leading up to his conclusion.
135220	142720	Maybe this is what sets Sargon aside from being just another misogynist ranting about feminists on the internet.
142720	151720	Or is it just a random assortment of unrelated arguments that only make sense if you stretch the meaning of the word feminism to an absurd degree?
151720	154720	Well, gee, I wonder which it's gonna be.
154720	159720	So, let's take a look. We're gonna go through Sargon's video up to his,
159720	164720	feminists are all autistic bit, and look at each of his points in turn.
164720	168220	But first, just a brief note about his intro.
168220	174720	Now, the first fifteen seconds of Sargon's video is unintentionally rather funny. Let's take a watch.
174720	187220	["The First Noel"]
187220	191220	First off, I love the little title sequence in the desert thing.
191220	196220	It's like I'm playing a game of Civ or something. I'm watching the History channel, you know?
196220	198220	What am I gonna be learning about today?
198220	203720	And then that established tone is immediately undercut by this juvenile silliness.
203720	206720	First question, who is this person?
206720	211720	Sargon uses this image here and also made it the thumbnail of the video,
211720	215220	so it's natural to assume this person features in the video,
215220	219720	or is at least representative of something that Sargon is talking about.
219720	224720	But aside from the thumbnail and the introduction, this person never features again.
224720	226720	So, what's going on?
226720	231220	Now, if we Google for this image, we see it posted in a mocking fashion by the
231220	235220	Meninist Twitter account, Meninist Tweet,
235220	240720	which posts a lot of lovely content, like laughing at a man calling a woman a cunt,
240720	246720	urging people to drink bleach, and worst of all, posting clips from Family Guy.
246720	251220	And, funnily enough, calling feminists autistic.
251220	256220	And Sargon follows this account, so I'm just gonna assume that this,
256220	259720	or somewhere like this, is where he got the image from.
259720	265720	I'd wager neither Sargon nor his viewers actually know who this person is.
265720	269720	I know who this person is, because I went and checked.
269720	272720	And I read back through a lot of their social media posts,
272720	278720	and never once saw anything directly relevant to anything that Sargon talks about in his video.
278720	284720	So, my conclusion here is that this person has nothing at all to do with Sargon's arguments.
284720	291220	They're only here because they were being used as the face for that day's anti-feminist two-minute hate.
291220	296720	So, we're only 15 seconds into the video, and we're hardly off to a good start.
296720	300720	But maybe it'll pick up when Sargon starts talking.
300720	302720	Let's take a listen.
302720	307220	But I will note here that Sargon presents his whole video sarcastically.
307220	313720	Which is quite helpful for us, really, as it gives us an insight into what he thinks feminists think.
314220	317720	If you're a feminist like me, you're probably aware that we live in a patriarchy.
317720	322720	Now, for those who don't know, a patriarchy is a highly oppressive social system
322720	324720	that benefits men at the expense of women.
324720	329720	And this social system also oppresses men as well, by giving more money to women's healthcare.
329720	333720	For example, women in London live up to 12 years longer than men.
333720	339720	And that might sound like a good thing, but remember that's 12 more years of slavery that women have to endure.
339720	342720	They are simply not allowed to die.
342720	348720	It turns out that the patriarchy will spend almost 2 million more pounds on women's healthcare than men's
348720	351720	to ensure their suffering lasts well into their 80s.
351720	356720	Of course, professional MRAs like Alan White, professor of men's health at Leeds University
356720	361720	and lead author of the recent EU Report on Men's Health, told the bureau that there was a real lack of initiatives
361720	363720	directed at the male population.
363720	368720	Presumably because men's lives are so awesome, they simply don't need these initiatives.
368720	374720	And as agreed at the last International Patriarchy meeting, that money would be better spent oppressing women.
374720	376720	Ha ha ha.
377720	384720	Now, I knew that Sargon put foot wrong here when he cited a university professor, but we'll come back to that in a moment.
384720	386720	Let's take a look at his point.
386720	388720	And it's easy enough to understand.
388720	395720	Some areas of London spend more on health initiatives aimed at women than health initiatives aimed at men.
395720	399720	The question here is, why is Sargon mentioning this?
399720	403720	What does he think this challenges or contradicts?
403720	408720	Well, he leads into the point by talking about patriarchy as defined by feminist theory,
408720	412720	so we'll assume that he thinks this challenges that idea.
412720	416720	And this is something you tend to see from a lot of anti-feminists.
416720	423720	When talking about gender equality, many male anti-feminists in particular tend to focus on topics
423720	425720	where men seem to be disadvantaged.
425720	431720	For example, in custody, education, or in particular here, healthcare.
431720	438720	Their idea of a patriarchal society is one which favors men absolutely in every circumstance,
438720	443720	so to challenge that idea, they start citing exceptions to the rule.
443720	450720	And it would be a perfect argumentative strategy if that definition of patriarchy was the same one that feminists use.
450720	452720	But it's not.
452720	457720	Mainstream feminist thought sees patriarchy as oppressive to both men and women,
457720	464720	which is something you'd think Sargon would understand since he said it, albeit sarcastically.
464720	469720	Addressing men's involvement in gender equality by only stressing men's disadvantages
469720	473720	leads to very simplistic and misleading assumptions.
473720	475720	And that's not me talking there.
475720	483720	That's Professor Alan White, who in a study called The Role of Men in Gender Equalities says,
483720	487720	Involving men in gender mainstreaming and gender equality strategies
487720	492720	bears the risk that gender is framed within certain terms in traditional sex role theory,
492720	496720	mainly reflecting topics where men seem to be disadvantaged,
496720	499720	for example custody, education, or health,
499720	502720	opening up anti-feminist discussion.
502720	506720	Addressing men's involvement in gender equality by only stressing men's disadvantages
506720	509720	will lead to very simplistic and misleading assumptions.
509720	512720	Therefore, one important preconception guiding the study
512720	519720	is to link pro-feminist, progressive, and critical men's policies and studies to gender equality policy,
519720	525720	while rejecting a male discrimination perspective pursued, for example, by men's rights groups
525720	528720	and those theories linked to this approach.
528720	532720	So, Sargon, two helpful hints from me to you.
532720	539720	Firstly, when you're doing your anti-feminist bit, do not cite university professors,
539720	546720	especially ones who specialize in gender studies because they are nearly always pro-feminist.
546720	551720	Secondly, in particular, do not cite university professors who have published material
551720	558720	that gives your exact anti-feminist argumentative strategy a swift kick in the bollocks.
558720	565720	And before we move on, let's just briefly take a look at this Health Initiatives report that Sargon is quoting from.
565720	572720	He presents it as though the reason certain areas of London have a large disparity in life expectancy between the sexes
572720	577720	is solely down to the amount of money spent on health initiatives.
577720	580720	But this is actually contradicted by the report.
580720	582720	When Sargon quotes,
582720	585720	Women in London live up to twelve years longer than men.
585720	590720	He's talking about an area of London called cathedrals in Southwark,
590720	594720	which is the ward which has the largest disparity, which is twelve years.
594720	603720	However, as the report points out, Southwark spends nearly five million pounds more on men's health initiatives than women's.
603720	612720	They have the largest disparity in life expectancy, despite spending nearly three times as much on men's health than on women's health.
612720	619720	Now, what that says to me is that the health initiative funding is reactive, not the direct cause.
619720	625720	They're spending more on men in that area because men have worse health in that area.
625720	632720	And the report does go into some reasons that men have lower life expectancies in the more deprived areas of London.
632720	640720	The economic climate, depression, suicide, a low level of council funding for health in general,
640720	646720	social stigma against men showing vulnerability, and asking for help.
646720	655720	And that last point is a perfect illustration of the feminist understanding of how patriarchy is harmful to both men and women.
655720	661720	And this point comes up again when Sargon brings up the disparities in the homeless rate and the suicide rate.
662720	667720	Just because three out of four homeless people and suicide victims are men, that doesn't mean we need to talk about this.
667720	674720	I mean, have you considered that one in four homeless people and one in four suicide victims are important?
674720	680720	No, I didn't think you did, did you, Mr. Entitled? What a misogynist you are.
680720	684720	So let's take a brief look at the sources Sargon took these headlines from.
684720	689720	The homelessness headline comes from an opinion piece in the Telegraph,
689720	694720	complaining about a Press Association article published in The Guardian,
694720	701720	which itself was about a homelessness audit carried out by the charity HomelessLink.
701720	703720	Peel that onion.
703720	709720	Now the PA article chose to focus on the audit's findings that homeless women are more likely than homeless men
710720	715720	to use drugs like heroin and cocaine, and more likely to suffer from mental health issues.
715720	718720	Which, according to the Telegraph opinion piece author Glenn Poole,
718720	724720	was the pro-feminist guardian being lazy, biased, and sexist against men.
724720	728720	Now whatever we think of that, in the course of writing his piece,
728720	733720	Glenn Poole contacted HomelessLink and got a response offering one explanation
733720	737720	for why the majority of homeless people who don't receive support are male.
737720	740720	And the HomelessLink spokesperson said,
740720	745720	Homeless men are more likely than women to say they don't need support.
745720	749720	Now the suicide headline is taken from a Guardian article,
749720	754720	and that's the same Guardian who were dishonest, pro-feminist shills about 15 seconds ago,
754720	758720	but here are being presented as a legitimate news source.
758720	764720	The Guardian article is about the disparity in the suicide rate between sexes in government statistics,
764720	769720	and it also talks about the launch of an investigation into the causes of suicide
769720	773720	by the University of Bristol and the charity Samaritans.
773720	778720	And they quote the head of policy and research at Samaritans on the reasons they believe
778720	781720	men tend to be higher risk of suicide than women.
781720	785720	In particular here, talking about working class men.
785720	788720	They will grow up expecting by the time they reach mid-life,
788720	792720	they'll have a wife who will look after them and a job for life in a male industry.
792720	797720	In reality, they may find that they reach middle age in a very different position.
797720	801720	Society has this masculine ideal that people are expecting to live up to.
801720	804720	Lots of that has to do with being a breadwinner.
804720	809720	When men don't live up to that, it can be quite devastating for them.
809720	811720	And the Guardian article goes on to say,
811720	816720	Additional factors were the perception that it was more acceptable for men to turn to drink
816720	819720	or other risky behaviour to cope with difficulty,
820720	825720	and men being often reticent about talking about their feelings.
825720	831720	Sargon, the issues you're pointing out that you think contradict feminist arguments
831720	834720	are themselves feminist issues.
834720	839720	Feminists don't deny the fact that men are more likely to commit suicide or be homeless.
839720	841720	You know, they're not delusional.
841720	845720	They believe that one of the factors contributing to those disparities
845720	849720	is a difference in societal expectations of the genders.
849720	855720	In particular here, it's seen as less acceptable or appropriate for men to seek help when they need it.
855720	862720	This fixed notion of gender roles is one of the things that feminists generally want to see changed.
862720	867720	So then, let's somewhat reluctantly move on to autism.
867720	871720	Because the problem is that we really don't understand autism in girls.
871720	873720	And that's a problem.
873720	878720	For example, when a large new study finds significant deviations in brain structure and behaviour
878720	880720	between boys and girls with autism,
880720	885720	you can tell that they are in fact total misogynist pricks
885720	890720	who are deeply anti-feminist and, of course, by definition, anti-woman.
890720	896720	Dr Vinod Menon, a professor of misogyny and oppression at the Stanford School of Medicine
896720	899720	and one of the study's authors, told the Huffington Post that
899720	902720	girls with autism display autism symptoms differently
902720	908720	and this may lead them to be underdiagnosed or may make it harder for them to get the most appropriate treatment.
908720	914720	As if his single study overturns 30 years of feminist scientific research
914720	921720	establishing that there are exactly zero differences between men and women on both a biological and social level.
921720	924720	In this study, while the boys and girls had similar IQ scores
924720	928720	as well as comparable social behaviours and communication skills,
928720	933720	the boys showed significantly more repetitive and restrictive behaviours than the girls did.
933720	940720	Because traditional science, or surrence, is a patriarchal male social construct
940720	947720	specifically designed to exclude women and ensure that men always score better in anything that they do.
947720	952720	And it's this very same surrence that goes on to show that the analysis of the brain scans
952720	957720	reveals that autistic boys have different brain patterns in regions associated with motor function
957720	963720	and the planning of motor activities. What this is, is a patriarchal conspiracy.
963720	969720	So at this point in the video, I started wondering who Sargon is actually arguing against.
969720	977720	He's reading out a neutral voiced news report about a scientific study from the science section of the Huffington Post
977720	982720	and just inserting sarcastic jabs at feminism seemingly at random.
982720	988720	And just personally, as a new viewer of Sargon's, I had no idea what he was talking about here.
988720	992720	There's no actual mention of feminism in the article
992720	997720	and Sargon doesn't mention anyone who actually agrees with what he's sarcastically saying.
997720	1002720	Maybe it's just my ignorance, but I have never seen a feminist ever argue
1002720	1007720	that males and females with autism have identical biologies and brain patterns.
1007720	1011720	You know, that school of feminist thought must have passed me by.
1012720	1019720	I don't think I've ever even seen a feminist argue that there are zero social differences between the sexes.
1019720	1026720	I thought feminism existed because of these social differences in an attempt to redress the imbalance.
1026720	1033720	You know, who is the person who actually said the things that Sargon is sarcastically arguing against?
1033720	1035720	Was it this person?
1036720	1038720	Or how about this person?
1038720	1043720	Now, I don't really know who this person is. It's Steve Shives.
1043720	1049720	I only really include him here because Sargon took a pop at him earlier in the video.
1049720	1055720	So I went and watched Steve Shives' video and he doesn't say anything about autism either.
1055720	1061720	However, reading the comments on Sargon's video made me realize what he was doing.
1061720	1067720	Having no actual person to argue against, he's simply inviting his audience to invent one.
1067720	1074720	Imagine a feminist scientist who's so stupid and irrational in their crusade for gender equality
1074720	1079720	that they want more women to have autism just to be equal with men.
1079720	1084720	Imagine how stupid that person is who I just invented.
1084720	1087720	Or have I spoken too soon?
1087720	1091720	I'm going to level with you and give you the absolute truth of the matter.
1091720	1094720	Autism is a feminist issue.
1094720	1099720	One out of every 68 children today in the United States receives a diagnosis of autism.
1099720	1103720	And of course, one out of 42 of them is male.
1103720	1106720	And 100% of them have a tumblr account.
1114720	1120720	And many people think that autism is the fastest growing developmental disability in the US.
1120720	1123720	And there's no cure for autism.
1123720	1130720	So this piece that Sargon's quoting from is by Esther Nelson from the website Feminism and Religion.
1130720	1136720	So is this person the real, irrational feminist scientist that Sargon appears to be arguing with?
1136720	1139720	Well, let's take a look at her article.
1139720	1143720	The first thing to note here is that it's speculative.
1143720	1150720	Note the question mark in the title indicating it's intended as a question and not, as Sargon said,
1150720	1152720	a statement of absolute truth.
1152720	1159720	Now, nowhere in this article does Nelson talk about how autism manifests differently in boys and girls.
1159720	1166720	Nor does she talk about the statistical disparity between the sexes except to mention it as a statement of fact.
1166720	1173720	The rest of the article is about behaviors in possibly undiagnosed, high-functioning autistic adult males
1173720	1177720	and patriarchal interpretations of those behaviors.
1177720	1182720	I.e. she's coming at this from a totally different angle than Sargon.
1182720	1187720	She's certainly not arguing for increased diagnosis of autism in women.
1187720	1193720	So we can cross her off the list of possible suspects for whoever Sargon is arguing with.
1193720	1198720	So, this raises a question. Why is her article in Sargon's video?
1198720	1203720	It doesn't seem particularly relevant beyond being generally about autism.
1203720	1210720	A cynic would probably point out that if you Google feminist and autism, it's, you know, one of the first links that comes up,
1210720	1215720	so it being in there is probably more to do with convenience than relevance.
1215720	1220720	However, this is where Sargon pulls his list of common signifiers of autism from.
1220720	1225720	Let's watch him run down the list. And just a note of warning before he begins here,
1225720	1229720	you might want to hold your sides lest they split.
1229720	1235720	There are eight major signs of autism that you can identify in your friends, your family, your colleagues, your co-workers,
1235720	1241720	perhaps even your business or your organization, or even a social movement you happen to identify with.
1241720	1244720	The first is an extreme sensitivity to criticism.
1245720	1249720	If you feel that a different opinion makes you want to block that person,
1249720	1257720	and everyone who has ever spoken to that person, possibly via use of a blockbot on social media, you might have autism.
1257720	1262720	The second one is that you have rigid thinking. You think that things are either right or they are wrong,
1262720	1269720	and there is no gray area between them. For example, you might say that you're either a feminist or you're a sexist.
1269720	1273720	If you reduce everything to these binary criteria, you might have autism.
1274720	1277720	Number three is that you are easily distressed when things aren't right.
1277720	1280720	Meltdowns, loss of control often happen.
1280720	1288720	For example, if you need safe spaces to be able to discuss anything that might slightly upset you, you might have autism.
1288720	1292720	In fact, I think I'll spare you the pain and we'll just fast forward the rest of them,
1292720	1295720	because he does this for a very long time and it's very tedious.
1295720	1302720	So there we go, we have finally reached the point of the video calling feminists autistic.
1302720	1305720	So what was all that other stuff that came before it?
1305720	1310720	You know, all the misrepresented or misunderstood news stories and studies.
1310720	1317720	None of that has anything to do with this, but it does serve a purpose for Sargon, and it's this.
1317720	1322720	It's to trick his audience into thinking they're not watching this.
1322720	1326720	So she's basically fucking insane, you crazy fucking mug.
1326720	1330720	This bitch is just dumb, period. Like, they are actually fucking retarded.
1330720	1332720	Because they are watching that.
1332720	1337720	And to close my video here, I'm just gonna briefly look at this list myself.
1337720	1344720	But before I do, please understand I would never consciously use autism as an insult to describe people who disagree with me.
1344720	1350720	I think it's crass and childish and insulting to people who actually have autism.
1350720	1359720	What I'm about to do is show how easily Sargon's stretched interpretations of these behavioral signifiers can be turned back on him.
1359720	1365720	I'm not calling him autistic. Offensive and lazy, maybe, but not autistic.
1365720	1368720	Extreme sensitivity to criticism.
1368720	1376720	For example, if you're so afraid of criticism that you refuse to listen to arguments that criticize your beliefs because they're too long,
1376720	1379720	you might be Sargon of Akkad.
1379720	1384720	Endless talking about or bulldogging a subject, usually in a monotone.
1384720	1393720	For example, if you find yourself endlessly talking in a monotone about how stupid feminists are, you might be Sargon of Akkad.
1393720	1398720	Often highly intelligent, but for... actually, this one doesn't count.
1398720	1400720	Lack of empathy.
1400720	1408720	For example, if you think it's okay to use a developmental disorder that real people actually struggle with as an insult for people you don't like,
1408720	1416720	if you think it's okay to use a photograph of an unrelated person as a clickbait thumbnail on a video calling people autistic,
1416720	1422720	if you defended Elliot Rodger, and yes, Sargon defended Elliot Rodger...
1422720	1428720	And no, it's not all men who act this way. But you know what? It's way too f***ing many.
1428720	1437720	Which is ironic considering that before your stupid social justice feminine bullshit, it didn't happen on this scale.
1437720	1442720	It's crazy! This is a disease of the modern age.
1442720	1454720	You are responsible for perpetuating it by disenfranchising these poor f***ing guys who don't have any options left.
1454720	1465720	When someone takes the option of absolutes insanely last resort, you have to wonder what kind of system is producing them.
1465720	1471720	And I tell you what, Lacey, it is a f***ing feminist system that's doing this!
1471720	1477720	If you defended Elliot Rodger... well, you get the point.
1477720	1481720	Now I know there's gonna be a few people who comment on this video saying,
1481720	1489720	It was a joke. Sargon's just joking. It's a joke video. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's all a joke.
1489720	1493720	My response to that is, no it's not.
