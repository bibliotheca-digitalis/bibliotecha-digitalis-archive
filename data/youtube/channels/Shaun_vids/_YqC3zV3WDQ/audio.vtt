00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
Hello there! This is a video about YouTuber Sargon of Akkad, and in particular, his video entitled,

00:07.280 --> 00:10.440
"#FeministsForAutism".

00:10.440 --> 00:18.120
Now, I'm somewhat of a newcomer to this whole YouTube thing, and until very recently, I didn't have any clue who Sargon was.

00:18.120 --> 00:25.120
But a few people recommended I take a look at Sargon after I recently made videos about TheAmazingGafiest and Thunderf00t,

00:25.520 --> 00:31.720
including someone on Twitter who asked for a shout-out, so there you go, at nappsey743.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.720
So let's take a look at Sargon.

00:33.720 --> 00:42.320
Now, when I'm first looking at a new video, I find it helpful to ask a few simple questions about the argument the person is making in it,

00:42.320 --> 00:44.520
and the means by which they do it.

00:44.520 --> 00:47.920
So, what's the ultimate point of Sargon's video?

00:47.920 --> 00:50.920
That's to make fun of feminists.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.320
By what means does he do that?

00:53.520 --> 01:01.720
Calling them autistic, which Sargon does at about eight minutes into his video by running down a list of common signs of autism,

01:01.720 --> 01:05.120
and applying them to what he thinks feminism is.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.320
Number six.

01:06.320 --> 01:12.120
If you are socially challenged, and have an inability to read facial expressions and body language,

01:12.120 --> 01:20.720
for example, if you can't tell when a consensual sexual encounter is being initiated without the explicit use of verbal cues,

01:20.720 --> 01:22.720
you might have autism.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.520
And he does that until the end of the video.

01:25.520 --> 01:29.920
And I'm in familiar territory here, because I've seen a lot of this sort of thing before.

01:29.920 --> 01:36.720
All right, so we're basically 30 seconds into the video, and she's already proven to you, me, science, pretty much everybody, that she's a complete retard.

01:36.720 --> 01:41.220
Okay, all jokes aside, what the fuck is this bitch on any level whatsoever?

01:41.220 --> 01:44.720
So she's basically fucking insane, you crazy fucking mug.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.720
This bitch is just dumb, period. Like, they are actually fucking retarded.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.220
Because, after all, that's all Sargon appears to be doing in his video, really.

01:53.220 --> 01:56.220
The only difference here is the presentation.

01:56.220 --> 02:01.720
The point is still that feminists are dumb and bad, and you're clever for not liking them.

02:01.720 --> 02:06.720
And you might be thinking, what about the first eight minutes of Sargon's video?

02:06.720 --> 02:08.720
What does that contain?

02:08.720 --> 02:15.220
It could be a series of well-researched points supporting and leading up to his conclusion.

02:15.220 --> 02:22.720
Maybe this is what sets Sargon aside from being just another misogynist ranting about feminists on the internet.

02:22.720 --> 02:31.720
Or is it just a random assortment of unrelated arguments that only make sense if you stretch the meaning of the word feminism to an absurd degree?

02:31.720 --> 02:34.720
Well, gee, I wonder which it's gonna be.

02:34.720 --> 02:39.720
So, let's take a look. We're gonna go through Sargon's video up to his,

02:39.720 --> 02:44.720
feminists are all autistic bit, and look at each of his points in turn.

02:44.720 --> 02:48.220
But first, just a brief note about his intro.

02:48.220 --> 02:54.720
Now, the first fifteen seconds of Sargon's video is unintentionally rather funny. Let's take a watch.

02:54.720 --> 03:07.220
["The First Noel"]

03:07.220 --> 03:11.220
First off, I love the little title sequence in the desert thing.

03:11.220 --> 03:16.220
It's like I'm playing a game of Civ or something. I'm watching the History channel, you know?

03:16.220 --> 03:18.220
What am I gonna be learning about today?

03:18.220 --> 03:23.720
And then that established tone is immediately undercut by this juvenile silliness.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.720
First question, who is this person?

03:26.720 --> 03:31.720
Sargon uses this image here and also made it the thumbnail of the video,

03:31.720 --> 03:35.220
so it's natural to assume this person features in the video,

03:35.220 --> 03:39.720
or is at least representative of something that Sargon is talking about.

03:39.720 --> 03:44.720
But aside from the thumbnail and the introduction, this person never features again.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.720
So, what's going on?

03:46.720 --> 03:51.220
Now, if we Google for this image, we see it posted in a mocking fashion by the

03:51.220 --> 03:55.220
Meninist Twitter account, Meninist Tweet,

03:55.220 --> 04:00.720
which posts a lot of lovely content, like laughing at a man calling a woman a cunt,

04:00.720 --> 04:06.720
urging people to drink bleach, and worst of all, posting clips from Family Guy.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.220
And, funnily enough, calling feminists autistic.

04:11.220 --> 04:16.220
And Sargon follows this account, so I'm just gonna assume that this,

04:16.220 --> 04:19.720
or somewhere like this, is where he got the image from.

04:19.720 --> 04:25.720
I'd wager neither Sargon nor his viewers actually know who this person is.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.720
I know who this person is, because I went and checked.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.720
And I read back through a lot of their social media posts,

04:32.720 --> 04:38.720
and never once saw anything directly relevant to anything that Sargon talks about in his video.

04:38.720 --> 04:44.720
So, my conclusion here is that this person has nothing at all to do with Sargon's arguments.

04:44.720 --> 04:51.220
They're only here because they were being used as the face for that day's anti-feminist two-minute hate.

04:51.220 --> 04:56.720
So, we're only 15 seconds into the video, and we're hardly off to a good start.

04:56.720 --> 05:00.720
But maybe it'll pick up when Sargon starts talking.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.720
Let's take a listen.

05:02.720 --> 05:07.220
But I will note here that Sargon presents his whole video sarcastically.

05:07.220 --> 05:13.720
Which is quite helpful for us, really, as it gives us an insight into what he thinks feminists think.

05:14.220 --> 05:17.720
If you're a feminist like me, you're probably aware that we live in a patriarchy.

05:17.720 --> 05:22.720
Now, for those who don't know, a patriarchy is a highly oppressive social system

05:22.720 --> 05:24.720
that benefits men at the expense of women.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.720
And this social system also oppresses men as well, by giving more money to women's healthcare.

05:29.720 --> 05:33.720
For example, women in London live up to 12 years longer than men.

05:33.720 --> 05:39.720
And that might sound like a good thing, but remember that's 12 more years of slavery that women have to endure.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.720
They are simply not allowed to die.

05:42.720 --> 05:48.720
It turns out that the patriarchy will spend almost 2 million more pounds on women's healthcare than men's

05:48.720 --> 05:51.720
to ensure their suffering lasts well into their 80s.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.720
Of course, professional MRAs like Alan White, professor of men's health at Leeds University

05:56.720 --> 06:01.720
and lead author of the recent EU Report on Men's Health, told the bureau that there was a real lack of initiatives

06:01.720 --> 06:03.720
directed at the male population.

06:03.720 --> 06:08.720
Presumably because men's lives are so awesome, they simply don't need these initiatives.

06:08.720 --> 06:14.720
And as agreed at the last International Patriarchy meeting, that money would be better spent oppressing women.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.720
Ha ha ha.

06:17.720 --> 06:24.720
Now, I knew that Sargon put foot wrong here when he cited a university professor, but we'll come back to that in a moment.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.720
Let's take a look at his point.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.720
And it's easy enough to understand.

06:28.720 --> 06:35.720
Some areas of London spend more on health initiatives aimed at women than health initiatives aimed at men.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.720
The question here is, why is Sargon mentioning this?

06:39.720 --> 06:43.720
What does he think this challenges or contradicts?

06:43.720 --> 06:48.720
Well, he leads into the point by talking about patriarchy as defined by feminist theory,

06:48.720 --> 06:52.720
so we'll assume that he thinks this challenges that idea.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.720
And this is something you tend to see from a lot of anti-feminists.

06:56.720 --> 07:03.720
When talking about gender equality, many male anti-feminists in particular tend to focus on topics

07:03.720 --> 07:05.720
where men seem to be disadvantaged.

07:05.720 --> 07:11.720
For example, in custody, education, or in particular here, healthcare.

07:11.720 --> 07:18.720
Their idea of a patriarchal society is one which favors men absolutely in every circumstance,

07:18.720 --> 07:23.720
so to challenge that idea, they start citing exceptions to the rule.

07:23.720 --> 07:30.720
And it would be a perfect argumentative strategy if that definition of patriarchy was the same one that feminists use.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.720
But it's not.

07:32.720 --> 07:37.720
Mainstream feminist thought sees patriarchy as oppressive to both men and women,

07:37.720 --> 07:44.720
which is something you'd think Sargon would understand since he said it, albeit sarcastically.

07:44.720 --> 07:49.720
Addressing men's involvement in gender equality by only stressing men's disadvantages

07:49.720 --> 07:53.720
leads to very simplistic and misleading assumptions.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.720
And that's not me talking there.

07:55.720 --> 08:03.720
That's Professor Alan White, who in a study called The Role of Men in Gender Equalities says,

08:03.720 --> 08:07.720
Involving men in gender mainstreaming and gender equality strategies

08:07.720 --> 08:12.720
bears the risk that gender is framed within certain terms in traditional sex role theory,

08:12.720 --> 08:16.720
mainly reflecting topics where men seem to be disadvantaged,

08:16.720 --> 08:19.720
for example custody, education, or health,

08:19.720 --> 08:22.720
opening up anti-feminist discussion.

08:22.720 --> 08:26.720
Addressing men's involvement in gender equality by only stressing men's disadvantages

08:26.720 --> 08:29.720
will lead to very simplistic and misleading assumptions.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.720
Therefore, one important preconception guiding the study

08:32.720 --> 08:39.720
is to link pro-feminist, progressive, and critical men's policies and studies to gender equality policy,

08:39.720 --> 08:45.720
while rejecting a male discrimination perspective pursued, for example, by men's rights groups

08:45.720 --> 08:48.720
and those theories linked to this approach.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.720
So, Sargon, two helpful hints from me to you.

08:52.720 --> 08:59.720
Firstly, when you're doing your anti-feminist bit, do not cite university professors,

08:59.720 --> 09:06.720
especially ones who specialize in gender studies because they are nearly always pro-feminist.

09:06.720 --> 09:11.720
Secondly, in particular, do not cite university professors who have published material

09:11.720 --> 09:18.720
that gives your exact anti-feminist argumentative strategy a swift kick in the bollocks.

09:18.720 --> 09:25.720
And before we move on, let's just briefly take a look at this Health Initiatives report that Sargon is quoting from.

09:25.720 --> 09:32.720
He presents it as though the reason certain areas of London have a large disparity in life expectancy between the sexes

09:32.720 --> 09:37.720
is solely down to the amount of money spent on health initiatives.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.720
But this is actually contradicted by the report.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.720
When Sargon quotes,

09:42.720 --> 09:45.720
Women in London live up to twelve years longer than men.

09:45.720 --> 09:50.720
He's talking about an area of London called cathedrals in Southwark,

09:50.720 --> 09:54.720
which is the ward which has the largest disparity, which is twelve years.

09:54.720 --> 10:03.720
However, as the report points out, Southwark spends nearly five million pounds more on men's health initiatives than women's.

10:03.720 --> 10:12.720
They have the largest disparity in life expectancy, despite spending nearly three times as much on men's health than on women's health.

10:12.720 --> 10:19.720
Now, what that says to me is that the health initiative funding is reactive, not the direct cause.

10:19.720 --> 10:25.720
They're spending more on men in that area because men have worse health in that area.

10:25.720 --> 10:32.720
And the report does go into some reasons that men have lower life expectancies in the more deprived areas of London.

10:32.720 --> 10:40.720
The economic climate, depression, suicide, a low level of council funding for health in general,

10:40.720 --> 10:46.720
social stigma against men showing vulnerability, and asking for help.

10:46.720 --> 10:55.720
And that last point is a perfect illustration of the feminist understanding of how patriarchy is harmful to both men and women.

10:55.720 --> 11:01.720
And this point comes up again when Sargon brings up the disparities in the homeless rate and the suicide rate.

11:02.720 --> 11:07.720
Just because three out of four homeless people and suicide victims are men, that doesn't mean we need to talk about this.

11:07.720 --> 11:14.720
I mean, have you considered that one in four homeless people and one in four suicide victims are important?

11:14.720 --> 11:20.720
No, I didn't think you did, did you, Mr. Entitled? What a misogynist you are.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.720
So let's take a brief look at the sources Sargon took these headlines from.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.720
The homelessness headline comes from an opinion piece in the Telegraph,

11:29.720 --> 11:34.720
complaining about a Press Association article published in The Guardian,

11:34.720 --> 11:41.720
which itself was about a homelessness audit carried out by the charity HomelessLink.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.720
Peel that onion.

11:43.720 --> 11:49.720
Now the PA article chose to focus on the audit's findings that homeless women are more likely than homeless men

11:50.720 --> 11:55.720
to use drugs like heroin and cocaine, and more likely to suffer from mental health issues.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.720
Which, according to the Telegraph opinion piece author Glenn Poole,

11:58.720 --> 12:04.720
was the pro-feminist guardian being lazy, biased, and sexist against men.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.720
Now whatever we think of that, in the course of writing his piece,

12:08.720 --> 12:13.720
Glenn Poole contacted HomelessLink and got a response offering one explanation

12:13.720 --> 12:17.720
for why the majority of homeless people who don't receive support are male.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.720
And the HomelessLink spokesperson said,

12:20.720 --> 12:25.720
Homeless men are more likely than women to say they don't need support.

12:25.720 --> 12:29.720
Now the suicide headline is taken from a Guardian article,

12:29.720 --> 12:34.720
and that's the same Guardian who were dishonest, pro-feminist shills about 15 seconds ago,

12:34.720 --> 12:38.720
but here are being presented as a legitimate news source.

12:38.720 --> 12:44.720
The Guardian article is about the disparity in the suicide rate between sexes in government statistics,

12:44.720 --> 12:49.720
and it also talks about the launch of an investigation into the causes of suicide

12:49.720 --> 12:53.720
by the University of Bristol and the charity Samaritans.

12:53.720 --> 12:58.720
And they quote the head of policy and research at Samaritans on the reasons they believe

12:58.720 --> 13:01.720
men tend to be higher risk of suicide than women.

13:01.720 --> 13:05.720
In particular here, talking about working class men.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.720
They will grow up expecting by the time they reach mid-life,

13:08.720 --> 13:12.720
they'll have a wife who will look after them and a job for life in a male industry.

13:12.720 --> 13:17.720
In reality, they may find that they reach middle age in a very different position.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.720
Society has this masculine ideal that people are expecting to live up to.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.720
Lots of that has to do with being a breadwinner.

13:24.720 --> 13:29.720
When men don't live up to that, it can be quite devastating for them.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.720
And the Guardian article goes on to say,

13:31.720 --> 13:36.720
Additional factors were the perception that it was more acceptable for men to turn to drink

13:36.720 --> 13:39.720
or other risky behaviour to cope with difficulty,

13:40.720 --> 13:45.720
and men being often reticent about talking about their feelings.

13:45.720 --> 13:51.720
Sargon, the issues you're pointing out that you think contradict feminist arguments

13:51.720 --> 13:54.720
are themselves feminist issues.

13:54.720 --> 13:59.720
Feminists don't deny the fact that men are more likely to commit suicide or be homeless.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.720
You know, they're not delusional.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.720
They believe that one of the factors contributing to those disparities

14:05.720 --> 14:09.720
is a difference in societal expectations of the genders.

14:09.720 --> 14:15.720
In particular here, it's seen as less acceptable or appropriate for men to seek help when they need it.

14:15.720 --> 14:22.720
This fixed notion of gender roles is one of the things that feminists generally want to see changed.

14:22.720 --> 14:27.720
So then, let's somewhat reluctantly move on to autism.

14:27.720 --> 14:31.720
Because the problem is that we really don't understand autism in girls.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.720
And that's a problem.

14:33.720 --> 14:38.720
For example, when a large new study finds significant deviations in brain structure and behaviour

14:38.720 --> 14:40.720
between boys and girls with autism,

14:40.720 --> 14:45.720
you can tell that they are in fact total misogynist pricks

14:45.720 --> 14:50.720
who are deeply anti-feminist and, of course, by definition, anti-woman.

14:50.720 --> 14:56.720
Dr Vinod Menon, a professor of misogyny and oppression at the Stanford School of Medicine

14:56.720 --> 14:59.720
and one of the study's authors, told the Huffington Post that

14:59.720 --> 15:02.720
girls with autism display autism symptoms differently

15:02.720 --> 15:08.720
and this may lead them to be underdiagnosed or may make it harder for them to get the most appropriate treatment.

15:08.720 --> 15:14.720
As if his single study overturns 30 years of feminist scientific research

15:14.720 --> 15:21.720
establishing that there are exactly zero differences between men and women on both a biological and social level.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.720
In this study, while the boys and girls had similar IQ scores

15:24.720 --> 15:28.720
as well as comparable social behaviours and communication skills,

15:28.720 --> 15:33.720
the boys showed significantly more repetitive and restrictive behaviours than the girls did.

15:33.720 --> 15:40.720
Because traditional science, or surrence, is a patriarchal male social construct

15:40.720 --> 15:47.720
specifically designed to exclude women and ensure that men always score better in anything that they do.

15:47.720 --> 15:52.720
And it's this very same surrence that goes on to show that the analysis of the brain scans

15:52.720 --> 15:57.720
reveals that autistic boys have different brain patterns in regions associated with motor function

15:57.720 --> 16:03.720
and the planning of motor activities. What this is, is a patriarchal conspiracy.

16:03.720 --> 16:09.720
So at this point in the video, I started wondering who Sargon is actually arguing against.

16:09.720 --> 16:17.720
He's reading out a neutral voiced news report about a scientific study from the science section of the Huffington Post

16:17.720 --> 16:22.720
and just inserting sarcastic jabs at feminism seemingly at random.

16:22.720 --> 16:28.720
And just personally, as a new viewer of Sargon's, I had no idea what he was talking about here.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.720
There's no actual mention of feminism in the article

16:32.720 --> 16:37.720
and Sargon doesn't mention anyone who actually agrees with what he's sarcastically saying.

16:37.720 --> 16:42.720
Maybe it's just my ignorance, but I have never seen a feminist ever argue

16:42.720 --> 16:47.720
that males and females with autism have identical biologies and brain patterns.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.720
You know, that school of feminist thought must have passed me by.

16:52.720 --> 16:59.720
I don't think I've ever even seen a feminist argue that there are zero social differences between the sexes.

16:59.720 --> 17:06.720
I thought feminism existed because of these social differences in an attempt to redress the imbalance.

17:06.720 --> 17:13.720
You know, who is the person who actually said the things that Sargon is sarcastically arguing against?

17:13.720 --> 17:15.720
Was it this person?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.720
Or how about this person?

17:18.720 --> 17:23.720
Now, I don't really know who this person is. It's Steve Shives.

17:23.720 --> 17:29.720
I only really include him here because Sargon took a pop at him earlier in the video.

17:29.720 --> 17:35.720
So I went and watched Steve Shives' video and he doesn't say anything about autism either.

17:35.720 --> 17:41.720
However, reading the comments on Sargon's video made me realize what he was doing.

17:41.720 --> 17:47.720
Having no actual person to argue against, he's simply inviting his audience to invent one.

17:47.720 --> 17:54.720
Imagine a feminist scientist who's so stupid and irrational in their crusade for gender equality

17:54.720 --> 17:59.720
that they want more women to have autism just to be equal with men.

17:59.720 --> 18:04.720
Imagine how stupid that person is who I just invented.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.720
Or have I spoken too soon?

18:07.720 --> 18:11.720
I'm going to level with you and give you the absolute truth of the matter.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.720
Autism is a feminist issue.

18:14.720 --> 18:19.720
One out of every 68 children today in the United States receives a diagnosis of autism.

18:19.720 --> 18:23.720
And of course, one out of 42 of them is male.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.720
And 100% of them have a tumblr account.

18:34.720 --> 18:40.720
And many people think that autism is the fastest growing developmental disability in the US.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.720
And there's no cure for autism.

18:43.720 --> 18:50.720
So this piece that Sargon's quoting from is by Esther Nelson from the website Feminism and Religion.

18:50.720 --> 18:56.720
So is this person the real, irrational feminist scientist that Sargon appears to be arguing with?

18:56.720 --> 18:59.720
Well, let's take a look at her article.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.720
The first thing to note here is that it's speculative.

19:03.720 --> 19:10.720
Note the question mark in the title indicating it's intended as a question and not, as Sargon said,

19:10.720 --> 19:12.720
a statement of absolute truth.

19:12.720 --> 19:19.720
Now, nowhere in this article does Nelson talk about how autism manifests differently in boys and girls.

19:19.720 --> 19:26.720
Nor does she talk about the statistical disparity between the sexes except to mention it as a statement of fact.

19:26.720 --> 19:33.720
The rest of the article is about behaviors in possibly undiagnosed, high-functioning autistic adult males

19:33.720 --> 19:37.720
and patriarchal interpretations of those behaviors.

19:37.720 --> 19:42.720
I.e. she's coming at this from a totally different angle than Sargon.

19:42.720 --> 19:47.720
She's certainly not arguing for increased diagnosis of autism in women.

19:47.720 --> 19:53.720
So we can cross her off the list of possible suspects for whoever Sargon is arguing with.

19:53.720 --> 19:58.720
So, this raises a question. Why is her article in Sargon's video?

19:58.720 --> 20:03.720
It doesn't seem particularly relevant beyond being generally about autism.

20:03.720 --> 20:10.720
A cynic would probably point out that if you Google feminist and autism, it's, you know, one of the first links that comes up,

20:10.720 --> 20:15.720
so it being in there is probably more to do with convenience than relevance.

20:15.720 --> 20:20.720
However, this is where Sargon pulls his list of common signifiers of autism from.

20:20.720 --> 20:25.720
Let's watch him run down the list. And just a note of warning before he begins here,

20:25.720 --> 20:29.720
you might want to hold your sides lest they split.

20:29.720 --> 20:35.720
There are eight major signs of autism that you can identify in your friends, your family, your colleagues, your co-workers,

20:35.720 --> 20:41.720
perhaps even your business or your organization, or even a social movement you happen to identify with.

20:41.720 --> 20:44.720
The first is an extreme sensitivity to criticism.

20:45.720 --> 20:49.720
If you feel that a different opinion makes you want to block that person,

20:49.720 --> 20:57.720
and everyone who has ever spoken to that person, possibly via use of a blockbot on social media, you might have autism.

20:57.720 --> 21:02.720
The second one is that you have rigid thinking. You think that things are either right or they are wrong,

21:02.720 --> 21:09.720
and there is no gray area between them. For example, you might say that you're either a feminist or you're a sexist.

21:09.720 --> 21:13.720
If you reduce everything to these binary criteria, you might have autism.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.720
Number three is that you are easily distressed when things aren't right.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.720
Meltdowns, loss of control often happen.

21:20.720 --> 21:28.720
For example, if you need safe spaces to be able to discuss anything that might slightly upset you, you might have autism.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.720
In fact, I think I'll spare you the pain and we'll just fast forward the rest of them,

21:32.720 --> 21:35.720
because he does this for a very long time and it's very tedious.

21:35.720 --> 21:42.720
So there we go, we have finally reached the point of the video calling feminists autistic.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.720
So what was all that other stuff that came before it?

21:45.720 --> 21:50.720
You know, all the misrepresented or misunderstood news stories and studies.

21:50.720 --> 21:57.720
None of that has anything to do with this, but it does serve a purpose for Sargon, and it's this.

21:57.720 --> 22:02.720
It's to trick his audience into thinking they're not watching this.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.720
So she's basically fucking insane, you crazy fucking mug.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.720
This bitch is just dumb, period. Like, they are actually fucking retarded.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.720
Because they are watching that.

22:12.720 --> 22:17.720
And to close my video here, I'm just gonna briefly look at this list myself.

22:17.720 --> 22:24.720
But before I do, please understand I would never consciously use autism as an insult to describe people who disagree with me.

22:24.720 --> 22:30.720
I think it's crass and childish and insulting to people who actually have autism.

22:30.720 --> 22:39.720
What I'm about to do is show how easily Sargon's stretched interpretations of these behavioral signifiers can be turned back on him.

22:39.720 --> 22:45.720
I'm not calling him autistic. Offensive and lazy, maybe, but not autistic.

22:45.720 --> 22:48.720
Extreme sensitivity to criticism.

22:48.720 --> 22:56.720
For example, if you're so afraid of criticism that you refuse to listen to arguments that criticize your beliefs because they're too long,

22:56.720 --> 22:59.720
you might be Sargon of Akkad.

22:59.720 --> 23:04.720
Endless talking about or bulldogging a subject, usually in a monotone.

23:04.720 --> 23:13.720
For example, if you find yourself endlessly talking in a monotone about how stupid feminists are, you might be Sargon of Akkad.

23:13.720 --> 23:18.720
Often highly intelligent, but for... actually, this one doesn't count.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.720
Lack of empathy.

23:20.720 --> 23:28.720
For example, if you think it's okay to use a developmental disorder that real people actually struggle with as an insult for people you don't like,

23:28.720 --> 23:36.720
if you think it's okay to use a photograph of an unrelated person as a clickbait thumbnail on a video calling people autistic,

23:36.720 --> 23:42.720
if you defended Elliot Rodger, and yes, Sargon defended Elliot Rodger...

23:42.720 --> 23:48.720
And no, it's not all men who act this way. But you know what? It's way too f***ing many.

23:48.720 --> 23:57.720
Which is ironic considering that before your stupid social justice feminine bullshit, it didn't happen on this scale.

23:57.720 --> 24:02.720
It's crazy! This is a disease of the modern age.

24:02.720 --> 24:14.720
You are responsible for perpetuating it by disenfranchising these poor f***ing guys who don't have any options left.

24:14.720 --> 24:25.720
When someone takes the option of absolutes insanely last resort, you have to wonder what kind of system is producing them.

24:25.720 --> 24:31.720
And I tell you what, Lacey, it is a f***ing feminist system that's doing this!

24:31.720 --> 24:37.720
If you defended Elliot Rodger... well, you get the point.

24:37.720 --> 24:41.720
Now I know there's gonna be a few people who comment on this video saying,

24:41.720 --> 24:49.720
It was a joke. Sargon's just joking. It's a joke video. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's all a joke.

24:49.720 --> 24:53.720
My response to that is, no it's not.
