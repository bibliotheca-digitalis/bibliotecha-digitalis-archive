00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,180
This is a video about YouTuber BlackPigeonSpeaks, and in particular, his video entitled

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,680
Why Women Destroy Nations Slash Civilizations and Other Uncomfortable Truths.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,840
No prizes for guessing what this one's about.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,640
If women's sexual preferences are liberated and go unchecked, they destroy civilizations.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,080
If women are allowed to choose, harems form.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,080
If women are allowed a voice in matters that pertain to the safety of a nation,

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,720
then that nation will die, inevitably.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,560
And quite helpfully, BlackPigeon kicks off his video by laying out a list of his arguments.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,960
As this is a complicated subject, let me state briefly what I'm talking about in this video

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,360
so you can follow along more closely.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,040
Women do not, on an instinctual level, care very much about her tribe, nation, or civilization.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,280
It's in their nature not to.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,080
Women are biological creatures, like all others,

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,320
and they seek to maximize their chances of having viable offspring.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,280
This half-century-long experiment of women's liberation and political enfranchisement

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,240
has ended in disaster for the West.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
And the damage done to the West may be irreparable,

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,600
and the only solution would be a return to a more patriarchal society,

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,160
and this seems highly unlikely.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,640
So, right off the bat there, we've got some extraordinary claims,

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,480
and as we know, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,200
So we're going to go through BlackPigeon's video

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,720
and take a look at the evidence behind these arguments.

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,480
And as always, I'd encourage you to also watch BlackPigeon's video

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,160
so you can be sure that I'm not misrepresenting his arguments.

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,240
Now then, first up, we're going to look at his claim that women are inherently disloyal,

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,840
and this is explained in the section of his video entitled,

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
Betrayal.

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,160
And let's get this out in the open.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,600
Women are not very good at being loyal to the tribe.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,000
They never have been, they never will be.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,400
The reason is it's not in their nature to do so.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,240
Women throughout history have shown time and time again

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,560
they're quick to seek the favors of men they feel are stronger and more dominant,

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
whether they're part of their in-group or not.

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,120
Recent examples of this besides Japanese or Vietnamese war brides

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,920
come from Europe and are illustrated by the countless numbers of

38
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,560
Belgian, French, Dutch, what have you,

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
women that took up relations with occupying German military personnel.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
And this was only a short time ago,

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,040
but when Nazis were defeated and social stability was restored,

42
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,840
they were punished for their betrayal and transgressions against their people.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,440
So for the argument that women are not loyal to their society or culture,

44
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,200
Black Pigeon offers the evidence that some women sleep with, marry,

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,080
or otherwise aid enemies of their country after it's been defeated in war.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
And this is because women are, quote,

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,760
quick to seek the favors of men who are stronger or more dominant.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,680
And there's a few problems with this, but let's start at the beginning.

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,160
Now the first news story that Black Pigeon uses is entitled,

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,640
The Japanese Women Who Married the Enemy.

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,320
And it's about Japanese women who met and married American soldiers

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,360
after the surrender of Japan in the Second World War.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,320
And it quotes a Japanese woman who offers her reasons for doing so.

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,200
Everything was crumbled as a result of the US bombing.

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,720
You couldn't find streets or stores. It was a nightmare.

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
We were struggling for food and lodging.

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
I didn't know very much about Bill, his background or family,

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
but I took a chance when he asked me to marry him.

59
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,440
I couldn't live there. I had to get out to survive.

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,240
Now nowhere does she say that she was enamored by how strong or dominant Bill was.

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,960
Her choice was to marry Bill, or possibly starve to death.

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,920
You know, Tokyo was pretty much totally destroyed at the end of the Second World War,

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,680
and she married an American soldier to, you know, not die.

64
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,400
And this point is echoed in the Daily Mail article that Black Pigeon cites

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,120
talking about French women who worked as prostitutes for occupying German soldiers.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,600
Yet not all of the women had been prostitutes before the war.

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,080
Some had been respectable housewives and mothers

68
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,200
and claimed they were prostituting themselves only to eat.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,680
Now, also, Black Pigeon, it takes two to tango, if you know what I mean.

70
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,720
For every woman who sleeps with or marries an enemy,

71
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,360
does that not also require a man to sleep with or marry an enemy?

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,320
Why are you only taking women to task for this?

73
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,560
You know, by the same logic, that means women are disloyal if they shack up with an enemy.

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,600
Aren't men just as disloyal for doing the same?

75
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
Also, a lot of these women didn't have a choice.

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,120
They were just trying to survive in hard times.

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,480
But the men had a choice.

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
You know, American men didn't have to marry Japanese women.

79
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,160
They just did it because they wanted to.

80
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,520
And of course, some men go further than just sleeping with or marrying the enemy.

81
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
Sometimes, they fight for them.

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,120
One of the last German units to see action in World War II

83
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
was the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division,

84
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
which participated in the defense of central Berlin.

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
And that was comprised of French volunteers.

86
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,320
And since Black Pigeon mentioned punishment after the fact,

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
the leader of the French volunteers during the defense of Berlin

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,160
was sentenced to 20 years hard labor.

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,960
Others were imprisoned, and some were just shot upon being captured by the French.

90
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,680
And of course, some Japanese people fought for America in the Second World War.

91
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,400
The 442nd Infantry Regiment of the United States Army

92
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,800
was made up almost entirely of soldiers of Japanese ancestry,

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,960
and they're one of the most decorated units in American military history.

94
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,280
So why don't the actions of these men prove that it's not in the nature of men

95
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,600
to be loyal to their, quote, tribe?

96
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,240
Black Pigeon is really holding men and women to different standards here.

97
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,280
And speaking of that...

98
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,680
Now, not only are women not punished for inviting

99
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
alien and unassimilable armies of men into the West,

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,120
they then vote for parties that force the entire society

101
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,880
to have its national wealth redistributed to this army of aggressive and hostile men.

102
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,240
Now first off, just because you have a photograph of some women holding a refugee's welcome sign

103
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,600
doesn't mean that that sentiment is unique to women.

104
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,920
Secondly, just a minor pet peeve of mine,

105
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,800
but I hate that when people talk about immigrants disparagingly, they only ever say men.

106
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
You know, look at this clip.

107
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,000
There's men, there's women, there's children, there's all sorts of people.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,240
And the United Nations data on Syrian refugees puts the gender split at around 50-50.

109
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
And of course, a large percentage of those are children.

110
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,960
It's hardly an army.

111
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,840
Black Pigeon's just only saying men because he thinks men are scarier, I guess.

112
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,480
And I'm specifically talking about Syria here,

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,960
because the image that Black Pigeon used was of free women welcoming Syrian refugees to Munich.

114
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
And here's a video of the event, and you can see the sign in the background there.

115
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:20,800
And look at this evil invading army of, like, regular families and children and elderly women.

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,680
It's hardly the Nazis coming over the hill.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Also, how do these women at all relate to the earlier point

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,840
about women seeking the favour of stronger and more dominant men?

119
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,160
You know, a refugee fleeing a failed state doesn't exactly scream dominant alpha male at me.

120
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,400
I guess I just don't really see the comparison between these women and prostitutes in occupied France.

121
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,040
The entire basis of Western society was the male agreement to keep only one woman in public,

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,720
so that every male has near equal chance at reproduction.

123
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,520
It's for this reason that organized and advanced civilizations have always needed to agree

124
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,000
on the equitable distribution of women,

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,160
so as to incentivize its men to produce and have a stake in the society's health and security.

126
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,320
But this, like other cultural arrangements that held the West together for centuries,

127
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,800
is breaking down, and can be observed in something as basic as the fact

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,280
there are no Western countries that are even at replacement levels in their birth rates.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,320
This again can be laid at the feet of loosening of sexual morality and the dating habits of young women.

130
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,360
Now, I couldn't find exactly where Black Pigeon found this particular fertility rate graph,

131
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,480
but I saw the World Bank source down the bottom there,

132
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,160
so I went to the World Bank website and had a look at their data.

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,440
And they've got a neat little graph-making feature,

134
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,680
so I first recreated the graph in Black Pigeon's video using those countries and date ranges.

135
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,000
And as you can see, the graphs is the same.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,040
So the first thing to note here is that the fall of the fertility rate since the 1960s

137
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,920
is not specific to Western countries.

138
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,240
If we add in the worldwide average, we can see that over the specified date range, that's falling too.

139
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,440
And the next thing to note is that the World Bank data only goes back to 1960,

140
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,760
which is just far enough to catch the post-World War II baby boom.

141
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,440
Now, I'm not gonna go into that much right now, but for those who don't know,

142
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,720
people tended to postpone starting families during World War II, if possible, you know?

143
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,000
The economy's terrible, the Nazis are invading, all the men are off fighting, it's a bad time to have kids.

144
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,040
But once the war's over, you know, everyone gets back to the baby-making.

145
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,920
Then once everyone who wants kids has had kids, there's generally a drop in the fertility rate

146
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,200
because the new generation that was born isn't old enough to have their own kids for a couple of decades.

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
And this is why you see the birth rate stabilize around 1980.

148
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,160
If we cut the boom out and only look at the data from 1980 onwards,

149
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,320
we see that the birth rates in those Western countries have actually been trending very slightly upwards.

150
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,480
And they're much closer today to the worldwide average, which is still falling.

151
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,080
Another point here is that by selecting certain countries and certain date ranges,

152
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,880
you can basically make whatever point you like.

153
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,040
And let's look at a few countries where the majority of people are Muslims and,

154
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
oh God, would you look at that? The birth rates are plummeting off a cliff.

155
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,160
Islam must be dying out pretty soon. There'll be no Muslims left at all.

156
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,360
Also, one thing to understand is that female psychology has always been about adaptation.

157
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,160
In our tribal past, if women of conquered tribes didn't submit to their new masters,

158
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,560
they faced death along with their husbands, brothers, sons, fathers.

159
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,360
Even today, many women seek out aggressive men, whether consciously or not,

160
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,280
as it seems that this psychology has been ground into women after countless years of our species' evolution.

161
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:03,200
That means criminals, gangsters, and mass murderers are always going to be more attractive to women than hard-working, honest men.

162
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
They always have been, they always will be.

163
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,360
Now, I won't deny that a certain number of people are attracted to that sort of notoriety,

164
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:19,200
but I guarantee if you ask the average woman if she'd rather marry an average, honest, hard-working guy,

165
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:27,520
or Charles fucking Manson, she's gonna pick the guy without the swastika tattoo on his forehead.

166
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,880
Black Pigeon is again viewing the actions of a very small minority of women as representative of all women.

167
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,320
Now, I don't have any studies for this on hand, but I did ask for women who I know personally

168
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,600
if they'd rather marry a completely average man or Charles Manson.

169
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
And they all said some variant of the sentence,

170
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
Why the fuck would I ever marry Charles Manson?

171
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,840
And that's anecdotal evidence, sure, but I'm willing to bet it generally holds true for most women.

172
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,920
The culture of the sensitive man, the emotional man, the compassionate man,

173
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,400
is at odds with what women are biologically predisposed to desire.

174
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,040
Young women, if they tell you the truth, are drawn to the scoundrel,

175
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,560
not the impeccable gentleman with the perfectly manicured fingernails.

176
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,960
I'm afraid.

177
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,560
You're trembling.

178
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
I'm not trembling.

179
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,800
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

180
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,120
You're not a scoundrel in your life.

181
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
I happen to like nice men.

182
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
I'm a nice man.

183
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Very nice.

184
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,520
Okay, that's a movie, dude.

185
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,600
You know, come on, don't cite a movie as your basis for claims about women's biological impulses.

186
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,440
But to laughingly take this somewhat seriously for a moment,

187
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,640
I'm gonna bet quite a lot of women's attraction to Han Solo

188
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,480
is mainly because he looks like Harrison Ford in the 80s.

189
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,040
You know, the Emperor is certainly more of a dominant alpha male than Han,

190
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
but I don't see many women pining after him, oddly enough.

191
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,640
However, we do all remember Leia's classic line after she meets Grand Moff Tarkin,

192
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,920
where she says,

193
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,840
So who knows, maybe Black Pigeon is onto something here.

194
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,760
Let's move on.

195
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,960
It's so much a part of women's psyche to want the scoundrel,

196
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
that it's wrapped up in their very DNA.

197
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,080
Just to get this out of the way, because I have a feeling it might show up in the comments,

198
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,360
yes, I am aware that the vast majority of women, when raped, reach sexual clim-

199
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,760
Whoa, uh, hang on, I'm not touching this bit, let's move further on.

200
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,560
Once women were given equal say in the sphere of politics,

201
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,640
it was only a matter of time until our civilization was swept up by the event horizon of its own collapse.

202
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,760
All kinds of studies have been done on this subject,

203
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,240
as this one from Columbia University, and they all, without exception,

204
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,480
note that as women become more quote-unquote emancipated,

205
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,120
the decline of the family is further accelerated.

206
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,120
And as the family disintegrates and women move politically further and further to the left in their voting,

207
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
many then begin to use the government as a surrogate husband and provider.

208
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,920
So here, Black Pigeon is arguing that women are moving further and further to the left in their voting.

209
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,400
But let's take a look at his sources here.

210
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,760
First, the study, uh, entitled, Why Have Women Become Left-Wing?

211
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,360
which is looking at the reasons that more women than men in the United States vote for the Democrats.

212
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,200
And in particular, it's looking at why the gender gap has been widening over the last few decades.

213
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,920
Now, if you just read the headline, you might get the sense that men occupy some sort of fixed political position,

214
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,760
and the gender gap is only caused by women moving to the left.

215
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,840
But if you read the study, it also mentions the inverse of that,

216
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,400
which is men moving further to the right to support the Republicans.

217
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,960
And this is something that Black Pigeon's next source goes into in more detail.

218
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,720
Uh, this headline, Why Do Women Vote Differently Than Men? is from Slate.com.

219
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,560
And this is some excellent tactical cropping from Black Pigeon here,

220
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,520
because if we scroll down just an inch, we can read the subheader.

221
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,720
Despite stereotypes, men are actually more fickle at the voting booth.

222
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
And this article argues that it's men moving to the right,

223
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,480
more so than women moving to the left, that is responsible for the gender gap.

224
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
And I quote,

225
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,000
So did women move away from Reagan and his party in disgust?

226
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,440
No. Rather, women's emerging belief in their own political entitlement permitted them to stay right where they were.

227
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,160
Reagan struck a chord with men, so men moved in a more Republican direction while women stayed put.

228
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,200
Kaufmann of the University of Maryland has looked at long-term election study data from 1952 to 2004

229
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,920
and observed that men's support for the Democratic Party declined from the mid-70s

230
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,640
through the eight years of Reagan's presidency,

231
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,120
and has remained at that lower level, with small fluctuations ever since.

232
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,960
In contrast, she writes,

233
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,760
And this isn't me going out and looking for some source to contradict Black Pigeon's claims here.

234
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,400
This article is in his video.

235
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,560
Well, the headline is, anyway.

236
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,400
And let's look at the next headline.

237
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,560
Women Today Have a New Husband.

238
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,800
And this is from the website theprimalmale.com.

239
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,760
Uh, not a publication I'd heard of.

240
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,080
And what does this article have to say about women and the government?

241
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,560
Yikes.

242
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,240
And this website has some other interesting articles, like, uh,

243
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,320
Friendship with Women is Unnatural,

244
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,200
Modern Women's Contempt for Men,

245
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,560
uh,

246
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,000
what it feels like to be a nihilist, in which the author states,

247
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,240
Jeez.

248
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
It sounds like someone doesn't have any loyalty for his tribe.

249
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,280
Now then, apologies for the length of this next clip,

250
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,200
but it does represent the main source behind Black Pigeon's arguments,

251
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
so we're gonna have to watch all of it, I'm afraid.

252
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,080
In one of the most comprehensive studies of civilizational decline,

253
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,000
J.D. Unwin postulates in his book, Sex and Culture,

254
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
written in 1934,

255
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,440
Unwin, a British social anthropologist at Oxford and Cambridge universities,

256
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,360
studied 86 different cultures through 5,000 years of history,

257
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,480
and found a positive correlation between the cultural achievement of a people,

258
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,200
and the sexual restraint they observed.

259
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,560
Unwin's impetus for the project was to test the Freudian theory

260
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,800
that civilizational progress was the product of repressed sexuality.

261
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,280
He found that discipline in sexual matters appropriated social energy

262
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,800
to more civilizational ends.

263
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,240
It's very complicated, but for Unwin, the fabric of society was primarily sexual,

264
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,240
and heterosexual monogamy was the optimal arrangement for the planning,

265
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,120
building, protecting, and nurturing of the family.

266
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,560
If enough heterosexual partners made a monogamous commitment,

267
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,840
civilizational energy was directed toward promoting

268
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,560
the finest societal foundation possible.

269
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,960
Without exception, each civilization he studied allowed its success

270
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,880
to alter its moral code.

271
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,640
According to Unwin, after a nation becomes increasingly liberal

272
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,960
with regards to its sexual morality,

273
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,760
it loses its cohesion, its impetus, and its purpose.

274
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,560
From a chaste moral code, societies gain what he called expansive energy,

275
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,880
and this energy allowed these cultures to expand into other weaker cultures.

276
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,720
Okay, so let's talk about J.D. Unwin.

277
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,960
Now, when someone first recommended I make a video about Black Pigeon,

278
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,760
this Why Women Destroy Civilizations video was the first one I clicked on.

279
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
And before I watched it, I thought,

280
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,120
oh, well, this will be easy.

281
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,800
He'll obviously at some point list some example civilizations

282
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,720
that have been destroyed by women,

283
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
and then I can just counter those.

284
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,800
You know, for example, I imagined at some point Black Pigeon would say something like,

285
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,280
women's rights destroyed the Roman Empire,

286
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,440
and then I could just list off a bunch of reasons

287
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,000
that the Roman Empire actually collapsed

288
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,880
and make him seem foolish for oversimplifying it and pinning everything just on women.

289
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
So that was my plan going into this.

290
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,840
However, as you may have noticed by now,

291
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,320
Black Pigeon has not directly mentioned even one actual civilization

292
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,560
that's collapsed because of women's rights.

293
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,760
And nor does he ever, actually, in the entire video.

294
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,640
The only examples he gives are indirect.

295
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
He says that this J.D. Unwin guy found a bunch of civilizations

296
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,560
that were destroyed by women's rights.

297
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,360
So I thought, okay, new plan.

298
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
To get a concrete example here,

299
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,920
what I'm gonna have to do is go and read Sex and Culture by J.D. Unwin,

300
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,120
get to the bit where he says women's rights destroyed the Roman Empire or something like that,

301
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,000
and then I can counter that and, by proxy, prove Black Pigeon wrong.

302
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,080
So I went and read Sex and Culture by J.D. Unwin,

303
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,400
and as I read it, I realized I'd made two very amateur mistakes,

304
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
but we'll get back to those in a little while.

305
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
First, let's talk about Unwin's book.

306
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,320
Now, if you search online for J.D. Unwin,

307
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
you mainly only find him and his book mentioned in the same terms

308
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,480
that Black Pigeon is presenting it here.

309
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,320
Unwin seems to be quite popular in alt-right circles,

310
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,400
as someone who predicted that feminism will destroy the West.

311
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,120
But is that what his book actually says?

312
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
Well, let's take a look.

313
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,280
So, by and large, Black Pigeon does, initially,

314
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,880
give a fair representation of Unwin's general argument.

315
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
Unwin looked at a bunch of different cultures and civilizations

316
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,400
and sorted them into a hierarchy.

317
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,320
The exact specifics of which aren't terribly relevant for us right now,

318
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,080
but generally, the top of the scale represents more, quote,

319
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,640
advanced and civilized societies,

320
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,960
and the bottom of the scale, the less advanced and less civilized.

321
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,720
Now, what Unwin found was that societies nearer the top of his scale

322
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,280
tended to have more restrictive sexual norms than the societies lower on the scale.

323
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,120
Unwin also sees everything in terms of energy,

324
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,680
you know, expansive energy for a society to expand its territory,

325
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,600
creative energy to invent new things, and so on.

326
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,400
And he argues that societies further up the scale

327
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,840
have more energy than those lower on the scale.

328
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,240
And beyond just proving the correlation,

329
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,200
Unwin argues that the restricted sexual norms

330
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,560
are the cause of the increased societal energy,

331
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,400
and he thinks that if sexual relations are too easy to attain,

332
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,040
then a society will lose its energy.

333
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,120
I mean, basically, his argument is this.

334
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,320
Did you notice what went wrong in that scene?

335
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,000
Ordinarily, Billy would work hard to make money with his paper route.

336
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,720
Then he'd use the money to buy dinner for Mavis,

337
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,560
thus earning a slim chance to perform the reproductive act.

338
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,640
But in a world where teens can date robots, why should he bother?

339
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
Why should anyone bother?

340
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,040
Let's take a look at Billy's planet a year later.

341
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Where are all the football stars?

342
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,400
And where are the biochemists?

343
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,440
They're trapped.

344
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,880
Trapped in the soft vice-like grip of robot lips.

345
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,480
All civilization was just an effort to impress the opposite sex.

346
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,400
With robots being a stand-in for easy access to sex there, I guess.

347
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,960
So there you go, you are now up to speed on J.D. Unwin's sex and culture.

348
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,840
So what do we think of his argument?

349
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,000
Well, just personally, I think that,

350
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,560
beyond being too quick to discard examples that go against his hypothesis,

351
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Unwin generally proves the correlation between restricted sexual norms

352
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,680
and the advancement of civilization just fine.

353
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,400
But I'm not sold on it being causative.

354
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,040
In my opinion, for a society to actually be able to enforce sexual norms,

355
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,400
it generally has to have things like a strong government,

356
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,360
a legal system capable of imposing punishments,

357
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,680
usually a state religion to provide some religious justification.

358
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,080
And a society which has these things is typically gonna find itself

359
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,960
near at the top of Unwin's list anyway.

360
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,960
So I'd say restricted sexual norms just tend to go hand in hand

361
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,680
with the advancement of civilization rather than being the direct cause of it.

362
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,960
Now, I tend to agree with Aldous Huxley's view of Unwin.

363
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,000
Who thought sex and culture was a very significant work,

364
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,680
but that Unwin was guilty of oversimplification.

365
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,320
And this quote is taken from Huxley's introduction

366
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,320
to Unwin's posthumously published follow-up to sex and culture,

367
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,920
which we'll get to later.

368
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,720
This oversimplification is twofold.

369
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,160
There is what may be called the extensional oversimplification,

370
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,560
which consists in the omission to consider

371
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,080
all the significant factors existing at a given time.

372
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,560
And there is a temporal oversimplification,

373
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
which is the failure to take into account

374
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,720
the occasional and unpredictable emergence

375
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
into actuality of entirely new entities.

376
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,800
It's a mouthful.

377
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,480
Now, what Huxley's saying there, basically,

378
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
is Unwin misses a lot of shit out.

379
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,840
And he goes on to name a ton of things that represent

380
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,280
an equal or greater effect on a society's success

381
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,880
than the particular restrictiveness of its sexual norms.

382
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,240
You know, agricultural and technological advancement,

383
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,840
religion, nutrition, warfare, scientific discovery, diplomacy, and so on.

384
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,120
For Huxley, focusing too much on one specific societal element,

385
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,720
like Unwin does with sexual norms,

386
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,760
won't give you the full picture of how a society works.

387
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,920
And Huxley also raises another excellent point when he asks,

388
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,080
Do the conditions which make for a display of maximum energy

389
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,640
also and automatically make for a display of the best kind of energy?

390
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,080
Are the most energetic individuals and societies

391
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,760
necessarily the most kindly, forbearing, and peaceable?

392
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,440
And this is a very good question.

393
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,080
I mean, Nazi Germany certainly had a lot of expansive and creative energy.

394
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,760
No one can deny that.

395
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,840
It had so much expansive energy, in fact, that it got itself destroyed.

396
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,560
Now, before we get back to Black Pigeon,

397
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,000
I just want to make one more note about Unwin.

398
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,040
In Sex and Culture, he was approaching the issue strictly as a scientist.

399
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,400
For him, human civilizations are deterministic.

400
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,000
He makes no moral judgments, and aside from a few sentences in his conclusion,

401
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,920
he offers no political guidance.

402
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,760
In his later work, entitled Hyposia, however,

403
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,040
he creates an imaginary country called Hyposia,

404
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,280
which has all the elements which, for him, would allow the society

405
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,680
to be the most energetic and productive for the longest possible time.

406
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,600
So by reading that book, we can get a picture of exactly the sort of society that Unwin would want.

407
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
But we'll get back to that shortly.

408
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,800
For now, let's return to Black Pigeon.

409
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,000
Now, when you compare the modern Western world with the Islamic one,

410
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,280
you see exactly the results that Unwin's theory would predict.

411
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,000
By allowing women to fuck freely...

412
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Whoa! The mask slipped a bit there, dude.

413
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,280
I don't think I can say the word fuck with that level of venom.

414
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,640
By allowing women to fuck freely...

415
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,340
Ugh!

416
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,520
By allowing women to fuck freely,

417
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,880
the West has de facto entered a matriarchy that disincentivizes young men.

418
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,080
Islam, on the other hand, keeps their women chaste,

419
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,280
and their expansive energy, as Unwin's theory predicts,

420
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,000
is manifested in what we're observing today.

421
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,280
The Islamic culture is the one who's expanding into the West.

422
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,760
Okay, so a brief point here.

423
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,160
Syrian refugees are some people fleeing a war zone.

424
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,320
They are not an organized army.

425
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,040
I can think of several instances, from my lifetime even,

426
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,920
when the West has been the invading armed force in a lot of Islamic countries.

427
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,600
I mean, in my lifetime, the United States actually invaded Iraq,

428
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,320
and took over the government.

429
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,840
But let's look at Unwin's hypothetical country of Hyposia,

430
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,760
and see how that would treat immigrants.

431
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,240
Another important part of a society's existence is its contact with other societies.

432
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,440
In a sluggish, uncivilized society, strangers are feared greatly.

433
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Not because there is anything objectively fearsome about them,

434
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,080
but because they are strange, unusual beings who behave and speak in strange, unusual ways.

435
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,440
And this attitude toward strangers is also apparent among the less cultured members

436
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:50,080
of an energetic society, who will not have anything to do with a foreigner if they can help it.

437
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,600
Even in a rationalistic society, strangers are seldom treated in the same way as natives,

438
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,520
and in Hyposia, the duty of maintaining a sympathetic relation with other societies will

439
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,000
be allotted to special men.

440
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:11,840
You see, Unwin likes energy, and diversity of people, of thought, of whatever, for him is more energetic.

441
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,400
He doesn't want culture to stay the same. He wants it to change and adapt to new circumstances.

442
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,760
So enough about J.D. Unwin for now. Let's talk about Sweden.

443
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,560
The total and complete feminization of Sweden and its men

444
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,880
have allowed their women to invite their country's own destruction

445
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,240
through the importation of millions of unassimilatable and aggressive people

446
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,040
from completely alien cultures.

447
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,960
Not only are they borrowing money to fund the colonization of their country,

448
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,560
but they are now even creating gender imbalances

449
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,680
that will have severe and lasting repercussions on their society's future.

450
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,840
So something about that last source there seemed a little off to me.

451
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,640
You know, not only does it appear to have been written by someone called Fuzzy Slippers,

452
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,760
the claim seems a little suspect.

453
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,600
A worse gender imbalance than China? Really?

454
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,120
Well, let's investigate.

455
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,920
So this headline comes from a conservative website called LegalInsurrection.com,

456
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:26,160
and in it, Fuzzy Slippers is giving their interpretation of a January 2016 BBC story entitled

457
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,000
Why Does Sweden Have More Boys Than Girls?

458
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,680
So the first thing to note here is that the data in this news story

459
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,680
specifically looks at 16 and 17-year-olds,

460
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,840
which is, of course, not mentioned by BlackPigeon in his video.

461
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,720
Now then, normally, on average, there are 105 boys born for every 100 girls,

462
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,240
and in Sweden in 2014, there were 108 boys for every 100 girls.

463
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,400
So that's hardly that dramatic of a difference so far.

464
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,120
Now, in China, there are 117 boys to every 100 girls in that age range.

465
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,440
So what's going on here?

466
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,960
In just one year, how has the average number of boys in that age range in Sweden

467
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,400
jumped higher than China?

468
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,840
Or at least, how has it appeared to have jumped higher than China?

469
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,480
Well, if we look at this graph from the BBC article,

470
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,760
we see that the vast majority of asylum applicants are males in that age range.

471
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,680
So, why is that?

472
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,160
Well, according to this news story anyway,

473
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,760
it's to do with a particular right to family reunification that they have in Sweden.

474
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,200
It seems like if you apply for asylum in Sweden before you're 18 and you're successful,

475
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,880
you can then apply for family reunification,

476
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,080
and your family can get in on your residency permit.

477
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,400
Now, that's obviously quite an attractive prospect for a lot of people,

478
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,840
and it does explain why there's such a high number of male applicants in that age range.

479
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,760
I'm saying applicants because that's all they are at this point.

480
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,080
They've applied for asylum.

481
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,160
Now, the large gender imbalance cited by legalinsurrection.com

482
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,360
is from an estimate by Valerie Hudson of Texas A&M University,

483
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,160
and there's something very important to note here.

484
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,880
Her estimate was made under the assumption that

485
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,080
every single asylum applicant would be granted a residency permit,

486
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,080
which, to put it lightly, is not very realistic.

487
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,040
Although, I admit, I'm cheating a bit here by writing this ten months in the future,

488
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,160
where I know that Sweden rejected half of the asylum seekers who applied in 2015.

489
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,760
Hindsight is 2020, as they say.

490
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,440
The second thing to note here is that these 16 and 17-year-olds

491
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,720
were applying so disproportionately for asylum in Sweden

492
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,240
so that they could use the right to reunification to get their families in.

493
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,840
Now, I doubt that Black Pigeon would be too happy about that, to be honest,

494
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,520
but what it does mean is, even if they did all get in,

495
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,640
the gender imbalance stats no longer check out.

496
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,240
Because if a teenager is successful in his asylum application,

497
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,440
and then he invites his mum and his gran and auntie and three sisters over,

498
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,600
you know, the gender imbalance disappears.

499
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,320
Sweden does not have a gender imbalance worse than China.

500
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,400
There are more women than men in Sweden.

501
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,720
For this headline to make any sense at all,

502
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,720
you first have to only be talking about 16 and 17-year-olds,

503
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,240
then you have to assume that every single male applicant for asylum will get in,

504
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,040
and then you have to assume that they will not take advantage of the right to family reunification.

505
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,880
Which seems to be the reason they were applying there in the first place.

506
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,760
You know, I'm really glad I don't go in for all this anti-immigrant stuff myself.

507
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,040
I tie myself in knots trying to make it all make sense.

508
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,080
And they await their doom with smiles of tolerance and passivity, calm as Hindu cows.

509
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,720
Oh, fuck off with that Tyler Durden bullshit.

510
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,960
Looking again at Unwin's work, he leaves us with a stark dilemma.

511
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,360
It may not be possible to save the West.

512
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,720
According to his model, this process is irreversible,

513
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,760
and the only way to do so would be to restrict the sexual freedom of Western women

514
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,080
and move back to a more patriarchal society.

515
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,440
And here's where Black Pigeon really fucks it all up, good and proper.

516
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,880
He says that to save the West, according to Unwin's model,

517
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,640
we have to return to a patriarchal society.

518
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,120
So before we address this point, do you remember earlier when I said

519
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,560
I made two amateur mistakes before reading Unwin's book?

520
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,480
Well, here they are.

521
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,640
Firstly, I assumed that Black Pigeon was giving a fair representation of Unwin's work and opinions.

522
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,320
And secondly, I assumed that since this book is his primary source in the video,

523
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,400
that Black Pigeon had actually read the book.

524
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,640
So first off, let's take a look at the conclusion to Sex and Culture

525
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,680
and see what Unwin thinks about patriarchy.

526
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,520
It is difficult to express any opinion with complete confidence,

527
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,760
but as, at the end of my task, I look back along the stream of time,

528
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,040
it seems to me that it was the unequal fate of the women,

529
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,280
not the compulsory continent, that caused the downfall of absolute monogamy.

530
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:50,000
You see, Unwin sees a women's rights movement as a natural response

531
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,680
to a patriarchal society that is biased against women.

532
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,440
At no point does he argue for a return to a patriarchal system.

533
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,440
He traces the downfall of absolute monogamy to the unequal treatment of women.

534
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,520
And this is echoed in Hyposia,

535
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,840
which he thinks should have no legal differences between men and women.

536
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,400
The fundamental misunderstanding that Black Pigeon has with regards to Unwin's work

537
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,200
is that he appears to think that, when arguing for more restrictive sexual norms,

538
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,760
Unwin is talking specifically about women.

539
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,520
And that's not the case. He's talking about everyone.

540
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,040
A patriarchal society is bad for Unwin,

541
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,640
not just because it leads to a loss of societal energy,

542
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,400
but because it makes it too easy for men to get sex.

543
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,000
At one point, he cites the huge number of wives that a king has as a societal weakness.

544
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,320
And this brings up another point that's made clear by actually reading Unwin's work.

545
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,800
Unwin is talking mainly about the ruling class of a society.

546
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,840
He believes it's most important for rulers to be chaste and thus have a lot of energy.

547
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,160
And he thinks this attitude will filter down from the ruling class to the masses.

548
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,560
In Hyposia, he proposes two tiers of marriage.

549
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Alpha and beta marriages.

550
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,080
Alpha marriages will be unbreakable and for life.

551
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,440
And there will be strict punishments for people who are unfaithful.

552
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,560
Beta marriages will be more akin to our idea of a modern marriage.

553
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,920
Less restrictive and with divorce a possibility.

554
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,360
Anyone in the society could enter either type of marriage,

555
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,840
but only people in alpha marriages could occupy positions of leadership.

556
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,120
This is because it was more important for Unwin for the leaders of a society

557
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,720
to be chaste than the average person in the street.

558
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,600
And speaking of that, to close this video out,

559
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,400
I'll just note here that Black Pigeon is a supporter of Donald Trump.

560
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,680
And as you're probably aware, a hot mic recording of Donald Trump was recently released

561
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,600
in which the married Donald Trump brags about cheating on his then-pregnant wife

562
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,760
with other people's wives.

563
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,880
And I wonder what JD Unwin would think about that.

564
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,120
Well done. You made it to the end of the video.

565
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,600
Congratulations. I realized this was a bit of a long one. I'm very sorry.

566
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,040
If you'd like to see more videos like this,

567
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,340
uh...

568
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,200
Everyone always says like and subscribe at the end of these things.

569
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,120
I don't understand why that is meant to help me.

570
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,280
I mean, it's always nice when people like and subscribe and stuff, but

571
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,120
what happens if more people click like versus just not clicking anything?

572
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,360
I'm genuinely asking someone right in the comments how that's meant to actually help me out.

573
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,660
Um...

574
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,480
We've also- we've got the- we've got Twitter, we've got Ask FM, um...

575
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,120
Goodbye.
