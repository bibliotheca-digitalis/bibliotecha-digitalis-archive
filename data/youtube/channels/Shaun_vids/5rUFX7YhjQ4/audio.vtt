00:00.000 --> 00:07.180
This is a video about YouTuber BlackPigeonSpeaks, and in particular, his video entitled

00:07.180 --> 00:13.680
Why Women Destroy Nations Slash Civilizations and Other Uncomfortable Truths.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.840
No prizes for guessing what this one's about.

00:16.840 --> 00:22.640
If women's sexual preferences are liberated and go unchecked, they destroy civilizations.

00:22.640 --> 00:26.080
If women are allowed to choose, harems form.

00:26.080 --> 00:30.080
If women are allowed a voice in matters that pertain to the safety of a nation,

00:30.080 --> 00:32.720
then that nation will die, inevitably.

00:32.720 --> 00:38.560
And quite helpfully, BlackPigeon kicks off his video by laying out a list of his arguments.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.960
As this is a complicated subject, let me state briefly what I'm talking about in this video

00:42.960 --> 00:45.360
so you can follow along more closely.

00:45.360 --> 00:51.040
Women do not, on an instinctual level, care very much about her tribe, nation, or civilization.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.280
It's in their nature not to.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.080
Women are biological creatures, like all others,

00:56.080 --> 01:00.320
and they seek to maximize their chances of having viable offspring.

01:00.320 --> 01:05.280
This half-century-long experiment of women's liberation and political enfranchisement

01:05.280 --> 01:08.240
has ended in disaster for the West.

01:08.240 --> 01:11.760
And the damage done to the West may be irreparable,

01:11.760 --> 01:15.600
and the only solution would be a return to a more patriarchal society,

01:15.600 --> 01:18.160
and this seems highly unlikely.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.640
So, right off the bat there, we've got some extraordinary claims,

01:22.720 --> 01:28.480
and as we know, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.200
So we're going to go through BlackPigeon's video

01:31.200 --> 01:34.720
and take a look at the evidence behind these arguments.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.480
And as always, I'd encourage you to also watch BlackPigeon's video

01:38.480 --> 01:42.160
so you can be sure that I'm not misrepresenting his arguments.

01:42.880 --> 01:48.240
Now then, first up, we're going to look at his claim that women are inherently disloyal,

01:48.320 --> 01:51.840
and this is explained in the section of his video entitled,

01:51.840 --> 01:52.640
Betrayal.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.160
And let's get this out in the open.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.600
Women are not very good at being loyal to the tribe.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.000
They never have been, they never will be.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.400
The reason is it's not in their nature to do so.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.240
Women throughout history have shown time and time again

02:10.240 --> 02:14.560
they're quick to seek the favors of men they feel are stronger and more dominant,

02:14.560 --> 02:16.640
whether they're part of their in-group or not.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.120
Recent examples of this besides Japanese or Vietnamese war brides

02:21.120 --> 02:23.920
come from Europe and are illustrated by the countless numbers of

02:23.920 --> 02:26.560
Belgian, French, Dutch, what have you,

02:26.560 --> 02:30.480
women that took up relations with occupying German military personnel.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.920
And this was only a short time ago,

02:31.920 --> 02:35.040
but when Nazis were defeated and social stability was restored,

02:35.600 --> 02:39.840
they were punished for their betrayal and transgressions against their people.

02:39.840 --> 02:43.440
So for the argument that women are not loyal to their society or culture,

02:43.440 --> 02:47.200
Black Pigeon offers the evidence that some women sleep with, marry,

02:47.200 --> 02:52.080
or otherwise aid enemies of their country after it's been defeated in war.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.360
And this is because women are, quote,

02:55.360 --> 02:59.760
quick to seek the favors of men who are stronger or more dominant.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.680
And there's a few problems with this, but let's start at the beginning.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.160
Now the first news story that Black Pigeon uses is entitled,

03:08.160 --> 03:10.640
The Japanese Women Who Married the Enemy.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.320
And it's about Japanese women who met and married American soldiers

03:14.320 --> 03:17.360
after the surrender of Japan in the Second World War.

03:17.360 --> 03:22.320
And it quotes a Japanese woman who offers her reasons for doing so.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.200
Everything was crumbled as a result of the US bombing.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.720
You couldn't find streets or stores. It was a nightmare.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.720
We were struggling for food and lodging.

03:31.360 --> 03:35.040
I didn't know very much about Bill, his background or family,

03:35.040 --> 03:37.920
but I took a chance when he asked me to marry him.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.440
I couldn't live there. I had to get out to survive.

03:41.440 --> 03:46.240
Now nowhere does she say that she was enamored by how strong or dominant Bill was.

03:46.240 --> 03:50.960
Her choice was to marry Bill, or possibly starve to death.

03:50.960 --> 03:55.920
You know, Tokyo was pretty much totally destroyed at the end of the Second World War,

03:55.920 --> 03:59.680
and she married an American soldier to, you know, not die.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.400
And this point is echoed in the Daily Mail article that Black Pigeon cites

04:04.400 --> 04:09.120
talking about French women who worked as prostitutes for occupying German soldiers.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.600
Yet not all of the women had been prostitutes before the war.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.080
Some had been respectable housewives and mothers

04:16.080 --> 04:19.200
and claimed they were prostituting themselves only to eat.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.680
Now, also, Black Pigeon, it takes two to tango, if you know what I mean.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.720
For every woman who sleeps with or marries an enemy,

04:28.720 --> 04:33.360
does that not also require a man to sleep with or marry an enemy?

04:33.360 --> 04:36.320
Why are you only taking women to task for this?

04:36.320 --> 04:40.560
You know, by the same logic, that means women are disloyal if they shack up with an enemy.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.600
Aren't men just as disloyal for doing the same?

04:43.600 --> 04:46.160
Also, a lot of these women didn't have a choice.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.120
They were just trying to survive in hard times.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.480
But the men had a choice.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.400
You know, American men didn't have to marry Japanese women.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.160
They just did it because they wanted to.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.520
And of course, some men go further than just sleeping with or marrying the enemy.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.280
Sometimes, they fight for them.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.120
One of the last German units to see action in World War II

05:07.120 --> 05:10.160
was the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division,

05:10.160 --> 05:13.600
which participated in the defense of central Berlin.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.240
And that was comprised of French volunteers.

05:16.880 --> 05:20.320
And since Black Pigeon mentioned punishment after the fact,

05:20.320 --> 05:23.280
the leader of the French volunteers during the defense of Berlin

05:23.280 --> 05:26.160
was sentenced to 20 years hard labor.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.960
Others were imprisoned, and some were just shot upon being captured by the French.

05:31.520 --> 05:35.680
And of course, some Japanese people fought for America in the Second World War.

05:36.320 --> 05:40.400
The 442nd Infantry Regiment of the United States Army

05:40.400 --> 05:44.800
was made up almost entirely of soldiers of Japanese ancestry,

05:44.800 --> 05:48.960
and they're one of the most decorated units in American military history.

05:48.960 --> 05:53.280
So why don't the actions of these men prove that it's not in the nature of men

05:53.280 --> 05:55.600
to be loyal to their, quote, tribe?

05:56.160 --> 06:00.240
Black Pigeon is really holding men and women to different standards here.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.280
And speaking of that...

06:02.640 --> 06:05.680
Now, not only are women not punished for inviting

06:05.680 --> 06:09.680
alien and unassimilable armies of men into the West,

06:09.680 --> 06:13.120
they then vote for parties that force the entire society

06:13.120 --> 06:18.880
to have its national wealth redistributed to this army of aggressive and hostile men.

06:18.880 --> 06:24.240
Now first off, just because you have a photograph of some women holding a refugee's welcome sign

06:24.240 --> 06:27.600
doesn't mean that that sentiment is unique to women.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.920
Secondly, just a minor pet peeve of mine,

06:29.920 --> 06:34.800
but I hate that when people talk about immigrants disparagingly, they only ever say men.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.800
You know, look at this clip.

06:36.800 --> 06:42.000
There's men, there's women, there's children, there's all sorts of people.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.240
And the United Nations data on Syrian refugees puts the gender split at around 50-50.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.360
And of course, a large percentage of those are children.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.960
It's hardly an army.

06:52.960 --> 06:57.840
Black Pigeon's just only saying men because he thinks men are scarier, I guess.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.480
And I'm specifically talking about Syria here,

07:00.480 --> 07:06.960
because the image that Black Pigeon used was of free women welcoming Syrian refugees to Munich.

07:06.960 --> 07:11.280
And here's a video of the event, and you can see the sign in the background there.

07:11.280 --> 07:20.800
And look at this evil invading army of, like, regular families and children and elderly women.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.680
It's hardly the Nazis coming over the hill.

07:23.680 --> 07:27.680
Also, how do these women at all relate to the earlier point

07:27.680 --> 07:31.840
about women seeking the favour of stronger and more dominant men?

07:31.840 --> 07:38.160
You know, a refugee fleeing a failed state doesn't exactly scream dominant alpha male at me.

07:38.160 --> 07:44.400
I guess I just don't really see the comparison between these women and prostitutes in occupied France.

07:44.400 --> 07:51.040
The entire basis of Western society was the male agreement to keep only one woman in public,

07:51.040 --> 07:54.720
so that every male has near equal chance at reproduction.

07:54.720 --> 07:59.520
It's for this reason that organized and advanced civilizations have always needed to agree

07:59.520 --> 08:02.000
on the equitable distribution of women,

08:02.000 --> 08:08.160
so as to incentivize its men to produce and have a stake in the society's health and security.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.320
But this, like other cultural arrangements that held the West together for centuries,

08:12.320 --> 08:16.800
is breaking down, and can be observed in something as basic as the fact

08:16.800 --> 08:21.280
there are no Western countries that are even at replacement levels in their birth rates.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.320
This again can be laid at the feet of loosening of sexual morality and the dating habits of young women.

08:28.320 --> 08:33.360
Now, I couldn't find exactly where Black Pigeon found this particular fertility rate graph,

08:33.360 --> 08:36.480
but I saw the World Bank source down the bottom there,

08:36.480 --> 08:40.160
so I went to the World Bank website and had a look at their data.

08:40.800 --> 08:43.440
And they've got a neat little graph-making feature,

08:43.440 --> 08:49.680
so I first recreated the graph in Black Pigeon's video using those countries and date ranges.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.000
And as you can see, the graphs is the same.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.040
So the first thing to note here is that the fall of the fertility rate since the 1960s

08:59.040 --> 09:01.920
is not specific to Western countries.

09:01.920 --> 09:08.240
If we add in the worldwide average, we can see that over the specified date range, that's falling too.

09:08.240 --> 09:13.440
And the next thing to note is that the World Bank data only goes back to 1960,

09:13.440 --> 09:17.760
which is just far enough to catch the post-World War II baby boom.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.440
Now, I'm not gonna go into that much right now, but for those who don't know,

09:21.440 --> 09:26.720
people tended to postpone starting families during World War II, if possible, you know?

09:26.720 --> 09:34.000
The economy's terrible, the Nazis are invading, all the men are off fighting, it's a bad time to have kids.

09:34.560 --> 09:39.040
But once the war's over, you know, everyone gets back to the baby-making.

09:39.040 --> 09:43.920
Then once everyone who wants kids has had kids, there's generally a drop in the fertility rate

09:43.920 --> 09:49.200
because the new generation that was born isn't old enough to have their own kids for a couple of decades.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.760
And this is why you see the birth rate stabilize around 1980.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.160
If we cut the boom out and only look at the data from 1980 onwards,

09:58.160 --> 10:04.320
we see that the birth rates in those Western countries have actually been trending very slightly upwards.

10:04.320 --> 10:08.480
And they're much closer today to the worldwide average, which is still falling.

10:09.200 --> 10:14.080
Another point here is that by selecting certain countries and certain date ranges,

10:14.080 --> 10:16.880
you can basically make whatever point you like.

10:16.880 --> 10:21.040
And let's look at a few countries where the majority of people are Muslims and,

10:21.040 --> 10:25.040
oh God, would you look at that? The birth rates are plummeting off a cliff.

10:25.040 --> 10:30.160
Islam must be dying out pretty soon. There'll be no Muslims left at all.

10:30.160 --> 10:35.360
Also, one thing to understand is that female psychology has always been about adaptation.

10:35.360 --> 10:40.160
In our tribal past, if women of conquered tribes didn't submit to their new masters,

10:40.160 --> 10:44.560
they faced death along with their husbands, brothers, sons, fathers.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.360
Even today, many women seek out aggressive men, whether consciously or not,

10:49.360 --> 10:55.280
as it seems that this psychology has been ground into women after countless years of our species' evolution.

10:56.080 --> 11:03.200
That means criminals, gangsters, and mass murderers are always going to be more attractive to women than hard-working, honest men.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
They always have been, they always will be.

11:05.680 --> 11:11.360
Now, I won't deny that a certain number of people are attracted to that sort of notoriety,

11:11.360 --> 11:19.200
but I guarantee if you ask the average woman if she'd rather marry an average, honest, hard-working guy,

11:19.280 --> 11:27.520
or Charles fucking Manson, she's gonna pick the guy without the swastika tattoo on his forehead.

11:27.520 --> 11:34.880
Black Pigeon is again viewing the actions of a very small minority of women as representative of all women.

11:34.880 --> 11:40.320
Now, I don't have any studies for this on hand, but I did ask for women who I know personally

11:40.320 --> 11:45.600
if they'd rather marry a completely average man or Charles Manson.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.000
And they all said some variant of the sentence,

11:48.640 --> 11:51.680
Why the fuck would I ever marry Charles Manson?

11:51.680 --> 11:57.840
And that's anecdotal evidence, sure, but I'm willing to bet it generally holds true for most women.

11:57.840 --> 12:01.920
The culture of the sensitive man, the emotional man, the compassionate man,

12:01.920 --> 12:06.400
is at odds with what women are biologically predisposed to desire.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.040
Young women, if they tell you the truth, are drawn to the scoundrel,

12:11.040 --> 12:14.560
not the impeccable gentleman with the perfectly manicured fingernails.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.960
I'm afraid.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.560
You're trembling.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.560
I'm not trembling.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.800
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.120
You're not a scoundrel in your life.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.120
I happen to like nice men.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.120
I'm a nice man.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.120
Very nice.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.520
Okay, that's a movie, dude.

12:37.520 --> 12:43.600
You know, come on, don't cite a movie as your basis for claims about women's biological impulses.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.440
But to laughingly take this somewhat seriously for a moment,

12:47.440 --> 12:50.640
I'm gonna bet quite a lot of women's attraction to Han Solo

12:50.640 --> 12:54.480
is mainly because he looks like Harrison Ford in the 80s.

12:55.040 --> 12:59.040
You know, the Emperor is certainly more of a dominant alpha male than Han,

12:59.040 --> 13:02.160
but I don't see many women pining after him, oddly enough.

13:02.960 --> 13:08.640
However, we do all remember Leia's classic line after she meets Grand Moff Tarkin,

13:08.640 --> 13:09.920
where she says,

13:26.720 --> 13:29.840
So who knows, maybe Black Pigeon is onto something here.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.760
Let's move on.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.960
It's so much a part of women's psyche to want the scoundrel,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.520
that it's wrapped up in their very DNA.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.080
Just to get this out of the way, because I have a feeling it might show up in the comments,

13:42.080 --> 13:47.360
yes, I am aware that the vast majority of women, when raped, reach sexual clim-

13:47.360 --> 13:51.760
Whoa, uh, hang on, I'm not touching this bit, let's move further on.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.560
Once women were given equal say in the sphere of politics,

13:54.560 --> 14:00.640
it was only a matter of time until our civilization was swept up by the event horizon of its own collapse.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.760
All kinds of studies have been done on this subject,

14:03.760 --> 14:08.240
as this one from Columbia University, and they all, without exception,

14:08.240 --> 14:12.480
note that as women become more quote-unquote emancipated,

14:12.480 --> 14:15.120
the decline of the family is further accelerated.

14:15.120 --> 14:21.120
And as the family disintegrates and women move politically further and further to the left in their voting,

14:21.120 --> 14:25.440
many then begin to use the government as a surrogate husband and provider.

14:25.440 --> 14:31.920
So here, Black Pigeon is arguing that women are moving further and further to the left in their voting.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.400
But let's take a look at his sources here.

14:34.400 --> 14:39.760
First, the study, uh, entitled, Why Have Women Become Left-Wing?

14:39.760 --> 14:45.360
which is looking at the reasons that more women than men in the United States vote for the Democrats.

14:45.360 --> 14:51.200
And in particular, it's looking at why the gender gap has been widening over the last few decades.

14:51.200 --> 14:57.920
Now, if you just read the headline, you might get the sense that men occupy some sort of fixed political position,

14:57.920 --> 15:01.760
and the gender gap is only caused by women moving to the left.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.840
But if you read the study, it also mentions the inverse of that,

15:05.840 --> 15:10.400
which is men moving further to the right to support the Republicans.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.960
And this is something that Black Pigeon's next source goes into in more detail.

15:14.960 --> 15:20.720
Uh, this headline, Why Do Women Vote Differently Than Men? is from Slate.com.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.560
And this is some excellent tactical cropping from Black Pigeon here,

15:24.560 --> 15:29.520
because if we scroll down just an inch, we can read the subheader.

15:29.520 --> 15:34.720
Despite stereotypes, men are actually more fickle at the voting booth.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.920
And this article argues that it's men moving to the right,

15:37.920 --> 15:42.480
more so than women moving to the left, that is responsible for the gender gap.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.680
And I quote,

15:43.680 --> 15:48.000
So did women move away from Reagan and his party in disgust?

15:48.000 --> 15:55.440
No. Rather, women's emerging belief in their own political entitlement permitted them to stay right where they were.

15:55.440 --> 16:02.160
Reagan struck a chord with men, so men moved in a more Republican direction while women stayed put.

16:02.160 --> 16:09.200
Kaufmann of the University of Maryland has looked at long-term election study data from 1952 to 2004

16:09.200 --> 16:13.920
and observed that men's support for the Democratic Party declined from the mid-70s

16:13.920 --> 16:16.640
through the eight years of Reagan's presidency,

16:16.640 --> 16:21.120
and has remained at that lower level, with small fluctuations ever since.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.960
In contrast, she writes,

16:28.960 --> 16:33.760
And this isn't me going out and looking for some source to contradict Black Pigeon's claims here.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.400
This article is in his video.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.560
Well, the headline is, anyway.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.400
And let's look at the next headline.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.560
Women Today Have a New Husband.

16:42.560 --> 16:46.800
And this is from the website theprimalmale.com.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.760
Uh, not a publication I'd heard of.

16:49.840 --> 16:54.080
And what does this article have to say about women and the government?

17:07.600 --> 17:08.560
Yikes.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.240
And this website has some other interesting articles, like, uh,

17:12.240 --> 17:14.320
Friendship with Women is Unnatural,

17:15.120 --> 17:17.200
Modern Women's Contempt for Men,

17:17.840 --> 17:18.560
uh,

17:18.560 --> 17:22.000
what it feels like to be a nihilist, in which the author states,

17:43.360 --> 17:44.240
Jeez.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.520
It sounds like someone doesn't have any loyalty for his tribe.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.280
Now then, apologies for the length of this next clip,

17:51.280 --> 17:55.200
but it does represent the main source behind Black Pigeon's arguments,

17:55.200 --> 17:58.000
so we're gonna have to watch all of it, I'm afraid.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.080
In one of the most comprehensive studies of civilizational decline,

18:02.080 --> 18:06.000
J.D. Unwin postulates in his book, Sex and Culture,

18:06.000 --> 18:07.520
written in 1934,

18:14.800 --> 18:19.440
Unwin, a British social anthropologist at Oxford and Cambridge universities,

18:19.440 --> 18:23.360
studied 86 different cultures through 5,000 years of history,

18:23.360 --> 18:28.480
and found a positive correlation between the cultural achievement of a people,

18:28.480 --> 18:31.200
and the sexual restraint they observed.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.560
Unwin's impetus for the project was to test the Freudian theory

18:34.560 --> 18:38.800
that civilizational progress was the product of repressed sexuality.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.280
He found that discipline in sexual matters appropriated social energy

18:43.280 --> 18:44.800
to more civilizational ends.

18:45.520 --> 18:50.240
It's very complicated, but for Unwin, the fabric of society was primarily sexual,

18:50.240 --> 18:54.240
and heterosexual monogamy was the optimal arrangement for the planning,

18:54.240 --> 18:57.120
building, protecting, and nurturing of the family.

18:57.120 --> 19:00.560
If enough heterosexual partners made a monogamous commitment,

19:00.560 --> 19:03.840
civilizational energy was directed toward promoting

19:03.840 --> 19:06.560
the finest societal foundation possible.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.960
Without exception, each civilization he studied allowed its success

19:10.960 --> 19:12.880
to alter its moral code.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.640
According to Unwin, after a nation becomes increasingly liberal

19:16.640 --> 19:18.960
with regards to its sexual morality,

19:18.960 --> 19:23.760
it loses its cohesion, its impetus, and its purpose.

19:23.760 --> 19:28.560
From a chaste moral code, societies gain what he called expansive energy,

19:28.560 --> 19:32.880
and this energy allowed these cultures to expand into other weaker cultures.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.720
Okay, so let's talk about J.D. Unwin.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.960
Now, when someone first recommended I make a video about Black Pigeon,

19:40.960 --> 19:45.760
this Why Women Destroy Civilizations video was the first one I clicked on.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.360
And before I watched it, I thought,

19:47.360 --> 19:49.120
oh, well, this will be easy.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.800
He'll obviously at some point list some example civilizations

19:52.800 --> 19:54.720
that have been destroyed by women,

19:54.720 --> 19:56.480
and then I can just counter those.

19:56.480 --> 20:00.800
You know, for example, I imagined at some point Black Pigeon would say something like,

20:00.800 --> 20:03.280
women's rights destroyed the Roman Empire,

20:03.280 --> 20:05.440
and then I could just list off a bunch of reasons

20:05.440 --> 20:08.000
that the Roman Empire actually collapsed

20:08.000 --> 20:12.880
and make him seem foolish for oversimplifying it and pinning everything just on women.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.880
So that was my plan going into this.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.840
However, as you may have noticed by now,

20:17.840 --> 20:22.320
Black Pigeon has not directly mentioned even one actual civilization

20:22.320 --> 20:24.560
that's collapsed because of women's rights.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.760
And nor does he ever, actually, in the entire video.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.640
The only examples he gives are indirect.

20:30.640 --> 20:34.640
He says that this J.D. Unwin guy found a bunch of civilizations

20:34.640 --> 20:36.560
that were destroyed by women's rights.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.360
So I thought, okay, new plan.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.360
To get a concrete example here,

20:41.360 --> 20:45.920
what I'm gonna have to do is go and read Sex and Culture by J.D. Unwin,

20:45.920 --> 20:51.120
get to the bit where he says women's rights destroyed the Roman Empire or something like that,

20:51.120 --> 20:56.000
and then I can counter that and, by proxy, prove Black Pigeon wrong.

20:56.560 --> 21:00.080
So I went and read Sex and Culture by J.D. Unwin,

21:00.080 --> 21:04.400
and as I read it, I realized I'd made two very amateur mistakes,

21:04.400 --> 21:06.400
but we'll get back to those in a little while.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.000
First, let's talk about Unwin's book.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.320
Now, if you search online for J.D. Unwin,

21:12.320 --> 21:16.320
you mainly only find him and his book mentioned in the same terms

21:16.320 --> 21:18.480
that Black Pigeon is presenting it here.

21:19.040 --> 21:22.320
Unwin seems to be quite popular in alt-right circles,

21:22.320 --> 21:26.400
as someone who predicted that feminism will destroy the West.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.120
But is that what his book actually says?

21:29.760 --> 21:31.280
Well, let's take a look.

21:31.840 --> 21:35.280
So, by and large, Black Pigeon does, initially,

21:35.280 --> 21:38.880
give a fair representation of Unwin's general argument.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.320
Unwin looked at a bunch of different cultures and civilizations

21:42.320 --> 21:44.400
and sorted them into a hierarchy.

21:44.960 --> 21:48.320
The exact specifics of which aren't terribly relevant for us right now,

21:48.320 --> 21:52.080
but generally, the top of the scale represents more, quote,

21:52.080 --> 21:54.640
advanced and civilized societies,

21:54.640 --> 21:58.960
and the bottom of the scale, the less advanced and less civilized.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.720
Now, what Unwin found was that societies nearer the top of his scale

22:02.720 --> 22:07.280
tended to have more restrictive sexual norms than the societies lower on the scale.

22:08.080 --> 22:11.120
Unwin also sees everything in terms of energy,

22:11.120 --> 22:15.680
you know, expansive energy for a society to expand its territory,

22:15.680 --> 22:19.600
creative energy to invent new things, and so on.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.400
And he argues that societies further up the scale

22:22.400 --> 22:25.840
have more energy than those lower on the scale.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.240
And beyond just proving the correlation,

22:28.240 --> 22:31.200
Unwin argues that the restricted sexual norms

22:31.200 --> 22:34.560
are the cause of the increased societal energy,

22:34.560 --> 22:38.400
and he thinks that if sexual relations are too easy to attain,

22:38.400 --> 22:41.040
then a society will lose its energy.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.120
I mean, basically, his argument is this.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.320
Did you notice what went wrong in that scene?

22:46.320 --> 22:50.000
Ordinarily, Billy would work hard to make money with his paper route.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.720
Then he'd use the money to buy dinner for Mavis,

22:52.720 --> 22:56.560
thus earning a slim chance to perform the reproductive act.

22:56.560 --> 23:00.640
But in a world where teens can date robots, why should he bother?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.400
Why should anyone bother?

23:02.400 --> 23:05.040
Let's take a look at Billy's planet a year later.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.680
Where are all the football stars?

23:08.240 --> 23:10.400
And where are the biochemists?

23:10.400 --> 23:11.440
They're trapped.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.880
Trapped in the soft vice-like grip of robot lips.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.480
All civilization was just an effort to impress the opposite sex.

23:21.360 --> 23:26.400
With robots being a stand-in for easy access to sex there, I guess.

23:26.480 --> 23:30.960
So there you go, you are now up to speed on J.D. Unwin's sex and culture.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.840
So what do we think of his argument?

23:33.840 --> 23:36.000
Well, just personally, I think that,

23:36.000 --> 23:40.560
beyond being too quick to discard examples that go against his hypothesis,

23:40.560 --> 23:44.560
Unwin generally proves the correlation between restricted sexual norms

23:44.560 --> 23:47.680
and the advancement of civilization just fine.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.400
But I'm not sold on it being causative.

23:50.400 --> 23:55.040
In my opinion, for a society to actually be able to enforce sexual norms,

23:55.040 --> 23:58.400
it generally has to have things like a strong government,

23:58.400 --> 24:01.360
a legal system capable of imposing punishments,

24:01.920 --> 24:05.680
usually a state religion to provide some religious justification.

24:06.320 --> 24:10.080
And a society which has these things is typically gonna find itself

24:10.080 --> 24:12.960
near at the top of Unwin's list anyway.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.960
So I'd say restricted sexual norms just tend to go hand in hand

24:16.960 --> 24:21.680
with the advancement of civilization rather than being the direct cause of it.

24:21.680 --> 24:24.960
Now, I tend to agree with Aldous Huxley's view of Unwin.

24:25.120 --> 24:28.000
Who thought sex and culture was a very significant work,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.680
but that Unwin was guilty of oversimplification.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.320
And this quote is taken from Huxley's introduction

24:34.320 --> 24:38.320
to Unwin's posthumously published follow-up to sex and culture,

24:38.320 --> 24:39.920
which we'll get to later.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.720
This oversimplification is twofold.

24:42.720 --> 24:46.160
There is what may be called the extensional oversimplification,

24:46.160 --> 24:48.560
which consists in the omission to consider

24:48.560 --> 24:52.080
all the significant factors existing at a given time.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.560
And there is a temporal oversimplification,

24:54.560 --> 24:56.560
which is the failure to take into account

24:56.560 --> 24:58.720
the occasional and unpredictable emergence

24:58.720 --> 25:01.200
into actuality of entirely new entities.

25:02.080 --> 25:02.800
It's a mouthful.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.480
Now, what Huxley's saying there, basically,

25:06.480 --> 25:08.960
is Unwin misses a lot of shit out.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.840
And he goes on to name a ton of things that represent

25:11.840 --> 25:15.280
an equal or greater effect on a society's success

25:15.280 --> 25:18.880
than the particular restrictiveness of its sexual norms.

25:18.880 --> 25:22.240
You know, agricultural and technological advancement,

25:22.240 --> 25:27.840
religion, nutrition, warfare, scientific discovery, diplomacy, and so on.

25:28.400 --> 25:33.120
For Huxley, focusing too much on one specific societal element,

25:33.120 --> 25:36.720
like Unwin does with sexual norms,

25:36.720 --> 25:39.760
won't give you the full picture of how a society works.

25:40.320 --> 25:43.920
And Huxley also raises another excellent point when he asks,

25:44.640 --> 25:48.080
Do the conditions which make for a display of maximum energy

25:48.080 --> 25:52.640
also and automatically make for a display of the best kind of energy?

25:52.640 --> 25:56.080
Are the most energetic individuals and societies

25:56.080 --> 25:59.760
necessarily the most kindly, forbearing, and peaceable?

25:59.760 --> 26:01.440
And this is a very good question.

26:01.440 --> 26:06.080
I mean, Nazi Germany certainly had a lot of expansive and creative energy.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.760
No one can deny that.

26:07.760 --> 26:11.840
It had so much expansive energy, in fact, that it got itself destroyed.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.560
Now, before we get back to Black Pigeon,

26:14.560 --> 26:18.000
I just want to make one more note about Unwin.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.040
In Sex and Culture, he was approaching the issue strictly as a scientist.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.400
For him, human civilizations are deterministic.

26:27.040 --> 26:32.000
He makes no moral judgments, and aside from a few sentences in his conclusion,

26:32.000 --> 26:33.920
he offers no political guidance.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.760
In his later work, entitled Hyposia, however,

26:37.760 --> 26:41.040
he creates an imaginary country called Hyposia,

26:41.040 --> 26:45.280
which has all the elements which, for him, would allow the society

26:45.280 --> 26:49.680
to be the most energetic and productive for the longest possible time.

26:49.680 --> 26:55.600
So by reading that book, we can get a picture of exactly the sort of society that Unwin would want.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.400
But we'll get back to that shortly.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.800
For now, let's return to Black Pigeon.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.000
Now, when you compare the modern Western world with the Islamic one,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.280
you see exactly the results that Unwin's theory would predict.

27:07.840 --> 27:10.000
By allowing women to fuck freely...

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
Whoa! The mask slipped a bit there, dude.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.280
I don't think I can say the word fuck with that level of venom.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.640
By allowing women to fuck freely...

27:21.840 --> 27:22.340
Ugh!

27:23.440 --> 27:25.520
By allowing women to fuck freely,

27:25.520 --> 27:30.880
the West has de facto entered a matriarchy that disincentivizes young men.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.080
Islam, on the other hand, keeps their women chaste,

27:34.080 --> 27:37.280
and their expansive energy, as Unwin's theory predicts,

27:37.360 --> 27:40.000
is manifested in what we're observing today.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.280
The Islamic culture is the one who's expanding into the West.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.760
Okay, so a brief point here.

27:46.560 --> 27:50.160
Syrian refugees are some people fleeing a war zone.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.320
They are not an organized army.

27:52.880 --> 27:57.040
I can think of several instances, from my lifetime even,

27:57.040 --> 28:01.920
when the West has been the invading armed force in a lot of Islamic countries.

28:02.560 --> 28:07.600
I mean, in my lifetime, the United States actually invaded Iraq,

28:08.240 --> 28:10.320
and took over the government.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.840
But let's look at Unwin's hypothetical country of Hyposia,

28:13.840 --> 28:15.760
and see how that would treat immigrants.

28:16.480 --> 28:22.240
Another important part of a society's existence is its contact with other societies.

28:22.240 --> 28:27.440
In a sluggish, uncivilized society, strangers are feared greatly.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.600
Not because there is anything objectively fearsome about them,

28:31.600 --> 28:38.080
but because they are strange, unusual beings who behave and speak in strange, unusual ways.

28:38.080 --> 28:43.440
And this attitude toward strangers is also apparent among the less cultured members

28:43.440 --> 28:50.080
of an energetic society, who will not have anything to do with a foreigner if they can help it.

28:50.080 --> 28:55.600
Even in a rationalistic society, strangers are seldom treated in the same way as natives,

28:55.600 --> 29:01.520
and in Hyposia, the duty of maintaining a sympathetic relation with other societies will

29:02.480 --> 29:04.000
be allotted to special men.

29:04.560 --> 29:11.840
You see, Unwin likes energy, and diversity of people, of thought, of whatever, for him is more energetic.

29:12.640 --> 29:18.400
He doesn't want culture to stay the same. He wants it to change and adapt to new circumstances.

29:19.040 --> 29:23.760
So enough about J.D. Unwin for now. Let's talk about Sweden.

29:24.480 --> 29:28.560
The total and complete feminization of Sweden and its men

29:28.560 --> 29:32.880
have allowed their women to invite their country's own destruction

29:32.880 --> 29:38.240
through the importation of millions of unassimilatable and aggressive people

29:38.240 --> 29:41.040
from completely alien cultures.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.960
Not only are they borrowing money to fund the colonization of their country,

29:44.960 --> 29:48.560
but they are now even creating gender imbalances

29:48.560 --> 29:53.680
that will have severe and lasting repercussions on their society's future.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.840
So something about that last source there seemed a little off to me.

29:57.840 --> 30:02.640
You know, not only does it appear to have been written by someone called Fuzzy Slippers,

30:03.280 --> 30:05.760
the claim seems a little suspect.

30:05.760 --> 30:09.600
A worse gender imbalance than China? Really?

30:09.600 --> 30:11.120
Well, let's investigate.

30:11.760 --> 30:17.920
So this headline comes from a conservative website called LegalInsurrection.com,

30:17.920 --> 30:26.160
and in it, Fuzzy Slippers is giving their interpretation of a January 2016 BBC story entitled

30:26.800 --> 30:30.000
Why Does Sweden Have More Boys Than Girls?

30:30.000 --> 30:33.680
So the first thing to note here is that the data in this news story

30:33.680 --> 30:37.680
specifically looks at 16 and 17-year-olds,

30:37.680 --> 30:41.840
which is, of course, not mentioned by BlackPigeon in his video.

30:41.840 --> 30:48.720
Now then, normally, on average, there are 105 boys born for every 100 girls,

30:48.720 --> 30:54.240
and in Sweden in 2014, there were 108 boys for every 100 girls.

30:54.800 --> 30:58.400
So that's hardly that dramatic of a difference so far.

30:58.400 --> 31:05.120
Now, in China, there are 117 boys to every 100 girls in that age range.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.440
So what's going on here?

31:07.440 --> 31:12.960
In just one year, how has the average number of boys in that age range in Sweden

31:12.960 --> 31:14.400
jumped higher than China?

31:15.120 --> 31:19.840
Or at least, how has it appeared to have jumped higher than China?

31:19.840 --> 31:22.480
Well, if we look at this graph from the BBC article,

31:22.480 --> 31:27.760
we see that the vast majority of asylum applicants are males in that age range.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.680
So, why is that?

31:29.680 --> 31:32.160
Well, according to this news story anyway,

31:32.160 --> 31:37.760
it's to do with a particular right to family reunification that they have in Sweden.

31:37.760 --> 31:43.200
It seems like if you apply for asylum in Sweden before you're 18 and you're successful,

31:43.760 --> 31:46.880
you can then apply for family reunification,

31:46.880 --> 31:50.080
and your family can get in on your residency permit.

31:50.800 --> 31:54.400
Now, that's obviously quite an attractive prospect for a lot of people,

31:54.400 --> 31:59.840
and it does explain why there's such a high number of male applicants in that age range.

31:59.840 --> 32:03.760
I'm saying applicants because that's all they are at this point.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.080
They've applied for asylum.

32:06.080 --> 32:10.160
Now, the large gender imbalance cited by legalinsurrection.com

32:10.160 --> 32:15.360
is from an estimate by Valerie Hudson of Texas A&M University,

32:15.360 --> 32:18.160
and there's something very important to note here.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.880
Her estimate was made under the assumption that

32:20.880 --> 32:26.080
every single asylum applicant would be granted a residency permit,

32:26.080 --> 32:30.080
which, to put it lightly, is not very realistic.

32:30.080 --> 32:35.040
Although, I admit, I'm cheating a bit here by writing this ten months in the future,

32:35.040 --> 32:40.160
where I know that Sweden rejected half of the asylum seekers who applied in 2015.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.760
Hindsight is 2020, as they say.

32:43.760 --> 32:47.440
The second thing to note here is that these 16 and 17-year-olds

32:47.440 --> 32:50.720
were applying so disproportionately for asylum in Sweden

32:51.520 --> 32:56.240
so that they could use the right to reunification to get their families in.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.840
Now, I doubt that Black Pigeon would be too happy about that, to be honest,

32:59.840 --> 33:03.520
but what it does mean is, even if they did all get in,

33:03.520 --> 33:06.640
the gender imbalance stats no longer check out.

33:06.640 --> 33:10.240
Because if a teenager is successful in his asylum application,

33:10.240 --> 33:15.440
and then he invites his mum and his gran and auntie and three sisters over,

33:15.440 --> 33:17.600
you know, the gender imbalance disappears.

33:18.160 --> 33:22.320
Sweden does not have a gender imbalance worse than China.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.400
There are more women than men in Sweden.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.720
For this headline to make any sense at all,

33:28.720 --> 33:32.720
you first have to only be talking about 16 and 17-year-olds,

33:33.440 --> 33:38.240
then you have to assume that every single male applicant for asylum will get in,

33:38.960 --> 33:45.040
and then you have to assume that they will not take advantage of the right to family reunification.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.880
Which seems to be the reason they were applying there in the first place.

33:49.440 --> 33:53.760
You know, I'm really glad I don't go in for all this anti-immigrant stuff myself.

33:53.760 --> 33:57.040
I tie myself in knots trying to make it all make sense.

33:57.760 --> 34:04.080
And they await their doom with smiles of tolerance and passivity, calm as Hindu cows.

34:04.640 --> 34:08.720
Oh, fuck off with that Tyler Durden bullshit.

34:08.720 --> 34:12.960
Looking again at Unwin's work, he leaves us with a stark dilemma.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.360
It may not be possible to save the West.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.720
According to his model, this process is irreversible,

34:18.720 --> 34:23.760
and the only way to do so would be to restrict the sexual freedom of Western women

34:23.760 --> 34:26.080
and move back to a more patriarchal society.

34:27.040 --> 34:31.440
And here's where Black Pigeon really fucks it all up, good and proper.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.880
He says that to save the West, according to Unwin's model,

34:35.520 --> 34:38.640
we have to return to a patriarchal society.

34:39.360 --> 34:43.120
So before we address this point, do you remember earlier when I said

34:43.120 --> 34:46.560
I made two amateur mistakes before reading Unwin's book?

34:47.200 --> 34:48.480
Well, here they are.

34:48.480 --> 34:54.640
Firstly, I assumed that Black Pigeon was giving a fair representation of Unwin's work and opinions.

34:55.280 --> 35:00.320
And secondly, I assumed that since this book is his primary source in the video,

35:00.880 --> 35:04.400
that Black Pigeon had actually read the book.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.640
So first off, let's take a look at the conclusion to Sex and Culture

35:08.640 --> 35:11.680
and see what Unwin thinks about patriarchy.

35:11.680 --> 35:15.520
It is difficult to express any opinion with complete confidence,

35:15.520 --> 35:19.760
but as, at the end of my task, I look back along the stream of time,

35:19.760 --> 35:23.040
it seems to me that it was the unequal fate of the women,

35:23.680 --> 35:29.280
not the compulsory continent, that caused the downfall of absolute monogamy.

35:29.280 --> 35:50.000
You see, Unwin sees a women's rights movement as a natural response

35:50.000 --> 35:53.680
to a patriarchal society that is biased against women.

35:53.680 --> 35:57.440
At no point does he argue for a return to a patriarchal system.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.440
He traces the downfall of absolute monogamy to the unequal treatment of women.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.520
And this is echoed in Hyposia,

36:05.520 --> 36:09.840
which he thinks should have no legal differences between men and women.

36:09.840 --> 36:14.400
The fundamental misunderstanding that Black Pigeon has with regards to Unwin's work

36:14.400 --> 36:19.200
is that he appears to think that, when arguing for more restrictive sexual norms,

36:19.200 --> 36:21.760
Unwin is talking specifically about women.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.520
And that's not the case. He's talking about everyone.

36:26.080 --> 36:29.040
A patriarchal society is bad for Unwin,

36:29.040 --> 36:32.640
not just because it leads to a loss of societal energy,

36:32.640 --> 36:36.400
but because it makes it too easy for men to get sex.

36:36.400 --> 36:42.000
At one point, he cites the huge number of wives that a king has as a societal weakness.

36:42.720 --> 36:48.320
And this brings up another point that's made clear by actually reading Unwin's work.

36:48.320 --> 36:52.800
Unwin is talking mainly about the ruling class of a society.

36:52.800 --> 36:57.840
He believes it's most important for rulers to be chaste and thus have a lot of energy.

36:57.840 --> 37:02.160
And he thinks this attitude will filter down from the ruling class to the masses.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.560
In Hyposia, he proposes two tiers of marriage.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.560
Alpha and beta marriages.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.080
Alpha marriages will be unbreakable and for life.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.440
And there will be strict punishments for people who are unfaithful.

37:16.080 --> 37:20.560
Beta marriages will be more akin to our idea of a modern marriage.

37:20.560 --> 37:23.920
Less restrictive and with divorce a possibility.

37:23.920 --> 37:27.360
Anyone in the society could enter either type of marriage,

37:27.360 --> 37:31.840
but only people in alpha marriages could occupy positions of leadership.

37:32.480 --> 37:37.120
This is because it was more important for Unwin for the leaders of a society

37:37.120 --> 37:40.720
to be chaste than the average person in the street.

37:40.720 --> 37:43.600
And speaking of that, to close this video out,

37:43.600 --> 37:48.400
I'll just note here that Black Pigeon is a supporter of Donald Trump.

37:48.400 --> 37:53.680
And as you're probably aware, a hot mic recording of Donald Trump was recently released

37:53.680 --> 37:59.600
in which the married Donald Trump brags about cheating on his then-pregnant wife

37:59.600 --> 38:01.760
with other people's wives.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.880
And I wonder what JD Unwin would think about that.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.120
Well done. You made it to the end of the video.

38:09.120 --> 38:13.600
Congratulations. I realized this was a bit of a long one. I'm very sorry.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.040
If you'd like to see more videos like this,

38:17.840 --> 38:18.340
uh...

38:20.000 --> 38:23.200
Everyone always says like and subscribe at the end of these things.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.120
I don't understand why that is meant to help me.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.280
I mean, it's always nice when people like and subscribe and stuff, but

38:32.560 --> 38:37.120
what happens if more people click like versus just not clicking anything?

38:38.640 --> 38:43.360
I'm genuinely asking someone right in the comments how that's meant to actually help me out.

38:44.160 --> 38:44.660
Um...

38:45.200 --> 38:50.480
We've also- we've got the- we've got Twitter, we've got Ask FM, um...

38:52.240 --> 38:53.120
Goodbye.
