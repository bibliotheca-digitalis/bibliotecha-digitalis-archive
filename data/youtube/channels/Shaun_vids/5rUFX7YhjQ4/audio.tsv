0	7180	This is a video about YouTuber BlackPigeonSpeaks, and in particular, his video entitled
7180	13680	Why Women Destroy Nations Slash Civilizations and Other Uncomfortable Truths.
13680	16840	No prizes for guessing what this one's about.
16840	22640	If women's sexual preferences are liberated and go unchecked, they destroy civilizations.
22640	26080	If women are allowed to choose, harems form.
26080	30080	If women are allowed a voice in matters that pertain to the safety of a nation,
30080	32720	then that nation will die, inevitably.
32720	38560	And quite helpfully, BlackPigeon kicks off his video by laying out a list of his arguments.
38560	42960	As this is a complicated subject, let me state briefly what I'm talking about in this video
42960	45360	so you can follow along more closely.
45360	51040	Women do not, on an instinctual level, care very much about her tribe, nation, or civilization.
51040	53280	It's in their nature not to.
53360	56080	Women are biological creatures, like all others,
56080	60320	and they seek to maximize their chances of having viable offspring.
60320	65280	This half-century-long experiment of women's liberation and political enfranchisement
65280	68240	has ended in disaster for the West.
68240	71760	And the damage done to the West may be irreparable,
71760	75600	and the only solution would be a return to a more patriarchal society,
75600	78160	and this seems highly unlikely.
78160	82640	So, right off the bat there, we've got some extraordinary claims,
82720	88480	and as we know, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
88480	91200	So we're going to go through BlackPigeon's video
91200	94720	and take a look at the evidence behind these arguments.
94720	98480	And as always, I'd encourage you to also watch BlackPigeon's video
98480	102160	so you can be sure that I'm not misrepresenting his arguments.
102880	108240	Now then, first up, we're going to look at his claim that women are inherently disloyal,
108320	111840	and this is explained in the section of his video entitled,
111840	112640	Betrayal.
116480	118160	And let's get this out in the open.
118160	121600	Women are not very good at being loyal to the tribe.
121600	124000	They never have been, they never will be.
124000	126400	The reason is it's not in their nature to do so.
127200	130240	Women throughout history have shown time and time again
130240	134560	they're quick to seek the favors of men they feel are stronger and more dominant,
134560	136640	whether they're part of their in-group or not.
137200	141120	Recent examples of this besides Japanese or Vietnamese war brides
141120	143920	come from Europe and are illustrated by the countless numbers of
143920	146560	Belgian, French, Dutch, what have you,
146560	150480	women that took up relations with occupying German military personnel.
150480	151920	And this was only a short time ago,
151920	155040	but when Nazis were defeated and social stability was restored,
155600	159840	they were punished for their betrayal and transgressions against their people.
159840	163440	So for the argument that women are not loyal to their society or culture,
163440	167200	Black Pigeon offers the evidence that some women sleep with, marry,
167200	172080	or otherwise aid enemies of their country after it's been defeated in war.
172720	175360	And this is because women are, quote,
175360	179760	quick to seek the favors of men who are stronger or more dominant.
180480	183680	And there's a few problems with this, but let's start at the beginning.
184400	188160	Now the first news story that Black Pigeon uses is entitled,
188160	190640	The Japanese Women Who Married the Enemy.
190640	194320	And it's about Japanese women who met and married American soldiers
194320	197360	after the surrender of Japan in the Second World War.
197360	202320	And it quotes a Japanese woman who offers her reasons for doing so.
202320	205200	Everything was crumbled as a result of the US bombing.
205200	208720	You couldn't find streets or stores. It was a nightmare.
208720	210720	We were struggling for food and lodging.
211360	215040	I didn't know very much about Bill, his background or family,
215040	217920	but I took a chance when he asked me to marry him.
217920	221440	I couldn't live there. I had to get out to survive.
221440	226240	Now nowhere does she say that she was enamored by how strong or dominant Bill was.
226240	230960	Her choice was to marry Bill, or possibly starve to death.
230960	235920	You know, Tokyo was pretty much totally destroyed at the end of the Second World War,
235920	239680	and she married an American soldier to, you know, not die.
240480	244400	And this point is echoed in the Daily Mail article that Black Pigeon cites
244400	249120	talking about French women who worked as prostitutes for occupying German soldiers.
250080	253600	Yet not all of the women had been prostitutes before the war.
253600	256080	Some had been respectable housewives and mothers
256080	259200	and claimed they were prostituting themselves only to eat.
260000	265680	Now, also, Black Pigeon, it takes two to tango, if you know what I mean.
265680	268720	For every woman who sleeps with or marries an enemy,
268720	273360	does that not also require a man to sleep with or marry an enemy?
273360	276320	Why are you only taking women to task for this?
276320	280560	You know, by the same logic, that means women are disloyal if they shack up with an enemy.
280560	283600	Aren't men just as disloyal for doing the same?
283600	286160	Also, a lot of these women didn't have a choice.
286160	289120	They were just trying to survive in hard times.
289120	290480	But the men had a choice.
291280	294400	You know, American men didn't have to marry Japanese women.
294400	296160	They just did it because they wanted to.
296880	301520	And of course, some men go further than just sleeping with or marrying the enemy.
301520	303280	Sometimes, they fight for them.
303840	307120	One of the last German units to see action in World War II
307120	310160	was the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division,
310160	313600	which participated in the defense of central Berlin.
313600	316240	And that was comprised of French volunteers.
316880	320320	And since Black Pigeon mentioned punishment after the fact,
320320	323280	the leader of the French volunteers during the defense of Berlin
323280	326160	was sentenced to 20 years hard labor.
326160	330960	Others were imprisoned, and some were just shot upon being captured by the French.
331520	335680	And of course, some Japanese people fought for America in the Second World War.
336320	340400	The 442nd Infantry Regiment of the United States Army
340400	344800	was made up almost entirely of soldiers of Japanese ancestry,
344800	348960	and they're one of the most decorated units in American military history.
348960	353280	So why don't the actions of these men prove that it's not in the nature of men
353280	355600	to be loyal to their, quote, tribe?
356160	360240	Black Pigeon is really holding men and women to different standards here.
360320	361280	And speaking of that...
362640	365680	Now, not only are women not punished for inviting
365680	369680	alien and unassimilable armies of men into the West,
369680	373120	they then vote for parties that force the entire society
373120	378880	to have its national wealth redistributed to this army of aggressive and hostile men.
378880	384240	Now first off, just because you have a photograph of some women holding a refugee's welcome sign
384240	387600	doesn't mean that that sentiment is unique to women.
387600	389920	Secondly, just a minor pet peeve of mine,
389920	394800	but I hate that when people talk about immigrants disparagingly, they only ever say men.
394800	396800	You know, look at this clip.
396800	402000	There's men, there's women, there's children, there's all sorts of people.
402000	408240	And the United Nations data on Syrian refugees puts the gender split at around 50-50.
408240	411360	And of course, a large percentage of those are children.
411360	412960	It's hardly an army.
412960	417840	Black Pigeon's just only saying men because he thinks men are scarier, I guess.
417840	420480	And I'm specifically talking about Syria here,
420480	426960	because the image that Black Pigeon used was of free women welcoming Syrian refugees to Munich.
426960	431280	And here's a video of the event, and you can see the sign in the background there.
431280	440800	And look at this evil invading army of, like, regular families and children and elderly women.
440800	443680	It's hardly the Nazis coming over the hill.
443680	447680	Also, how do these women at all relate to the earlier point
447680	451840	about women seeking the favour of stronger and more dominant men?
451840	458160	You know, a refugee fleeing a failed state doesn't exactly scream dominant alpha male at me.
458160	464400	I guess I just don't really see the comparison between these women and prostitutes in occupied France.
464400	471040	The entire basis of Western society was the male agreement to keep only one woman in public,
471040	474720	so that every male has near equal chance at reproduction.
474720	479520	It's for this reason that organized and advanced civilizations have always needed to agree
479520	482000	on the equitable distribution of women,
482000	488160	so as to incentivize its men to produce and have a stake in the society's health and security.
488160	492320	But this, like other cultural arrangements that held the West together for centuries,
492320	496800	is breaking down, and can be observed in something as basic as the fact
496800	501280	there are no Western countries that are even at replacement levels in their birth rates.
502000	508320	This again can be laid at the feet of loosening of sexual morality and the dating habits of young women.
508320	513360	Now, I couldn't find exactly where Black Pigeon found this particular fertility rate graph,
513360	516480	but I saw the World Bank source down the bottom there,
516480	520160	so I went to the World Bank website and had a look at their data.
520800	523440	And they've got a neat little graph-making feature,
523440	529680	so I first recreated the graph in Black Pigeon's video using those countries and date ranges.
530400	534000	And as you can see, the graphs is the same.
534000	539040	So the first thing to note here is that the fall of the fertility rate since the 1960s
539040	541920	is not specific to Western countries.
541920	548240	If we add in the worldwide average, we can see that over the specified date range, that's falling too.
548240	553440	And the next thing to note is that the World Bank data only goes back to 1960,
553440	557760	which is just far enough to catch the post-World War II baby boom.
557760	561440	Now, I'm not gonna go into that much right now, but for those who don't know,
561440	566720	people tended to postpone starting families during World War II, if possible, you know?
566720	574000	The economy's terrible, the Nazis are invading, all the men are off fighting, it's a bad time to have kids.
574560	579040	But once the war's over, you know, everyone gets back to the baby-making.
579040	583920	Then once everyone who wants kids has had kids, there's generally a drop in the fertility rate
583920	589200	because the new generation that was born isn't old enough to have their own kids for a couple of decades.
590000	593760	And this is why you see the birth rate stabilize around 1980.
593760	598160	If we cut the boom out and only look at the data from 1980 onwards,
598160	604320	we see that the birth rates in those Western countries have actually been trending very slightly upwards.
604320	608480	And they're much closer today to the worldwide average, which is still falling.
609200	614080	Another point here is that by selecting certain countries and certain date ranges,
614080	616880	you can basically make whatever point you like.
616880	621040	And let's look at a few countries where the majority of people are Muslims and,
621040	625040	oh God, would you look at that? The birth rates are plummeting off a cliff.
625040	630160	Islam must be dying out pretty soon. There'll be no Muslims left at all.
630160	635360	Also, one thing to understand is that female psychology has always been about adaptation.
635360	640160	In our tribal past, if women of conquered tribes didn't submit to their new masters,
640160	644560	they faced death along with their husbands, brothers, sons, fathers.
645120	649360	Even today, many women seek out aggressive men, whether consciously or not,
649360	655280	as it seems that this psychology has been ground into women after countless years of our species' evolution.
656080	663200	That means criminals, gangsters, and mass murderers are always going to be more attractive to women than hard-working, honest men.
663200	665200	They always have been, they always will be.
665680	671360	Now, I won't deny that a certain number of people are attracted to that sort of notoriety,
671360	679200	but I guarantee if you ask the average woman if she'd rather marry an average, honest, hard-working guy,
679280	687520	or Charles fucking Manson, she's gonna pick the guy without the swastika tattoo on his forehead.
687520	694880	Black Pigeon is again viewing the actions of a very small minority of women as representative of all women.
694880	700320	Now, I don't have any studies for this on hand, but I did ask for women who I know personally
700320	705600	if they'd rather marry a completely average man or Charles Manson.
705600	708000	And they all said some variant of the sentence,
708640	711680	Why the fuck would I ever marry Charles Manson?
711680	717840	And that's anecdotal evidence, sure, but I'm willing to bet it generally holds true for most women.
717840	721920	The culture of the sensitive man, the emotional man, the compassionate man,
721920	726400	is at odds with what women are biologically predisposed to desire.
726960	731040	Young women, if they tell you the truth, are drawn to the scoundrel,
731040	734560	not the impeccable gentleman with the perfectly manicured fingernails.
735760	736960	I'm afraid.
736960	738560	You're trembling.
738560	740560	I'm not trembling.
742080	744800	You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
744800	747120	You're not a scoundrel in your life.
747120	749120	I happen to like nice men.
749120	751120	I'm a nice man.
751120	753120	Very nice.
754720	757520	Okay, that's a movie, dude.
757520	763600	You know, come on, don't cite a movie as your basis for claims about women's biological impulses.
763600	767440	But to laughingly take this somewhat seriously for a moment,
767440	770640	I'm gonna bet quite a lot of women's attraction to Han Solo
770640	774480	is mainly because he looks like Harrison Ford in the 80s.
775040	779040	You know, the Emperor is certainly more of a dominant alpha male than Han,
779040	782160	but I don't see many women pining after him, oddly enough.
782960	788640	However, we do all remember Leia's classic line after she meets Grand Moff Tarkin,
788640	789920	where she says,
806720	809840	So who knows, maybe Black Pigeon is onto something here.
810480	811760	Let's move on.
811760	814960	It's so much a part of women's psyche to want the scoundrel,
815520	817520	that it's wrapped up in their very DNA.
818640	822080	Just to get this out of the way, because I have a feeling it might show up in the comments,
822080	827360	yes, I am aware that the vast majority of women, when raped, reach sexual clim-
827360	831760	Whoa, uh, hang on, I'm not touching this bit, let's move further on.
831760	834560	Once women were given equal say in the sphere of politics,
834560	840640	it was only a matter of time until our civilization was swept up by the event horizon of its own collapse.
841280	843760	All kinds of studies have been done on this subject,
843760	848240	as this one from Columbia University, and they all, without exception,
848240	852480	note that as women become more quote-unquote emancipated,
852480	855120	the decline of the family is further accelerated.
855120	861120	And as the family disintegrates and women move politically further and further to the left in their voting,
861120	865440	many then begin to use the government as a surrogate husband and provider.
865440	871920	So here, Black Pigeon is arguing that women are moving further and further to the left in their voting.
871920	874400	But let's take a look at his sources here.
874400	879760	First, the study, uh, entitled, Why Have Women Become Left-Wing?
879760	885360	which is looking at the reasons that more women than men in the United States vote for the Democrats.
885360	891200	And in particular, it's looking at why the gender gap has been widening over the last few decades.
891200	897920	Now, if you just read the headline, you might get the sense that men occupy some sort of fixed political position,
897920	901760	and the gender gap is only caused by women moving to the left.
901760	905840	But if you read the study, it also mentions the inverse of that,
905840	910400	which is men moving further to the right to support the Republicans.
910400	914960	And this is something that Black Pigeon's next source goes into in more detail.
914960	920720	Uh, this headline, Why Do Women Vote Differently Than Men? is from Slate.com.
920720	924560	And this is some excellent tactical cropping from Black Pigeon here,
924560	929520	because if we scroll down just an inch, we can read the subheader.
929520	934720	Despite stereotypes, men are actually more fickle at the voting booth.
934720	937920	And this article argues that it's men moving to the right,
937920	942480	more so than women moving to the left, that is responsible for the gender gap.
942480	943680	And I quote,
943680	948000	So did women move away from Reagan and his party in disgust?
948000	955440	No. Rather, women's emerging belief in their own political entitlement permitted them to stay right where they were.
955440	962160	Reagan struck a chord with men, so men moved in a more Republican direction while women stayed put.
962160	969200	Kaufmann of the University of Maryland has looked at long-term election study data from 1952 to 2004
969200	973920	and observed that men's support for the Democratic Party declined from the mid-70s
973920	976640	through the eight years of Reagan's presidency,
976640	981120	and has remained at that lower level, with small fluctuations ever since.
981120	982960	In contrast, she writes,
988960	993760	And this isn't me going out and looking for some source to contradict Black Pigeon's claims here.
993760	996400	This article is in his video.
996400	998560	Well, the headline is, anyway.
998560	1000400	And let's look at the next headline.
1000400	1002560	Women Today Have a New Husband.
1002560	1006800	And this is from the website theprimalmale.com.
1006800	1009760	Uh, not a publication I'd heard of.
1009840	1014080	And what does this article have to say about women and the government?
1027600	1028560	Yikes.
1028560	1032240	And this website has some other interesting articles, like, uh,
1032240	1034320	Friendship with Women is Unnatural,
1035120	1037200	Modern Women's Contempt for Men,
1037840	1038560	uh,
1038560	1042000	what it feels like to be a nihilist, in which the author states,
1063360	1064240	Jeez.
1064320	1067520	It sounds like someone doesn't have any loyalty for his tribe.
1068240	1071280	Now then, apologies for the length of this next clip,
1071280	1075200	but it does represent the main source behind Black Pigeon's arguments,
1075200	1078000	so we're gonna have to watch all of it, I'm afraid.
1078000	1082080	In one of the most comprehensive studies of civilizational decline,
1082080	1086000	J.D. Unwin postulates in his book, Sex and Culture,
1086000	1087520	written in 1934,
1094800	1099440	Unwin, a British social anthropologist at Oxford and Cambridge universities,
1099440	1103360	studied 86 different cultures through 5,000 years of history,
1103360	1108480	and found a positive correlation between the cultural achievement of a people,
1108480	1111200	and the sexual restraint they observed.
1111200	1114560	Unwin's impetus for the project was to test the Freudian theory
1114560	1118800	that civilizational progress was the product of repressed sexuality.
1119520	1123280	He found that discipline in sexual matters appropriated social energy
1123280	1124800	to more civilizational ends.
1125520	1130240	It's very complicated, but for Unwin, the fabric of society was primarily sexual,
1130240	1134240	and heterosexual monogamy was the optimal arrangement for the planning,
1134240	1137120	building, protecting, and nurturing of the family.
1137120	1140560	If enough heterosexual partners made a monogamous commitment,
1140560	1143840	civilizational energy was directed toward promoting
1143840	1146560	the finest societal foundation possible.
1147360	1150960	Without exception, each civilization he studied allowed its success
1150960	1152880	to alter its moral code.
1152880	1156640	According to Unwin, after a nation becomes increasingly liberal
1156640	1158960	with regards to its sexual morality,
1158960	1163760	it loses its cohesion, its impetus, and its purpose.
1163760	1168560	From a chaste moral code, societies gain what he called expansive energy,
1168560	1172880	and this energy allowed these cultures to expand into other weaker cultures.
1173680	1176720	Okay, so let's talk about J.D. Unwin.
1177360	1180960	Now, when someone first recommended I make a video about Black Pigeon,
1180960	1185760	this Why Women Destroy Civilizations video was the first one I clicked on.
1185760	1187360	And before I watched it, I thought,
1187360	1189120	oh, well, this will be easy.
1189120	1192800	He'll obviously at some point list some example civilizations
1192800	1194720	that have been destroyed by women,
1194720	1196480	and then I can just counter those.
1196480	1200800	You know, for example, I imagined at some point Black Pigeon would say something like,
1200800	1203280	women's rights destroyed the Roman Empire,
1203280	1205440	and then I could just list off a bunch of reasons
1205440	1208000	that the Roman Empire actually collapsed
1208000	1212880	and make him seem foolish for oversimplifying it and pinning everything just on women.
1212880	1214880	So that was my plan going into this.
1215440	1217840	However, as you may have noticed by now,
1217840	1222320	Black Pigeon has not directly mentioned even one actual civilization
1222320	1224560	that's collapsed because of women's rights.
1224560	1227760	And nor does he ever, actually, in the entire video.
1227760	1230640	The only examples he gives are indirect.
1230640	1234640	He says that this J.D. Unwin guy found a bunch of civilizations
1234640	1236560	that were destroyed by women's rights.
1236560	1239360	So I thought, okay, new plan.
1239360	1241360	To get a concrete example here,
1241360	1245920	what I'm gonna have to do is go and read Sex and Culture by J.D. Unwin,
1245920	1251120	get to the bit where he says women's rights destroyed the Roman Empire or something like that,
1251120	1256000	and then I can counter that and, by proxy, prove Black Pigeon wrong.
1256560	1260080	So I went and read Sex and Culture by J.D. Unwin,
1260080	1264400	and as I read it, I realized I'd made two very amateur mistakes,
1264400	1266400	but we'll get back to those in a little while.
1267200	1270000	First, let's talk about Unwin's book.
1270000	1272320	Now, if you search online for J.D. Unwin,
1272320	1276320	you mainly only find him and his book mentioned in the same terms
1276320	1278480	that Black Pigeon is presenting it here.
1279040	1282320	Unwin seems to be quite popular in alt-right circles,
1282320	1286400	as someone who predicted that feminism will destroy the West.
1286400	1289120	But is that what his book actually says?
1289760	1291280	Well, let's take a look.
1291840	1295280	So, by and large, Black Pigeon does, initially,
1295280	1298880	give a fair representation of Unwin's general argument.
1298880	1302320	Unwin looked at a bunch of different cultures and civilizations
1302320	1304400	and sorted them into a hierarchy.
1304960	1308320	The exact specifics of which aren't terribly relevant for us right now,
1308320	1312080	but generally, the top of the scale represents more, quote,
1312080	1314640	advanced and civilized societies,
1314640	1318960	and the bottom of the scale, the less advanced and less civilized.
1319040	1322720	Now, what Unwin found was that societies nearer the top of his scale
1322720	1327280	tended to have more restrictive sexual norms than the societies lower on the scale.
1328080	1331120	Unwin also sees everything in terms of energy,
1331120	1335680	you know, expansive energy for a society to expand its territory,
1335680	1339600	creative energy to invent new things, and so on.
1339600	1342400	And he argues that societies further up the scale
1342400	1345840	have more energy than those lower on the scale.
1345840	1348240	And beyond just proving the correlation,
1348240	1351200	Unwin argues that the restricted sexual norms
1351200	1354560	are the cause of the increased societal energy,
1354560	1358400	and he thinks that if sexual relations are too easy to attain,
1358400	1361040	then a society will lose its energy.
1361040	1363120	I mean, basically, his argument is this.
1363760	1366320	Did you notice what went wrong in that scene?
1366320	1370000	Ordinarily, Billy would work hard to make money with his paper route.
1370000	1372720	Then he'd use the money to buy dinner for Mavis,
1372720	1376560	thus earning a slim chance to perform the reproductive act.
1376560	1380640	But in a world where teens can date robots, why should he bother?
1380640	1382400	Why should anyone bother?
1382400	1385040	Let's take a look at Billy's planet a year later.
1385680	1387680	Where are all the football stars?
1388240	1390400	And where are the biochemists?
1390400	1391440	They're trapped.
1391440	1394880	Trapped in the soft vice-like grip of robot lips.
1396800	1400480	All civilization was just an effort to impress the opposite sex.
1401360	1406400	With robots being a stand-in for easy access to sex there, I guess.
1406480	1410960	So there you go, you are now up to speed on J.D. Unwin's sex and culture.
1411520	1413840	So what do we think of his argument?
1413840	1416000	Well, just personally, I think that,
1416000	1420560	beyond being too quick to discard examples that go against his hypothesis,
1420560	1424560	Unwin generally proves the correlation between restricted sexual norms
1424560	1427680	and the advancement of civilization just fine.
1427680	1430400	But I'm not sold on it being causative.
1430400	1435040	In my opinion, for a society to actually be able to enforce sexual norms,
1435040	1438400	it generally has to have things like a strong government,
1438400	1441360	a legal system capable of imposing punishments,
1441920	1445680	usually a state religion to provide some religious justification.
1446320	1450080	And a society which has these things is typically gonna find itself
1450080	1452960	near at the top of Unwin's list anyway.
1452960	1456960	So I'd say restricted sexual norms just tend to go hand in hand
1456960	1461680	with the advancement of civilization rather than being the direct cause of it.
1461680	1464960	Now, I tend to agree with Aldous Huxley's view of Unwin.
1465120	1468000	Who thought sex and culture was a very significant work,
1468000	1471680	but that Unwin was guilty of oversimplification.
1471680	1474320	And this quote is taken from Huxley's introduction
1474320	1478320	to Unwin's posthumously published follow-up to sex and culture,
1478320	1479920	which we'll get to later.
1479920	1482720	This oversimplification is twofold.
1482720	1486160	There is what may be called the extensional oversimplification,
1486160	1488560	which consists in the omission to consider
1488560	1492080	all the significant factors existing at a given time.
1492080	1494560	And there is a temporal oversimplification,
1494560	1496560	which is the failure to take into account
1496560	1498720	the occasional and unpredictable emergence
1498720	1501200	into actuality of entirely new entities.
1502080	1502800	It's a mouthful.
1503360	1506480	Now, what Huxley's saying there, basically,
1506480	1508960	is Unwin misses a lot of shit out.
1508960	1511840	And he goes on to name a ton of things that represent
1511840	1515280	an equal or greater effect on a society's success
1515280	1518880	than the particular restrictiveness of its sexual norms.
1518880	1522240	You know, agricultural and technological advancement,
1522240	1527840	religion, nutrition, warfare, scientific discovery, diplomacy, and so on.
1528400	1533120	For Huxley, focusing too much on one specific societal element,
1533120	1536720	like Unwin does with sexual norms,
1536720	1539760	won't give you the full picture of how a society works.
1540320	1543920	And Huxley also raises another excellent point when he asks,
1544640	1548080	Do the conditions which make for a display of maximum energy
1548080	1552640	also and automatically make for a display of the best kind of energy?
1552640	1556080	Are the most energetic individuals and societies
1556080	1559760	necessarily the most kindly, forbearing, and peaceable?
1559760	1561440	And this is a very good question.
1561440	1566080	I mean, Nazi Germany certainly had a lot of expansive and creative energy.
1566080	1567760	No one can deny that.
1567760	1571840	It had so much expansive energy, in fact, that it got itself destroyed.
1572400	1574560	Now, before we get back to Black Pigeon,
1574560	1578000	I just want to make one more note about Unwin.
1578000	1583040	In Sex and Culture, he was approaching the issue strictly as a scientist.
1583040	1586400	For him, human civilizations are deterministic.
1587040	1592000	He makes no moral judgments, and aside from a few sentences in his conclusion,
1592000	1593920	he offers no political guidance.
1594560	1597760	In his later work, entitled Hyposia, however,
1597760	1601040	he creates an imaginary country called Hyposia,
1601040	1605280	which has all the elements which, for him, would allow the society
1605280	1609680	to be the most energetic and productive for the longest possible time.
1609680	1615600	So by reading that book, we can get a picture of exactly the sort of society that Unwin would want.
1616400	1618400	But we'll get back to that shortly.
1618400	1620800	For now, let's return to Black Pigeon.
1620800	1624000	Now, when you compare the modern Western world with the Islamic one,
1624000	1627280	you see exactly the results that Unwin's theory would predict.
1627840	1630000	By allowing women to fuck freely...
1630000	1634000	Whoa! The mask slipped a bit there, dude.
1634000	1637280	I don't think I can say the word fuck with that level of venom.
1638080	1640640	By allowing women to fuck freely...
1641840	1642340	Ugh!
1643440	1645520	By allowing women to fuck freely,
1645520	1650880	the West has de facto entered a matriarchy that disincentivizes young men.
1650880	1654080	Islam, on the other hand, keeps their women chaste,
1654080	1657280	and their expansive energy, as Unwin's theory predicts,
1657360	1660000	is manifested in what we're observing today.
1660000	1663280	The Islamic culture is the one who's expanding into the West.
1664000	1665760	Okay, so a brief point here.
1666560	1670160	Syrian refugees are some people fleeing a war zone.
1670160	1672320	They are not an organized army.
1672880	1677040	I can think of several instances, from my lifetime even,
1677040	1681920	when the West has been the invading armed force in a lot of Islamic countries.
1682560	1687600	I mean, in my lifetime, the United States actually invaded Iraq,
1688240	1690320	and took over the government.
1690320	1693840	But let's look at Unwin's hypothetical country of Hyposia,
1693840	1695760	and see how that would treat immigrants.
1696480	1702240	Another important part of a society's existence is its contact with other societies.
1702240	1707440	In a sluggish, uncivilized society, strangers are feared greatly.
1708000	1711600	Not because there is anything objectively fearsome about them,
1711600	1718080	but because they are strange, unusual beings who behave and speak in strange, unusual ways.
1718080	1723440	And this attitude toward strangers is also apparent among the less cultured members
1723440	1730080	of an energetic society, who will not have anything to do with a foreigner if they can help it.
1730080	1735600	Even in a rationalistic society, strangers are seldom treated in the same way as natives,
1735600	1741520	and in Hyposia, the duty of maintaining a sympathetic relation with other societies will
1742480	1744000	be allotted to special men.
1744560	1751840	You see, Unwin likes energy, and diversity of people, of thought, of whatever, for him is more energetic.
1752640	1758400	He doesn't want culture to stay the same. He wants it to change and adapt to new circumstances.
1759040	1763760	So enough about J.D. Unwin for now. Let's talk about Sweden.
1764480	1768560	The total and complete feminization of Sweden and its men
1768560	1772880	have allowed their women to invite their country's own destruction
1772880	1778240	through the importation of millions of unassimilatable and aggressive people
1778240	1781040	from completely alien cultures.
1781040	1784960	Not only are they borrowing money to fund the colonization of their country,
1784960	1788560	but they are now even creating gender imbalances
1788560	1793680	that will have severe and lasting repercussions on their society's future.
1793680	1797840	So something about that last source there seemed a little off to me.
1797840	1802640	You know, not only does it appear to have been written by someone called Fuzzy Slippers,
1803280	1805760	the claim seems a little suspect.
1805760	1809600	A worse gender imbalance than China? Really?
1809600	1811120	Well, let's investigate.
1811760	1817920	So this headline comes from a conservative website called LegalInsurrection.com,
1817920	1826160	and in it, Fuzzy Slippers is giving their interpretation of a January 2016 BBC story entitled
1826800	1830000	Why Does Sweden Have More Boys Than Girls?
1830000	1833680	So the first thing to note here is that the data in this news story
1833680	1837680	specifically looks at 16 and 17-year-olds,
1837680	1841840	which is, of course, not mentioned by BlackPigeon in his video.
1841840	1848720	Now then, normally, on average, there are 105 boys born for every 100 girls,
1848720	1854240	and in Sweden in 2014, there were 108 boys for every 100 girls.
1854800	1858400	So that's hardly that dramatic of a difference so far.
1858400	1865120	Now, in China, there are 117 boys to every 100 girls in that age range.
1865120	1867440	So what's going on here?
1867440	1872960	In just one year, how has the average number of boys in that age range in Sweden
1872960	1874400	jumped higher than China?
1875120	1879840	Or at least, how has it appeared to have jumped higher than China?
1879840	1882480	Well, if we look at this graph from the BBC article,
1882480	1887760	we see that the vast majority of asylum applicants are males in that age range.
1887760	1889680	So, why is that?
1889680	1892160	Well, according to this news story anyway,
1892160	1897760	it's to do with a particular right to family reunification that they have in Sweden.
1897760	1903200	It seems like if you apply for asylum in Sweden before you're 18 and you're successful,
1903760	1906880	you can then apply for family reunification,
1906880	1910080	and your family can get in on your residency permit.
1910800	1914400	Now, that's obviously quite an attractive prospect for a lot of people,
1914400	1919840	and it does explain why there's such a high number of male applicants in that age range.
1919840	1923760	I'm saying applicants because that's all they are at this point.
1923760	1926080	They've applied for asylum.
1926080	1930160	Now, the large gender imbalance cited by legalinsurrection.com
1930160	1935360	is from an estimate by Valerie Hudson of Texas A&M University,
1935360	1938160	and there's something very important to note here.
1938160	1940880	Her estimate was made under the assumption that
1940880	1946080	every single asylum applicant would be granted a residency permit,
1946080	1950080	which, to put it lightly, is not very realistic.
1950080	1955040	Although, I admit, I'm cheating a bit here by writing this ten months in the future,
1955040	1960160	where I know that Sweden rejected half of the asylum seekers who applied in 2015.
1960960	1963760	Hindsight is 2020, as they say.
1963760	1967440	The second thing to note here is that these 16 and 17-year-olds
1967440	1970720	were applying so disproportionately for asylum in Sweden
1971520	1976240	so that they could use the right to reunification to get their families in.
1976240	1979840	Now, I doubt that Black Pigeon would be too happy about that, to be honest,
1979840	1983520	but what it does mean is, even if they did all get in,
1983520	1986640	the gender imbalance stats no longer check out.
1986640	1990240	Because if a teenager is successful in his asylum application,
1990240	1995440	and then he invites his mum and his gran and auntie and three sisters over,
1995440	1997600	you know, the gender imbalance disappears.
1998160	2002320	Sweden does not have a gender imbalance worse than China.
2002880	2006400	There are more women than men in Sweden.
2006400	2008720	For this headline to make any sense at all,
2008720	2012720	you first have to only be talking about 16 and 17-year-olds,
2013440	2018240	then you have to assume that every single male applicant for asylum will get in,
2018960	2025040	and then you have to assume that they will not take advantage of the right to family reunification.
2025280	2028880	Which seems to be the reason they were applying there in the first place.
2029440	2033760	You know, I'm really glad I don't go in for all this anti-immigrant stuff myself.
2033760	2037040	I tie myself in knots trying to make it all make sense.
2037760	2044080	And they await their doom with smiles of tolerance and passivity, calm as Hindu cows.
2044640	2048720	Oh, fuck off with that Tyler Durden bullshit.
2048720	2052960	Looking again at Unwin's work, he leaves us with a stark dilemma.
2052960	2055360	It may not be possible to save the West.
2055360	2058720	According to his model, this process is irreversible,
2058720	2063760	and the only way to do so would be to restrict the sexual freedom of Western women
2063760	2066080	and move back to a more patriarchal society.
2067040	2071440	And here's where Black Pigeon really fucks it all up, good and proper.
2071440	2074880	He says that to save the West, according to Unwin's model,
2075520	2078640	we have to return to a patriarchal society.
2079360	2083120	So before we address this point, do you remember earlier when I said
2083120	2086560	I made two amateur mistakes before reading Unwin's book?
2087200	2088480	Well, here they are.
2088480	2094640	Firstly, I assumed that Black Pigeon was giving a fair representation of Unwin's work and opinions.
2095280	2100320	And secondly, I assumed that since this book is his primary source in the video,
2100880	2104400	that Black Pigeon had actually read the book.
2104960	2108640	So first off, let's take a look at the conclusion to Sex and Culture
2108640	2111680	and see what Unwin thinks about patriarchy.
2111680	2115520	It is difficult to express any opinion with complete confidence,
2115520	2119760	but as, at the end of my task, I look back along the stream of time,
2119760	2123040	it seems to me that it was the unequal fate of the women,
2123680	2129280	not the compulsory continent, that caused the downfall of absolute monogamy.
2129280	2150000	You see, Unwin sees a women's rights movement as a natural response
2150000	2153680	to a patriarchal society that is biased against women.
2153680	2157440	At no point does he argue for a return to a patriarchal system.
2158000	2163440	He traces the downfall of absolute monogamy to the unequal treatment of women.
2163440	2165520	And this is echoed in Hyposia,
2165520	2169840	which he thinks should have no legal differences between men and women.
2169840	2174400	The fundamental misunderstanding that Black Pigeon has with regards to Unwin's work
2174400	2179200	is that he appears to think that, when arguing for more restrictive sexual norms,
2179200	2181760	Unwin is talking specifically about women.
2182320	2185520	And that's not the case. He's talking about everyone.
2186080	2189040	A patriarchal society is bad for Unwin,
2189040	2192640	not just because it leads to a loss of societal energy,
2192640	2196400	but because it makes it too easy for men to get sex.
2196400	2202000	At one point, he cites the huge number of wives that a king has as a societal weakness.
2202720	2208320	And this brings up another point that's made clear by actually reading Unwin's work.
2208320	2212800	Unwin is talking mainly about the ruling class of a society.
2212800	2217840	He believes it's most important for rulers to be chaste and thus have a lot of energy.
2217840	2222160	And he thinks this attitude will filter down from the ruling class to the masses.
2222720	2226560	In Hyposia, he proposes two tiers of marriage.
2226560	2228560	Alpha and beta marriages.
2228560	2232080	Alpha marriages will be unbreakable and for life.
2232080	2235440	And there will be strict punishments for people who are unfaithful.
2236080	2240560	Beta marriages will be more akin to our idea of a modern marriage.
2240560	2243920	Less restrictive and with divorce a possibility.
2243920	2247360	Anyone in the society could enter either type of marriage,
2247360	2251840	but only people in alpha marriages could occupy positions of leadership.
2252480	2257120	This is because it was more important for Unwin for the leaders of a society
2257120	2260720	to be chaste than the average person in the street.
2260720	2263600	And speaking of that, to close this video out,
2263600	2268400	I'll just note here that Black Pigeon is a supporter of Donald Trump.
2268400	2273680	And as you're probably aware, a hot mic recording of Donald Trump was recently released
2273680	2279600	in which the married Donald Trump brags about cheating on his then-pregnant wife
2279600	2281760	with other people's wives.
2281760	2284880	And I wonder what JD Unwin would think about that.
2286240	2289120	Well done. You made it to the end of the video.
2289120	2293600	Congratulations. I realized this was a bit of a long one. I'm very sorry.
2294720	2297040	If you'd like to see more videos like this,
2297840	2298340	uh...
2300000	2303200	Everyone always says like and subscribe at the end of these things.
2304000	2307120	I don't understand why that is meant to help me.
2308000	2311280	I mean, it's always nice when people like and subscribe and stuff, but
2312560	2317120	what happens if more people click like versus just not clicking anything?
2318640	2323360	I'm genuinely asking someone right in the comments how that's meant to actually help me out.
2324160	2324660	Um...
2325200	2330480	We've also- we've got the- we've got Twitter, we've got Ask FM, um...
2332240	2333120	Goodbye.
