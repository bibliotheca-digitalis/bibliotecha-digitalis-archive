00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
Hello everyone. This is a video about group bias, that is the tendency of humans to form in-groups

00:06.800 --> 00:12.800
with people we assume to be like ourselves in some way, and out-groups of people we assume are different.

00:12.800 --> 00:18.600
It's also a video examining another video, one by YouTuber BlackPigeonSpeaks, titled

00:18.600 --> 00:23.600
Harvard Diversity Plus Proximity Equals Republican Voters.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.600
That's novel, eh? A video responding to another video.

00:27.800 --> 00:35.200
I predict that this response video, which I've just invented right now, will be the hot new trend of 2019.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.400
Right then, BlackPigeon's video.

00:37.400 --> 00:44.200
As always, I'd suggest that you go and watch that video first, and I'll include a link below for anyone inclined.

00:44.200 --> 00:49.200
However, for anyone who would not like to hear BlackPigeonSpeak, which is fair enough to be honest,

00:49.200 --> 00:51.600
I'll here summarize his argument.

00:51.600 --> 00:57.000
So, BlackPigeonSpeak starts out by recounting the so-called conventional wisdom that says

00:57.000 --> 01:03.400
demographic changes will make it harder, if not impossible, for Republicans to win elections in the United States,

01:03.400 --> 01:06.400
leading to Democratic control of government.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.800
However, do not fret, all you Republicans out there.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.600
BlackPigeon then introduces a study.

01:12.600 --> 01:17.800
Well, actually, before he gets to the study, he waffles about Bernie Sanders and AOC for a while,

01:17.800 --> 01:21.400
even though they have nothing to do with anything he's talking about, but

01:21.800 --> 01:24.800
whatever, we'll be charitable and not dwell on that.

01:24.800 --> 01:32.800
So, okay, he then introduces the study, which is causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes by Ryan D. Enos.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.000
BlackPigeon calls this a new study, but it isn't, really.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.800
It was released more than four years before BlackPigeon's video talking about it, but again, that's a nitpick.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.000
Now, BlackPigeon claims that the study shows that, quote,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
"...the liberal resolve of affluent Democrats can be completely and utterly dissolved

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
when racially or ethnically charged issues like neighborhood integration are at stake."

01:56.000 --> 02:02.800
He also introduces a book by the author of the study, that being The Space Between Us, published in 2017.

02:03.200 --> 02:09.200
As BlackPigeon is introducing this book, he shows a graphic of a hammer and sickle with an American flag pattern.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.000
And... why does he do this?

02:12.400 --> 02:17.400
I have no idea. Go and watch it. It's got nothing to do with anything he's talking about. It's great.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.800
Answers on a postcard, please.

02:20.200 --> 02:25.800
BlackPigeon is getting his information from both the study and the book from a New York Times article entitled

02:26.200 --> 02:31.200
How Much Can Democrats Count on Suburban Liberals? by Thomas B. Edsel.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.400
Now, reading out this article forms the basis of BlackPigeon's video script.

02:35.400 --> 02:40.400
He just changes the phrasing slightly here and there to make it slightly less obvious he's copying.

02:40.800 --> 02:45.600
So, let's quote this article directly now and find out about the study in question.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.600
And I quote,

02:46.600 --> 02:53.600
"...six years ago, Enos looked at nine townships southwest of Boston that were overwhelmingly racially and politically liberal.

02:53.600 --> 02:57.400
As such, these communities were a test of the power of demographic change,

02:57.400 --> 03:03.200
because these were people who we might think would be unlikely to change their attitudes in the face of immigration."

03:03.200 --> 03:09.200
And I disagree here. I'd say you can only trust a liberal as far as you can throw them, but that's just me.

03:09.200 --> 03:14.800
Enos and his colleagues conducted an experiment which is described in detail in a 2014 paper,

03:14.800 --> 03:20.800
Causal Effect of Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes, published by the National Academy of Sciences.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.800
The results are thought-provoking.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.800
Enos described the experiment as,

03:24.800 --> 03:29.800
"...a randomized controlled trial testing the causal effects of repeated intergroup contact

03:29.800 --> 03:33.800
in which Spanish-speaking Confederates were randomly assigned to be inserted

03:33.800 --> 03:41.600
for a period of days into the daily routines of unknowing Anglo-Whites living in homogenous communities in the United States,

03:41.600 --> 03:44.800
thus simulating the conditions of demographic change.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.600
Under the assumption that people with similar characteristics tend to ride the train at the same time,

03:49.600 --> 03:54.200
I selected pairs of trains that were close together in time so that the treatment units

03:54.200 --> 03:57.900
—train platforms onto which Spanish-speaking Confederates had been inserted—

03:57.900 --> 04:00.400
within each station would have similar passengers.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.600
Within a matched pair of train times at each station,

04:03.600 --> 04:10.000
one was randomly assigned to treatment and one to control, resulting in 18 matched pairs of train times.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.800
This design means that we should expect subjects in the treatment and control conditions to be, in expectation, identical.

04:16.800 --> 04:23.200
Subjects were exposed to the same Spanish-speaking persons in a location near their homes for an extended period,

04:23.200 --> 04:29.600
as would be the situation if immigrants had moved into their neighborhood and used the public transportation.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.400
And what were the results?

04:31.400 --> 04:38.000
Well, members of the treatment groups and control groups were surveyed before and after the two-week-long experiments

04:38.000 --> 04:42.200
in an effort to identify the effect of exposure to Spanish-speaking people.

04:42.200 --> 04:48.600
In both surveys, respondents were asked free questions about immigration along with other more general questions.

04:48.600 --> 04:53.800
Treated subjects were far more likely to advocate a reduction in immigration from Mexico

04:53.800 --> 04:59.400
and were far less likely to indicate that illegal immigrants should be allowed to remain in the country.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.000
So that seems fairly open and shut there.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.800
White liberals who were exposed to contact with Spanish-speaking people on their morning train rides

05:06.800 --> 05:11.000
were more likely to support a reduction in immigration than those who weren't,

05:11.000 --> 05:18.400
or diversity plus proximity equals Republican voters, as Black Pigeon Speaks puts it in his video title.

05:18.400 --> 05:24.000
So what do we think about his video? Why was it made and what points was it trying to make?

05:24.000 --> 05:29.200
Well, my impression was that the primary reason it was made was to allay the fears of right-wingers

05:29.200 --> 05:35.600
about their exclusionary politics leading to future electoral losses as demographics change over time.

05:35.600 --> 05:40.600
As we know, white voters in the States lean Republican, but why is that?

05:40.600 --> 05:45.800
Well, I won't go into it too much right now, but a part of the story is that for decades,

05:45.800 --> 05:53.000
the electoral strategy of the Republicans has been to exploit and deepen racial polarization and use racism,

05:53.200 --> 05:56.400
particularly racism against African Americans,

05:56.400 --> 06:03.400
and more recently, racism against immigrants coming across the southern border to get white voters to the polls.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.200
And this isn't some conspiracy theory of mine.

06:06.200 --> 06:12.400
If you didn't already know that for whatever reason, I'd advise that you go and read about the southern strategy.

06:12.400 --> 06:15.000
All this stuff is quite out in the open.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.600
Now, the problem with relying on the white vote, however, is that the white vote is shrinking.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.400
Not, I should say, because the number of white people is shrinking,

06:24.400 --> 06:27.400
if you're the sort of person who cares about that sort of thing,

06:27.400 --> 06:31.200
because it isn't. The number of white people is increasing.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.200
But the white vote as a percentage of the whole is shrinking,

06:35.200 --> 06:39.000
and those people who are being demonized by the Republican Party

06:39.000 --> 06:43.800
aren't too likely to be keen on voting for them in the near future, anyway.

06:43.800 --> 06:51.800
The Republican strategists basically traded short-term electoral victories for long-term demographic catastrophe.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.400
Is the worry among a lot of racists out there, anyway.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.800
So, here to address this worry is Black Pigeon Speaks,

06:58.800 --> 07:03.400
who has found a study that apparently shows white liberals will become Republicans

07:03.400 --> 07:06.600
as they're exposed to the effects of immigration,

07:06.600 --> 07:12.400
thus avoiding the coming Democratic-Communist supermajority, or whatever it's supposed to be.

07:12.400 --> 07:18.000
Now, I should add here that I don't believe in the coming Democratic-Communist supermajority.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
As nice as that sounds.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Under capitalism, there's a lot of pressure and incentive for things to happen a certain way.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.200
And if I had to guess, I'd say if the Republicans did prove completely unable to get elected,

07:30.200 --> 07:34.600
those same things would still happen, but via the Democrats instead.

07:34.600 --> 07:40.000
Wealth will find a conduit to power as long as one exists, so they say.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.600
But that's all besides the point, I suppose.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.400
Now, there's a couple of problems with the narrative presented by Black Pigeon, aren't there?

07:47.400 --> 07:53.200
Firstly, if coming into contact with diversity is supposed to make white people into Republicans,

07:53.200 --> 07:57.200
then we'd expect that white people inhabiting large, diverse cities

07:57.200 --> 08:02.600
would be more likely to vote Republican than rural white people in white communities,

08:02.600 --> 08:05.800
who rarely come into contact with diversity.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.200
And that's not the case.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.600
You know, from that perspective, we could argue that living in diverse areas

08:10.600 --> 08:14.600
means one is more likely to be a Democrat, not a Republican.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.400
So, oh no, a contradiction.

08:17.400 --> 08:22.800
How are we gonna resolve these apparently conflicting results of exposure to diversity?

08:22.800 --> 08:27.400
Well, I was curious about this, so I went and read the study mentioned in the article,

08:27.400 --> 08:33.800
and also ordered and read the book by the author of the study, The Space Between Us, which was very interesting.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.600
Here's a picture of my copy of the book with my very helpful research assistant there.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.600
Now, folks, would you believe it if I told you that Black Pigeon Speaks

08:42.600 --> 08:46.600
wasn't completely honest about the results of the train study?

08:48.200 --> 08:50.600
That's a brief pause for gasps there.

08:50.600 --> 08:55.000
A crucial part of the story has been left out, and it's this.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
The train study actually had two different time controls,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.800
and I'll quote here from a section of the book entitled

09:01.800 --> 09:04.600
What is the effect of repeat contact?

09:31.800 --> 09:36.600
policies, but less so than the group that had been surveyed after three days.

09:36.600 --> 09:41.800
This shows that the initial urge to keep out a group of people after seeing them may have softened.

09:41.800 --> 09:46.200
In the waning days of the experiment, our Confederates themselves reported things

09:46.200 --> 09:48.800
that made it sound as if people were coming around to them.

09:48.800 --> 09:53.200
For example, people have started to recognize us and smile to us.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.600
They mentioned that a passenger who spoke to them said,

09:55.600 --> 10:01.200
The longer you see the same person every day, the more confident you feel to greet and say hi to them.

10:01.200 --> 10:07.200
These interactions suggest something about the effects of contact on the group-based bias caused by social geography.

10:07.200 --> 10:12.200
Namely, that the initial exclusionary reaction has diminished with contact.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.600
It's possible that given enough time, say a month or a year,

10:15.600 --> 10:20.200
the aversion would wear off and my Confederates would be welcomed into the community.

10:20.200 --> 10:24.400
As I address in chapter 9, perhaps this ameliorating effect of contact

10:24.400 --> 10:29.000
is what we have seen in some areas of the United States, such as California,

10:29.000 --> 10:34.400
where the vir... virulent... virulent... I always struggle with that...

10:34.400 --> 10:40.400
where the virulent anti-immigrant politics of the 1990s gave way to an embrace of immigrants.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.400
Perhaps Arizona or Boston, when the time comes,

10:43.400 --> 10:48.400
will move along this arc of intergroup interactions from clash to indifference."

10:48.400 --> 10:50.600
End quote. So there we go, folks.

10:50.600 --> 10:55.400
An initial exclusionary reaction that diminishes with repeat contact.

10:55.400 --> 10:59.800
That is what the author of the study says that the results of the study suggest.

10:59.800 --> 11:04.200
Now, Black Pigeon Speaks completely avoids mentioning the diminished reaction

11:04.200 --> 11:07.200
among the group being surveyed over the longer time period,

11:07.200 --> 11:10.600
and as such, misrepresents the findings of the study.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.800
It's classic cherry-picking there.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.600
Now then, it would be very easy to just leave off here,

11:15.600 --> 11:20.000
you know, giving the impression that this initial shock leading to integration outcome

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
is the natural and inevitable result of two different groups meeting.

11:24.200 --> 11:28.000
And while that is often the case, sometimes it is not.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.200
And the integration can happen at varying rates, depending on various factors.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.400
So as tempting as it would be to simply point out the lie in Black Pigeon's video

11:37.400 --> 11:40.600
and then swish my cape and vanish into the night,

11:40.600 --> 11:43.000
I think there's a fair bit more to say here.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Although, I'm no expert here, by the way.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I've read one book about it, this one.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.200
But this is YouTube, so, you know, Land of the Blind and all that.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.800
So then, when I was reading The Space Between Us,

11:55.800 --> 11:59.600
I was surprised to encounter an idea that I'd never heard before,

11:59.600 --> 12:03.000
but that seems relatively obvious after I'd read it.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.600
An area can be very racially diverse, but also still heavily segregated.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.000
Now, the book includes this map of Chicago as an example,

12:12.000 --> 12:13.800
and also includes this other map,

12:13.800 --> 12:18.400
which is a random reordering of the population of Chicago as a comparison there.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.200
So even if someone lives in a city that is very diverse on paper,

12:22.200 --> 12:27.000
they might inhabit a section of the city, a neighborhood or suburb, for example,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
that is not diverse at all.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.400
People don't experience the entirety of whatever city they live in, do they?

12:33.400 --> 12:37.200
You know, they live and work in only a small part of it, usually.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.400
So what's the significance of that?

12:39.400 --> 12:41.200
Well, understanding all that,

12:41.200 --> 12:45.000
it's not really as much of a shock as Black Pigeon makes it out to be

12:45.000 --> 12:48.200
that white liberals living in a mostly white area

12:48.200 --> 12:51.800
would react with shock when exposed to an outgroup.

12:51.800 --> 12:56.400
You know, frankly, I consider it more of a shock that they started to get over it in only two weeks,

12:56.400 --> 12:58.200
but that's just me.

12:58.200 --> 13:02.600
And I'd like to consider the impulse to point to this study as if to say,

13:02.600 --> 13:06.000
aha, see? Group bias does exist.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.600
This is a line of argument I see racists try to take occasionally.

13:10.600 --> 13:16.800
Racism is just another term for a natural and logical ingroup preference, they say.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.600
Now, to that, I would argue that the human tendency to form ingroups

13:20.600 --> 13:24.600
and prefer them to outgroups does not justify racial bias.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.800
It actually undermines it.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.000
And you're gonna have to stick with me here.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.600
First, consider the Spanish-speaking people that were part of the train study.

13:33.600 --> 13:37.200
Some of the white people who used the same stations and trains as those people

13:37.200 --> 13:40.200
showed an increased bias against immigrants.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.200
However, and I think this is rather important,

13:43.200 --> 13:47.000
those Spanish-speaking people weren't doing anything wrong.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
They were just riding the trains around the same as the other passengers.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.600
You know, could we argue that the heightened group bias of the white passengers

13:55.600 --> 14:01.000
was therefore illogical because it was being triggered by completely innocuous behavior?

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Now, the obvious response to that line of thinking is that

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
even though those particular Spanish-speaking people on the trains weren't doing anything wrong,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.400
their presence could have conjured in the minds of the white passengers

14:12.400 --> 14:16.200
various negative things associated with immigrants,

14:16.200 --> 14:20.000
say, crime, gangs, drugs, and whatever else.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.400
For an example of the sorts of negative things one might hear about immigrants into the United States,

14:25.400 --> 14:29.600
let's hear from Black Pigeon Speaks, and this is from his video titled

14:29.600 --> 14:33.000
The Amerimex Future of the United States.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
"-The browning of America and the reduction of whites to a minority status,

14:37.000 --> 14:42.200
as we are told by elected officials, academia, and most importantly, the media,

14:42.200 --> 14:44.000
is a cause to celebrate.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.800
When the U.S. demographically resembles Mexico, Brazil, or Colombia,

14:47.800 --> 14:54.400
it can finally enjoy a utopian future that is promised by those that preach social justice.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.400
America assimilated the Irish and the Italians,

14:57.400 --> 15:02.400
so becoming a majority brown nation will be just the same and nothing will change.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.800
The only problem is, according to many, including Samuel P. Huntington,

15:06.800 --> 15:10.000
Mexicans and other Latinos are not assimilating.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.800
They are, in fact, forming their own cultural, political, and linguistic enclaves across the country.

15:15.800 --> 15:22.800
From Los Angeles to Miami, Latinos are rejecting the Anglo-Protestant values that built America.

15:22.800 --> 15:31.000
Entire swaths of the population now have divided loyalties, dual nationalities, and transnational identities.

15:31.000 --> 15:38.200
And this is cause for concern for the future cultural and even territorial integrity of the United States.

15:38.400 --> 15:43.400
The greatest risk and largest challenge for the U.S. and its traditional identity

15:43.400 --> 15:47.600
is from the massive, never-ending tidal wave of people

15:47.600 --> 15:52.200
washing into the country from Latin America, and specifically, Mexico.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.600
So that's the same old shit, really.

15:54.600 --> 16:01.000
They're coming over here, they're not integrating, not learning the language, outbreeding us, and so on.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.600
I particularly like the discarded doll's head with the worm in the eye socket there.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.600
That's, uh, very subtle imagery.

16:09.200 --> 16:14.600
So, anyway, someone might argue that there's enough negative press about immigrants out there

16:14.600 --> 16:20.800
that we can't fairly dismiss the bias being shown in the train experiment as entirely illogical.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.800
So what we really need here is another experiment,

16:23.800 --> 16:31.400
one that tests whether this group bias exists for groups about which people cannot possibly have any prior preconceptions.

16:31.400 --> 16:36.600
And would you believe it, such a study was described in detail, in the space between us.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.000
And I'll quote here from the section, Creating a Neighborhood.

17:01.400 --> 17:08.000
But this perceptual type had actually already been randomly assigned by us prior to the beginning of the experiment.

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
We called these perceptual types Type H and Type Y, and those were our minimal groups.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.400
Our intention was that the subjects would see the perceptual type to which they were assigned as their ingroup,

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
and the other as the outgroup.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.600
Of course, we never told them these distinctions were important.

17:24.600 --> 17:29.200
Rather, we just let the power of categorization take over to affect behavior.

17:29.200 --> 17:34.800
We then manipulated spatial geography so that the distorting power of groups was amplified.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.600
After we had administered the test of perceptual type,

17:37.600 --> 17:41.200
the research assistants brought all the subjects into a waiting room,

17:41.200 --> 17:45.200
telling them that the lecture hall had to be prepared for the next experiment.

17:45.200 --> 17:50.600
It was in this waiting room that we created our neighborhood, segregated or integrated,

17:50.600 --> 17:54.800
and thus the experimental treatment of segregation was administered.

17:54.800 --> 18:02.400
In one condition, randomly assigned, the subjects would be segregated with members of each perceptual type on different sides of the room.

18:02.400 --> 18:08.000
In the other condition, they would be integrated, randomly with respect to perceptual type, across the room.

18:08.000 --> 18:15.400
The room had rows of chairs, so it really did look like a waiting room you might see at the dentist's office or at the Department of Motor Vehicles.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.600
On the desks, we placed folders with further instructions.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.400
Each folder was assigned to one of the participants,

18:21.400 --> 18:25.600
which allowed us to unobtrusively arrange them to sit in certain locations.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.200
The folders came in two colors, representing the two perceptual types,

18:29.200 --> 18:33.400
so that the participants could see whether all the type Hs sat on one side of the room,

18:33.400 --> 18:36.800
and all the type Ys on the other, or whether they were integrated.

18:36.800 --> 18:41.200
The subjects were asked to wait there for five minutes without speaking or using their phones.

18:41.200 --> 18:46.400
After five minutes, we sent each subject to a separate room for data collection.

18:46.400 --> 18:52.200
The separate rooms were important because we wanted to ensure that the subjects answered our questions in private,

18:52.200 --> 18:55.600
so as not to be biased by social desirability.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.600
In the rooms, they answered two sets of questions on the laptop we provided.

18:59.600 --> 19:04.600
Their perceptions of directly observable physical attributes of the two groups,

19:04.600 --> 19:08.200
and their perceptions of social attributes of the two groups.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.800
They were asked to give their best guesses about the levels of these attributes.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.200
The physical attributes were height, weight, and age.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.000
The social attributes were income and politics.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
How liberal or conservative was the average member of each group?

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
After the participants reported their answers, the experiment was over.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.400
We repeated this entire process until we had tested over 200 subjects in total.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.000
The results of this unusual experiment?

19:33.000 --> 19:38.800
After only five minutes of sitting in a certain spatial arrangement with groups that were completely fabricated,

19:38.800 --> 19:44.400
our subjects thought that the heights, weights, and ages of people in their in-group were more similar to their own

19:44.400 --> 19:48.600
than the heights, weights, and ages of people in their out-group were to their own.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.400
They also thought that the people in their in-group were more socially similar to them

19:52.400 --> 19:56.400
in terms of politics and income than people in the out-group were.

19:56.400 --> 20:02.400
As other researchers have found, the simple act of categorizing had collapsed the difference within groups

20:02.400 --> 20:05.200
and increased the difference across groups.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.600
But here's the key.

20:06.600 --> 20:12.600
This perceived difference between the out-group and in-group was even larger when the groups were segregated

20:12.600 --> 20:15.000
than it was when they were integrated.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Think of it.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
Five minutes of segregation was enough to change people's perceptions about other human beings.

20:22.000 --> 20:30.600
So we see from that experiment that group-based biases exist even for completely fabricated and randomly assigned categories

20:30.600 --> 20:32.400
that people just heard about.

20:32.400 --> 20:38.000
Now, other prior studies have shown this before, but the twist that The Space Between Us introduces

20:38.000 --> 20:43.600
is the extra test for the effect of segregation upon the extent of these group biases.

20:43.600 --> 20:48.800
If you're segregated from the out-group, you're more likely to exhibit this bias.

20:48.800 --> 20:55.200
For example, if you're a white person living in a white suburb, well, you get the picture.

20:55.200 --> 21:01.200
What this book makes clear over and over again is that these biases are not exclusively racial.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.800
You know, they can be geographical, religious.

21:04.800 --> 21:10.400
Think about the changing importance of which Christian denomination people say they follow, for instance.

21:10.400 --> 21:15.000
And in one interesting chapter in the book, group experiments are carried out in Jerusalem.

21:15.000 --> 21:22.600
Now, I was expecting, as you might, that those group experiments would be testing relations between Israel and Palestine.

21:22.600 --> 21:29.200
But no, the book instead concerns itself with the divisions between non-religious or moderately religious Jews

21:29.200 --> 21:32.200
and what are described as ultra-orthodox Jews.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.400
And, of course, those same group divisions were found.

21:35.400 --> 21:42.200
This is why I believe the human tendency to form in-groups actually undermines the legitimacy of racial bias,

21:42.200 --> 21:50.400
because we do the exact same thing even if we're randomly sorted into meaningless groups like H and Y, for example.

21:50.400 --> 21:55.000
The Space Between Us is concerned with how we can create harmonious societies

21:55.000 --> 22:00.600
while acknowledging that people form illogical groups and have illogical biases.

22:00.600 --> 22:06.200
You can call those biases natural, but what does natural mean there?

22:06.200 --> 22:12.000
You know, living naked in the woods is natural in one regard, and most of us don't do that.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.600
Is that unnatural? Are hospitals natural? I don't know.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.600
You know, if the human tendency to form illogical biases is natural,

22:21.600 --> 22:27.800
then I propose that the human ability to recognize and overcome those biases is also natural.

22:27.800 --> 22:34.400
You know, we needn't submit to irrationality just because we imagine it to be closer to a natural state of being.

22:34.400 --> 22:39.800
Now, it's about time for me to wrap up here, but I'd like to return to BlackPigeonSpeaks for a moment.

22:39.800 --> 22:46.400
I've avoided talking about the end of his video so far, but I think I should address it before I go.

22:46.400 --> 22:50.400
I showed a clip of BlackPigeon a little while ago from a different video

22:50.400 --> 22:57.000
bemoaning how Mexican immigrants into the United States aren't integrating, aren't learning the language, and so on.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.600
And to quote him there,

22:58.600 --> 23:03.800
"...the greatest risk and largest challenge for the U.S. and its traditional identity

23:03.800 --> 23:10.200
is from the massive, never-ending tidal wave of people washing into the country from Latin America."

23:10.200 --> 23:14.100
Now, with that quote in mind, let's watch a clip from the end of his

23:14.100 --> 23:18.800
Diversity Plus Proximity Equals Republican Voters video.

23:18.900 --> 23:24.200
Something else to consider when thinking of those that prognosticate a blue America

23:24.200 --> 23:29.600
is that Latino Americans are increasingly identifying themselves as white.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.300
Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses,

23:33.300 --> 23:39.100
about 7% of Hispanics changed their self-description from some other race to white.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.500
At the same time, according to the Census Bureau,

23:41.500 --> 23:46.000
three-fourths of white population growth in 21st century America

23:46.000 --> 23:52.100
has been driven by individuals who declared themselves white and of Hispanic origin.

23:52.100 --> 23:59.800
If increasing numbers of Hispanics identify as white and their descendants are defined as white in government statistics,

23:59.800 --> 24:05.600
there may be a white majority in the U.S. throughout the 21st century.

24:05.600 --> 24:10.000
It is also possible that as Latinos assimilate and intermarry,

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
they will move from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party,

24:14.000 --> 24:19.300
following a trailblazed in the past by many white ethnic voters of European descent,

24:19.300 --> 24:22.700
including Irish Americans and Italian Americans.

24:22.700 --> 24:25.400
Now then, you might be wondering,

24:25.400 --> 24:27.300
what the fuck?

24:27.300 --> 24:30.800
You know, what are immigrants to Black Pigeon Speaks?

24:30.800 --> 24:36.200
One minute, they're a vast horde of barbarians flowing across the border and taking over,

24:36.200 --> 24:43.600
and the next minute, they're all assimilating and intermarrying and voting Republican and identifying as white.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.200
How can they be both?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.600
You know, are they gonna integrate or not?

24:47.600 --> 24:53.900
It seems like Black Pigeon Speaks' answer is dependent upon the particular argument he's having at the time.

24:53.900 --> 25:00.500
It seems like as long as you're owning the libs, you can basically swap out any of your beliefs on the fly.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.200
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.200
Some news.

25:04.200 --> 25:08.700
We're coming up on 200,000 subscribers over here at...

25:08.700 --> 25:10.000
Sean.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.200
I never could think of a good name.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.900
How exciting, though.

25:13.900 --> 25:18.000
All of you should do me a favor and tell a friend about the channel,

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
and then we'll hit 400,000 subscribers.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.800
Do that, in fact, please.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.700
I wanna catch Hbomb up,

25:26.700 --> 25:30.600
and it doesn't look like it's happening by itself anytime soon, unfortunately,

25:30.600 --> 25:33.000
so I'm gonna have to resort to begging.

25:33.200 --> 25:37.200
Thanks, as always, to all of my patrons over on Patreon.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.600
I'm gonna go with Patreon today.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.600
There was a bit of a credit kerfuffle last video.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.800
Hopefully, everything is sorted this time.

25:44.800 --> 25:49.000
If not, let me know, and I'll fix it eventually.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.100
I'll put links to my Twitter and Curious Cat accounts below

25:52.100 --> 25:55.000
if you'd like to give me a follow or ask me a question.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
I'll also include a link to our Twitch channel.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.100
I get quite a lot of messages on Twitch expressing surprise that I'm on there,

26:02.100 --> 26:04.300
so I thought I'd mention it here.

26:04.300 --> 26:11.100
Me and Jen and Pete stream on Twitch on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays,

26:11.100 --> 26:13.100
and sometimes other days, too.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.100
So, there you go. Now you know.

26:15.100 --> 26:18.100
Okay, folks, that's it from me. I'll see you next time.
