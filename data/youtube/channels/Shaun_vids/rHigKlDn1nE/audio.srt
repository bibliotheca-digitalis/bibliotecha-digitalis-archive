00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Hello everyone. This is a video about group bias, that is the tendency of humans to form in-groups

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,800
with people we assume to be like ourselves in some way, and out-groups of people we assume are different.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,600
It's also a video examining another video, one by YouTuber BlackPigeonSpeaks, titled

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Harvard Diversity Plus Proximity Equals Republican Voters.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,600
That's novel, eh? A video responding to another video.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:35,200
I predict that this response video, which I've just invented right now, will be the hot new trend of 2019.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,400
Right then, BlackPigeon's video.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,200
As always, I'd suggest that you go and watch that video first, and I'll include a link below for anyone inclined.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,200
However, for anyone who would not like to hear BlackPigeonSpeak, which is fair enough to be honest,

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
I'll here summarize his argument.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,000
So, BlackPigeonSpeak starts out by recounting the so-called conventional wisdom that says

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,400
demographic changes will make it harder, if not impossible, for Republicans to win elections in the United States,

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,400
leading to Democratic control of government.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,800
However, do not fret, all you Republicans out there.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,600
BlackPigeon then introduces a study.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,800
Well, actually, before he gets to the study, he waffles about Bernie Sanders and AOC for a while,

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,400
even though they have nothing to do with anything he's talking about, but

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,800
whatever, we'll be charitable and not dwell on that.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:32,800
So, okay, he then introduces the study, which is causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes by Ryan D. Enos.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
BlackPigeon calls this a new study, but it isn't, really.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,800
It was released more than four years before BlackPigeon's video talking about it, but again, that's a nitpick.

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Now, BlackPigeon claims that the study shows that, quote,

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
"...the liberal resolve of affluent Democrats can be completely and utterly dissolved

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
when racially or ethnically charged issues like neighborhood integration are at stake."

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,800
He also introduces a book by the author of the study, that being The Space Between Us, published in 2017.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,200
As BlackPigeon is introducing this book, he shows a graphic of a hammer and sickle with an American flag pattern.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,000
And... why does he do this?

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,400
I have no idea. Go and watch it. It's got nothing to do with anything he's talking about. It's great.

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
Answers on a postcard, please.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,800
BlackPigeon is getting his information from both the study and the book from a New York Times article entitled

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,200
How Much Can Democrats Count on Suburban Liberals? by Thomas B. Edsel.

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Now, reading out this article forms the basis of BlackPigeon's video script.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,400
He just changes the phrasing slightly here and there to make it slightly less obvious he's copying.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,600
So, let's quote this article directly now and find out about the study in question.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
And I quote,

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,600
"...six years ago, Enos looked at nine townships southwest of Boston that were overwhelmingly racially and politically liberal.

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,400
As such, these communities were a test of the power of demographic change,

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,200
because these were people who we might think would be unlikely to change their attitudes in the face of immigration."

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,200
And I disagree here. I'd say you can only trust a liberal as far as you can throw them, but that's just me.

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,800
Enos and his colleagues conducted an experiment which is described in detail in a 2014 paper,

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Causal Effect of Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes, published by the National Academy of Sciences.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
The results are thought-provoking.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Enos described the experiment as,

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,800
"...a randomized controlled trial testing the causal effects of repeated intergroup contact

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
in which Spanish-speaking Confederates were randomly assigned to be inserted

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,600
for a period of days into the daily routines of unknowing Anglo-Whites living in homogenous communities in the United States,

47
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,800
thus simulating the conditions of demographic change.

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,600
Under the assumption that people with similar characteristics tend to ride the train at the same time,

49
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,200
I selected pairs of trains that were close together in time so that the treatment units

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,900
—train platforms onto which Spanish-speaking Confederates had been inserted—

51
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,400
within each station would have similar passengers.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,600
Within a matched pair of train times at each station,

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,000
one was randomly assigned to treatment and one to control, resulting in 18 matched pairs of train times.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,800
This design means that we should expect subjects in the treatment and control conditions to be, in expectation, identical.

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Subjects were exposed to the same Spanish-speaking persons in a location near their homes for an extended period,

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,600
as would be the situation if immigrants had moved into their neighborhood and used the public transportation.

57
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,400
And what were the results?

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, members of the treatment groups and control groups were surveyed before and after the two-week-long experiments

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,200
in an effort to identify the effect of exposure to Spanish-speaking people.

60
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:48,600
In both surveys, respondents were asked free questions about immigration along with other more general questions.

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Treated subjects were far more likely to advocate a reduction in immigration from Mexico

62
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,400
and were far less likely to indicate that illegal immigrants should be allowed to remain in the country.

63
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,000
So that seems fairly open and shut there.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
White liberals who were exposed to contact with Spanish-speaking people on their morning train rides

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,000
were more likely to support a reduction in immigration than those who weren't,

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,400
or diversity plus proximity equals Republican voters, as Black Pigeon Speaks puts it in his video title.

67
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,000
So what do we think about his video? Why was it made and what points was it trying to make?

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Well, my impression was that the primary reason it was made was to allay the fears of right-wingers

69
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,600
about their exclusionary politics leading to future electoral losses as demographics change over time.

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,600
As we know, white voters in the States lean Republican, but why is that?

71
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,800
Well, I won't go into it too much right now, but a part of the story is that for decades,

72
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,000
the electoral strategy of the Republicans has been to exploit and deepen racial polarization and use racism,

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,400
particularly racism against African Americans,

74
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,400
and more recently, racism against immigrants coming across the southern border to get white voters to the polls.

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,200
And this isn't some conspiracy theory of mine.

76
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,400
If you didn't already know that for whatever reason, I'd advise that you go and read about the southern strategy.

77
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,000
All this stuff is quite out in the open.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,600
Now, the problem with relying on the white vote, however, is that the white vote is shrinking.

79
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,400
Not, I should say, because the number of white people is shrinking,

80
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,400
if you're the sort of person who cares about that sort of thing,

81
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,200
because it isn't. The number of white people is increasing.

82
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,200
But the white vote as a percentage of the whole is shrinking,

83
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,000
and those people who are being demonized by the Republican Party

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,800
aren't too likely to be keen on voting for them in the near future, anyway.

85
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:51,800
The Republican strategists basically traded short-term electoral victories for long-term demographic catastrophe.

86
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,400
Is the worry among a lot of racists out there, anyway.

87
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,800
So, here to address this worry is Black Pigeon Speaks,

88
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,400
who has found a study that apparently shows white liberals will become Republicans

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,600
as they're exposed to the effects of immigration,

90
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,400
thus avoiding the coming Democratic-Communist supermajority, or whatever it's supposed to be.

91
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,000
Now, I should add here that I don't believe in the coming Democratic-Communist supermajority.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
As nice as that sounds.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Under capitalism, there's a lot of pressure and incentive for things to happen a certain way.

94
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,200
And if I had to guess, I'd say if the Republicans did prove completely unable to get elected,

95
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,600
those same things would still happen, but via the Democrats instead.

96
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Wealth will find a conduit to power as long as one exists, so they say.

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,600
But that's all besides the point, I suppose.

98
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Now, there's a couple of problems with the narrative presented by Black Pigeon, aren't there?

99
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,200
Firstly, if coming into contact with diversity is supposed to make white people into Republicans,

100
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,200
then we'd expect that white people inhabiting large, diverse cities

101
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,600
would be more likely to vote Republican than rural white people in white communities,

102
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,800
who rarely come into contact with diversity.

103
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
And that's not the case.

104
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,600
You know, from that perspective, we could argue that living in diverse areas

105
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
means one is more likely to be a Democrat, not a Republican.

106
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,400
So, oh no, a contradiction.

107
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,800
How are we gonna resolve these apparently conflicting results of exposure to diversity?

108
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Well, I was curious about this, so I went and read the study mentioned in the article,

109
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,800
and also ordered and read the book by the author of the study, The Space Between Us, which was very interesting.

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,600
Here's a picture of my copy of the book with my very helpful research assistant there.

111
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Now, folks, would you believe it if I told you that Black Pigeon Speaks

112
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
wasn't completely honest about the results of the train study?

113
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,600
That's a brief pause for gasps there.

114
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,000
A crucial part of the story has been left out, and it's this.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The train study actually had two different time controls,

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,800
and I'll quote here from a section of the book entitled

117
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,600
What is the effect of repeat contact?

118
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,600
policies, but less so than the group that had been surveyed after three days.

119
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,800
This shows that the initial urge to keep out a group of people after seeing them may have softened.

120
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,200
In the waning days of the experiment, our Confederates themselves reported things

121
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,800
that made it sound as if people were coming around to them.

122
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,200
For example, people have started to recognize us and smile to us.

123
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
They mentioned that a passenger who spoke to them said,

124
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,200
The longer you see the same person every day, the more confident you feel to greet and say hi to them.

125
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,200
These interactions suggest something about the effects of contact on the group-based bias caused by social geography.

126
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Namely, that the initial exclusionary reaction has diminished with contact.

127
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,600
It's possible that given enough time, say a month or a year,

128
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,200
the aversion would wear off and my Confederates would be welcomed into the community.

129
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,400
As I address in chapter 9, perhaps this ameliorating effect of contact

130
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,000
is what we have seen in some areas of the United States, such as California,

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,400
where the vir... virulent... virulent... I always struggle with that...

132
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,400
where the virulent anti-immigrant politics of the 1990s gave way to an embrace of immigrants.

133
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Perhaps Arizona or Boston, when the time comes,

134
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,400
will move along this arc of intergroup interactions from clash to indifference."

135
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,600
End quote. So there we go, folks.

136
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,400
An initial exclusionary reaction that diminishes with repeat contact.

137
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,800
That is what the author of the study says that the results of the study suggest.

138
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,200
Now, Black Pigeon Speaks completely avoids mentioning the diminished reaction

139
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
among the group being surveyed over the longer time period,

140
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,600
and as such, misrepresents the findings of the study.

141
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,800
It's classic cherry-picking there.

142
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
Now then, it would be very easy to just leave off here,

143
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
you know, giving the impression that this initial shock leading to integration outcome

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is the natural and inevitable result of two different groups meeting.

145
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,000
And while that is often the case, sometimes it is not.

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,200
And the integration can happen at varying rates, depending on various factors.

147
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,400
So as tempting as it would be to simply point out the lie in Black Pigeon's video

148
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,600
and then swish my cape and vanish into the night,

149
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,000
I think there's a fair bit more to say here.

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Although, I'm no expert here, by the way.

151
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I've read one book about it, this one.

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,200
But this is YouTube, so, you know, Land of the Blind and all that.

153
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,800
So then, when I was reading The Space Between Us,

154
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,600
I was surprised to encounter an idea that I'd never heard before,

155
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,000
but that seems relatively obvious after I'd read it.

156
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,600
An area can be very racially diverse, but also still heavily segregated.

157
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,000
Now, the book includes this map of Chicago as an example,

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,800
and also includes this other map,

159
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,400
which is a random reordering of the population of Chicago as a comparison there.

160
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,200
So even if someone lives in a city that is very diverse on paper,

161
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,000
they might inhabit a section of the city, a neighborhood or suburb, for example,

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
that is not diverse at all.

163
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,400
People don't experience the entirety of whatever city they live in, do they?

164
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,200
You know, they live and work in only a small part of it, usually.

165
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,400
So what's the significance of that?

166
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,200
Well, understanding all that,

167
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,000
it's not really as much of a shock as Black Pigeon makes it out to be

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,200
that white liberals living in a mostly white area

169
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,800
would react with shock when exposed to an outgroup.

170
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,400
You know, frankly, I consider it more of a shock that they started to get over it in only two weeks,

171
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
but that's just me.

172
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,600
And I'd like to consider the impulse to point to this study as if to say,

173
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,000
aha, see? Group bias does exist.

174
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,600
This is a line of argument I see racists try to take occasionally.

175
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,800
Racism is just another term for a natural and logical ingroup preference, they say.

176
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,600
Now, to that, I would argue that the human tendency to form ingroups

177
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,600
and prefer them to outgroups does not justify racial bias.

178
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,800
It actually undermines it.

179
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,000
And you're gonna have to stick with me here.

180
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,600
First, consider the Spanish-speaking people that were part of the train study.

181
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
Some of the white people who used the same stations and trains as those people

182
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
showed an increased bias against immigrants.

183
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
However, and I think this is rather important,

184
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,000
those Spanish-speaking people weren't doing anything wrong.

185
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
They were just riding the trains around the same as the other passengers.

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,600
You know, could we argue that the heightened group bias of the white passengers

187
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,000
was therefore illogical because it was being triggered by completely innocuous behavior?

188
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Now, the obvious response to that line of thinking is that

189
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
even though those particular Spanish-speaking people on the trains weren't doing anything wrong,

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,400
their presence could have conjured in the minds of the white passengers

191
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,200
various negative things associated with immigrants,

192
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,000
say, crime, gangs, drugs, and whatever else.

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,400
For an example of the sorts of negative things one might hear about immigrants into the United States,

194
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,600
let's hear from Black Pigeon Speaks, and this is from his video titled

195
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,000
The Amerimex Future of the United States.

196
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
"-The browning of America and the reduction of whites to a minority status,

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,200
as we are told by elected officials, academia, and most importantly, the media,

198
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
is a cause to celebrate.

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,800
When the U.S. demographically resembles Mexico, Brazil, or Colombia,

200
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,400
it can finally enjoy a utopian future that is promised by those that preach social justice.

201
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
America assimilated the Irish and the Italians,

202
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,400
so becoming a majority brown nation will be just the same and nothing will change.

203
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,800
The only problem is, according to many, including Samuel P. Huntington,

204
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,000
Mexicans and other Latinos are not assimilating.

205
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,800
They are, in fact, forming their own cultural, political, and linguistic enclaves across the country.

206
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,800
From Los Angeles to Miami, Latinos are rejecting the Anglo-Protestant values that built America.

207
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:31,000
Entire swaths of the population now have divided loyalties, dual nationalities, and transnational identities.

208
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,200
And this is cause for concern for the future cultural and even territorial integrity of the United States.

209
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,400
The greatest risk and largest challenge for the U.S. and its traditional identity

210
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,600
is from the massive, never-ending tidal wave of people

211
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,200
washing into the country from Latin America, and specifically, Mexico.

212
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,600
So that's the same old shit, really.

213
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,000
They're coming over here, they're not integrating, not learning the language, outbreeding us, and so on.

214
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,600
I particularly like the discarded doll's head with the worm in the eye socket there.

215
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
That's, uh, very subtle imagery.

216
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,600
So, anyway, someone might argue that there's enough negative press about immigrants out there

217
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,800
that we can't fairly dismiss the bias being shown in the train experiment as entirely illogical.

218
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
So what we really need here is another experiment,

219
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:31,400
one that tests whether this group bias exists for groups about which people cannot possibly have any prior preconceptions.

220
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,600
And would you believe it, such a study was described in detail, in the space between us.

221
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,000
And I'll quote here from the section, Creating a Neighborhood.

222
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,000
But this perceptual type had actually already been randomly assigned by us prior to the beginning of the experiment.

223
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We called these perceptual types Type H and Type Y, and those were our minimal groups.

224
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,400
Our intention was that the subjects would see the perceptual type to which they were assigned as their ingroup,

225
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
and the other as the outgroup.

226
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,600
Of course, we never told them these distinctions were important.

227
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,200
Rather, we just let the power of categorization take over to affect behavior.

228
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,800
We then manipulated spatial geography so that the distorting power of groups was amplified.

229
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,600
After we had administered the test of perceptual type,

230
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,200
the research assistants brought all the subjects into a waiting room,

231
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,200
telling them that the lecture hall had to be prepared for the next experiment.

232
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,600
It was in this waiting room that we created our neighborhood, segregated or integrated,

233
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,800
and thus the experimental treatment of segregation was administered.

234
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:02,400
In one condition, randomly assigned, the subjects would be segregated with members of each perceptual type on different sides of the room.

235
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,000
In the other condition, they would be integrated, randomly with respect to perceptual type, across the room.

236
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,400
The room had rows of chairs, so it really did look like a waiting room you might see at the dentist's office or at the Department of Motor Vehicles.

237
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,600
On the desks, we placed folders with further instructions.

238
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,400
Each folder was assigned to one of the participants,

239
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,600
which allowed us to unobtrusively arrange them to sit in certain locations.

240
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
The folders came in two colors, representing the two perceptual types,

241
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,400
so that the participants could see whether all the type Hs sat on one side of the room,

242
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,800
and all the type Ys on the other, or whether they were integrated.

243
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,200
The subjects were asked to wait there for five minutes without speaking or using their phones.

244
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,400
After five minutes, we sent each subject to a separate room for data collection.

245
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,200
The separate rooms were important because we wanted to ensure that the subjects answered our questions in private,

246
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,600
so as not to be biased by social desirability.

247
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,600
In the rooms, they answered two sets of questions on the laptop we provided.

248
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Their perceptions of directly observable physical attributes of the two groups,

249
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,200
and their perceptions of social attributes of the two groups.

250
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,800
They were asked to give their best guesses about the levels of these attributes.

251
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,200
The physical attributes were height, weight, and age.

252
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,000
The social attributes were income and politics.

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How liberal or conservative was the average member of each group?

254
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
After the participants reported their answers, the experiment was over.

255
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,400
We repeated this entire process until we had tested over 200 subjects in total.

256
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,000
The results of this unusual experiment?

257
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,800
After only five minutes of sitting in a certain spatial arrangement with groups that were completely fabricated,

258
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,400
our subjects thought that the heights, weights, and ages of people in their in-group were more similar to their own

259
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,600
than the heights, weights, and ages of people in their out-group were to their own.

260
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,400
They also thought that the people in their in-group were more socially similar to them

261
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
in terms of politics and income than people in the out-group were.

262
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,400
As other researchers have found, the simple act of categorizing had collapsed the difference within groups

263
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,200
and increased the difference across groups.

264
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
But here's the key.

265
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,600
This perceived difference between the out-group and in-group was even larger when the groups were segregated

266
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,000
than it was when they were integrated.

267
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Think of it.

268
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Five minutes of segregation was enough to change people's perceptions about other human beings.

269
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,600
So we see from that experiment that group-based biases exist even for completely fabricated and randomly assigned categories

270
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,400
that people just heard about.

271
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,000
Now, other prior studies have shown this before, but the twist that The Space Between Us introduces

272
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,600
is the extra test for the effect of segregation upon the extent of these group biases.

273
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,800
If you're segregated from the out-group, you're more likely to exhibit this bias.

274
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,200
For example, if you're a white person living in a white suburb, well, you get the picture.

275
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,200
What this book makes clear over and over again is that these biases are not exclusively racial.

276
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,800
You know, they can be geographical, religious.

277
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,400
Think about the changing importance of which Christian denomination people say they follow, for instance.

278
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,000
And in one interesting chapter in the book, group experiments are carried out in Jerusalem.

279
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Now, I was expecting, as you might, that those group experiments would be testing relations between Israel and Palestine.

280
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:29,200
But no, the book instead concerns itself with the divisions between non-religious or moderately religious Jews

281
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,200
and what are described as ultra-orthodox Jews.

282
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,400
And, of course, those same group divisions were found.

283
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:42,200
This is why I believe the human tendency to form in-groups actually undermines the legitimacy of racial bias,

284
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:50,400
because we do the exact same thing even if we're randomly sorted into meaningless groups like H and Y, for example.

285
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,000
The Space Between Us is concerned with how we can create harmonious societies

286
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,600
while acknowledging that people form illogical groups and have illogical biases.

287
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,200
You can call those biases natural, but what does natural mean there?

288
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,000
You know, living naked in the woods is natural in one regard, and most of us don't do that.

289
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,600
Is that unnatural? Are hospitals natural? I don't know.

290
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,600
You know, if the human tendency to form illogical biases is natural,

291
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,800
then I propose that the human ability to recognize and overcome those biases is also natural.

292
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:34,400
You know, we needn't submit to irrationality just because we imagine it to be closer to a natural state of being.

293
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Now, it's about time for me to wrap up here, but I'd like to return to BlackPigeonSpeaks for a moment.

294
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:46,400
I've avoided talking about the end of his video so far, but I think I should address it before I go.

295
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I showed a clip of BlackPigeon a little while ago from a different video

296
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,000
bemoaning how Mexican immigrants into the United States aren't integrating, aren't learning the language, and so on.

297
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,600
And to quote him there,

298
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,800
"...the greatest risk and largest challenge for the U.S. and its traditional identity

299
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:10,200
is from the massive, never-ending tidal wave of people washing into the country from Latin America."

300
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,100
Now, with that quote in mind, let's watch a clip from the end of his

301
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,800
Diversity Plus Proximity Equals Republican Voters video.

302
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,200
Something else to consider when thinking of those that prognosticate a blue America

303
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,600
is that Latino Americans are increasingly identifying themselves as white.

304
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,300
Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses,

305
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,100
about 7% of Hispanics changed their self-description from some other race to white.

306
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,500
At the same time, according to the Census Bureau,

307
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,000
three-fourths of white population growth in 21st century America

308
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,100
has been driven by individuals who declared themselves white and of Hispanic origin.

309
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:59,800
If increasing numbers of Hispanics identify as white and their descendants are defined as white in government statistics,

310
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,600
there may be a white majority in the U.S. throughout the 21st century.

311
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
It is also possible that as Latinos assimilate and intermarry,

312
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
they will move from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party,

313
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,300
following a trailblazed in the past by many white ethnic voters of European descent,

314
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,700
including Irish Americans and Italian Americans.

315
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,400
Now then, you might be wondering,

316
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,300
what the fuck?

317
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,800
You know, what are immigrants to Black Pigeon Speaks?

318
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,200
One minute, they're a vast horde of barbarians flowing across the border and taking over,

319
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:43,600
and the next minute, they're all assimilating and intermarrying and voting Republican and identifying as white.

320
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
How can they be both?

321
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,600
You know, are they gonna integrate or not?

322
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,900
It seems like Black Pigeon Speaks' answer is dependent upon the particular argument he's having at the time.

323
00:24:53,900 --> 00:25:00,500
It seems like as long as you're owning the libs, you can basically swap out any of your beliefs on the fly.

324
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,200
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

325
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,200
Some news.

326
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,700
We're coming up on 200,000 subscribers over here at...

327
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,000
Sean.

328
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,200
I never could think of a good name.

329
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,900
How exciting, though.

330
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,000
All of you should do me a favor and tell a friend about the channel,

331
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and then we'll hit 400,000 subscribers.

332
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,800
Do that, in fact, please.

333
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,700
I wanna catch Hbomb up,

334
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,600
and it doesn't look like it's happening by itself anytime soon, unfortunately,

335
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,000
so I'm gonna have to resort to begging.

336
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Thanks, as always, to all of my patrons over on Patreon.

337
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm gonna go with Patreon today.

338
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,600
There was a bit of a credit kerfuffle last video.

339
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,800
Hopefully, everything is sorted this time.

340
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,000
If not, let me know, and I'll fix it eventually.

341
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,100
I'll put links to my Twitter and Curious Cat accounts below

342
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,000
if you'd like to give me a follow or ask me a question.

343
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'll also include a link to our Twitch channel.

344
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,100
I get quite a lot of messages on Twitch expressing surprise that I'm on there,

345
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,300
so I thought I'd mention it here.

346
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:11,100
Me and Jen and Pete stream on Twitch on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays,

347
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
and sometimes other days, too.

348
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
So, there you go. Now you know.

349
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Okay, folks, that's it from me. I'll see you next time.
