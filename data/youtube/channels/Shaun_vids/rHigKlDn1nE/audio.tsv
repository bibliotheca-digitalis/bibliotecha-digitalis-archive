0	6800	Hello everyone. This is a video about group bias, that is the tendency of humans to form in-groups
6800	12800	with people we assume to be like ourselves in some way, and out-groups of people we assume are different.
12800	18600	It's also a video examining another video, one by YouTuber BlackPigeonSpeaks, titled
18600	23600	Harvard Diversity Plus Proximity Equals Republican Voters.
23600	27600	That's novel, eh? A video responding to another video.
27800	35200	I predict that this response video, which I've just invented right now, will be the hot new trend of 2019.
35200	37400	Right then, BlackPigeon's video.
37400	44200	As always, I'd suggest that you go and watch that video first, and I'll include a link below for anyone inclined.
44200	49200	However, for anyone who would not like to hear BlackPigeonSpeak, which is fair enough to be honest,
49200	51600	I'll here summarize his argument.
51600	57000	So, BlackPigeonSpeak starts out by recounting the so-called conventional wisdom that says
57000	63400	demographic changes will make it harder, if not impossible, for Republicans to win elections in the United States,
63400	66400	leading to Democratic control of government.
66400	69800	However, do not fret, all you Republicans out there.
69800	72600	BlackPigeon then introduces a study.
72600	77800	Well, actually, before he gets to the study, he waffles about Bernie Sanders and AOC for a while,
77800	81400	even though they have nothing to do with anything he's talking about, but
81800	84800	whatever, we'll be charitable and not dwell on that.
84800	92800	So, okay, he then introduces the study, which is causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes by Ryan D. Enos.
93200	96000	BlackPigeon calls this a new study, but it isn't, really.
96000	102800	It was released more than four years before BlackPigeon's video talking about it, but again, that's a nitpick.
102800	106000	Now, BlackPigeon claims that the study shows that, quote,
106000	111000	"...the liberal resolve of affluent Democrats can be completely and utterly dissolved
111000	116000	when racially or ethnically charged issues like neighborhood integration are at stake."
116000	122800	He also introduces a book by the author of the study, that being The Space Between Us, published in 2017.
123200	129200	As BlackPigeon is introducing this book, he shows a graphic of a hammer and sickle with an American flag pattern.
129600	132000	And... why does he do this?
132400	137400	I have no idea. Go and watch it. It's got nothing to do with anything he's talking about. It's great.
138200	139800	Answers on a postcard, please.
140200	145800	BlackPigeon is getting his information from both the study and the book from a New York Times article entitled
146200	151200	How Much Can Democrats Count on Suburban Liberals? by Thomas B. Edsel.
151400	155400	Now, reading out this article forms the basis of BlackPigeon's video script.
155400	160400	He just changes the phrasing slightly here and there to make it slightly less obvious he's copying.
160800	165600	So, let's quote this article directly now and find out about the study in question.
165600	166600	And I quote,
166600	173600	"...six years ago, Enos looked at nine townships southwest of Boston that were overwhelmingly racially and politically liberal.
173600	177400	As such, these communities were a test of the power of demographic change,
177400	183200	because these were people who we might think would be unlikely to change their attitudes in the face of immigration."
183200	189200	And I disagree here. I'd say you can only trust a liberal as far as you can throw them, but that's just me.
189200	194800	Enos and his colleagues conducted an experiment which is described in detail in a 2014 paper,
194800	200800	Causal Effect of Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes, published by the National Academy of Sciences.
200800	202800	The results are thought-provoking.
202800	204800	Enos described the experiment as,
204800	209800	"...a randomized controlled trial testing the causal effects of repeated intergroup contact
209800	213800	in which Spanish-speaking Confederates were randomly assigned to be inserted
213800	221600	for a period of days into the daily routines of unknowing Anglo-Whites living in homogenous communities in the United States,
221600	224800	thus simulating the conditions of demographic change.
224800	229600	Under the assumption that people with similar characteristics tend to ride the train at the same time,
229600	234200	I selected pairs of trains that were close together in time so that the treatment units
234200	237900	—train platforms onto which Spanish-speaking Confederates had been inserted—
237900	240400	within each station would have similar passengers.
240400	243600	Within a matched pair of train times at each station,
243600	250000	one was randomly assigned to treatment and one to control, resulting in 18 matched pairs of train times.
250000	256800	This design means that we should expect subjects in the treatment and control conditions to be, in expectation, identical.
256800	263200	Subjects were exposed to the same Spanish-speaking persons in a location near their homes for an extended period,
263200	269600	as would be the situation if immigrants had moved into their neighborhood and used the public transportation.
269600	271400	And what were the results?
271400	278000	Well, members of the treatment groups and control groups were surveyed before and after the two-week-long experiments
278000	282200	in an effort to identify the effect of exposure to Spanish-speaking people.
282200	288600	In both surveys, respondents were asked free questions about immigration along with other more general questions.
288600	293800	Treated subjects were far more likely to advocate a reduction in immigration from Mexico
293800	299400	and were far less likely to indicate that illegal immigrants should be allowed to remain in the country.
299400	302000	So that seems fairly open and shut there.
302000	306800	White liberals who were exposed to contact with Spanish-speaking people on their morning train rides
306800	311000	were more likely to support a reduction in immigration than those who weren't,
311000	318400	or diversity plus proximity equals Republican voters, as Black Pigeon Speaks puts it in his video title.
318400	324000	So what do we think about his video? Why was it made and what points was it trying to make?
324000	329200	Well, my impression was that the primary reason it was made was to allay the fears of right-wingers
329200	335600	about their exclusionary politics leading to future electoral losses as demographics change over time.
335600	340600	As we know, white voters in the States lean Republican, but why is that?
340600	345800	Well, I won't go into it too much right now, but a part of the story is that for decades,
345800	353000	the electoral strategy of the Republicans has been to exploit and deepen racial polarization and use racism,
353200	356400	particularly racism against African Americans,
356400	363400	and more recently, racism against immigrants coming across the southern border to get white voters to the polls.
363400	366200	And this isn't some conspiracy theory of mine.
366200	372400	If you didn't already know that for whatever reason, I'd advise that you go and read about the southern strategy.
372400	375000	All this stuff is quite out in the open.
375000	380600	Now, the problem with relying on the white vote, however, is that the white vote is shrinking.
380600	384400	Not, I should say, because the number of white people is shrinking,
384400	387400	if you're the sort of person who cares about that sort of thing,
387400	391200	because it isn't. The number of white people is increasing.
391200	395200	But the white vote as a percentage of the whole is shrinking,
395200	399000	and those people who are being demonized by the Republican Party
399000	403800	aren't too likely to be keen on voting for them in the near future, anyway.
403800	411800	The Republican strategists basically traded short-term electoral victories for long-term demographic catastrophe.
411800	415400	Is the worry among a lot of racists out there, anyway.
415400	418800	So, here to address this worry is Black Pigeon Speaks,
418800	423400	who has found a study that apparently shows white liberals will become Republicans
423400	426600	as they're exposed to the effects of immigration,
426600	432400	thus avoiding the coming Democratic-Communist supermajority, or whatever it's supposed to be.
432400	438000	Now, I should add here that I don't believe in the coming Democratic-Communist supermajority.
438000	440000	As nice as that sounds.
440000	445000	Under capitalism, there's a lot of pressure and incentive for things to happen a certain way.
445000	450200	And if I had to guess, I'd say if the Republicans did prove completely unable to get elected,
450200	454600	those same things would still happen, but via the Democrats instead.
454600	460000	Wealth will find a conduit to power as long as one exists, so they say.
460000	462600	But that's all besides the point, I suppose.
462600	467400	Now, there's a couple of problems with the narrative presented by Black Pigeon, aren't there?
467400	473200	Firstly, if coming into contact with diversity is supposed to make white people into Republicans,
473200	477200	then we'd expect that white people inhabiting large, diverse cities
477200	482600	would be more likely to vote Republican than rural white people in white communities,
482600	485800	who rarely come into contact with diversity.
485800	487200	And that's not the case.
487200	490600	You know, from that perspective, we could argue that living in diverse areas
490600	494600	means one is more likely to be a Democrat, not a Republican.
494600	497400	So, oh no, a contradiction.
497400	502800	How are we gonna resolve these apparently conflicting results of exposure to diversity?
502800	507400	Well, I was curious about this, so I went and read the study mentioned in the article,
507400	513800	and also ordered and read the book by the author of the study, The Space Between Us, which was very interesting.
514000	518600	Here's a picture of my copy of the book with my very helpful research assistant there.
518600	522600	Now, folks, would you believe it if I told you that Black Pigeon Speaks
522600	526600	wasn't completely honest about the results of the train study?
528200	530600	That's a brief pause for gasps there.
530600	535000	A crucial part of the story has been left out, and it's this.
535000	539000	The train study actually had two different time controls,
539000	541800	and I'll quote here from a section of the book entitled
541800	544600	What is the effect of repeat contact?
571800	576600	policies, but less so than the group that had been surveyed after three days.
576600	581800	This shows that the initial urge to keep out a group of people after seeing them may have softened.
581800	586200	In the waning days of the experiment, our Confederates themselves reported things
586200	588800	that made it sound as if people were coming around to them.
588800	593200	For example, people have started to recognize us and smile to us.
593200	595600	They mentioned that a passenger who spoke to them said,
595600	601200	The longer you see the same person every day, the more confident you feel to greet and say hi to them.
601200	607200	These interactions suggest something about the effects of contact on the group-based bias caused by social geography.
607200	612200	Namely, that the initial exclusionary reaction has diminished with contact.
612200	615600	It's possible that given enough time, say a month or a year,
615600	620200	the aversion would wear off and my Confederates would be welcomed into the community.
620200	624400	As I address in chapter 9, perhaps this ameliorating effect of contact
624400	629000	is what we have seen in some areas of the United States, such as California,
629000	634400	where the vir... virulent... virulent... I always struggle with that...
634400	640400	where the virulent anti-immigrant politics of the 1990s gave way to an embrace of immigrants.
640400	643400	Perhaps Arizona or Boston, when the time comes,
643400	648400	will move along this arc of intergroup interactions from clash to indifference."
648400	650600	End quote. So there we go, folks.
650600	655400	An initial exclusionary reaction that diminishes with repeat contact.
655400	659800	That is what the author of the study says that the results of the study suggest.
659800	664200	Now, Black Pigeon Speaks completely avoids mentioning the diminished reaction
664200	667200	among the group being surveyed over the longer time period,
667200	670600	and as such, misrepresents the findings of the study.
670600	672800	It's classic cherry-picking there.
672800	675600	Now then, it would be very easy to just leave off here,
675600	680000	you know, giving the impression that this initial shock leading to integration outcome
680000	684000	is the natural and inevitable result of two different groups meeting.
684200	688000	And while that is often the case, sometimes it is not.
688000	693200	And the integration can happen at varying rates, depending on various factors.
693200	697400	So as tempting as it would be to simply point out the lie in Black Pigeon's video
697400	700600	and then swish my cape and vanish into the night,
700600	703000	I think there's a fair bit more to say here.
703000	706000	Although, I'm no expert here, by the way.
706000	709000	I've read one book about it, this one.
709000	713200	But this is YouTube, so, you know, Land of the Blind and all that.
713200	715800	So then, when I was reading The Space Between Us,
715800	719600	I was surprised to encounter an idea that I'd never heard before,
719600	723000	but that seems relatively obvious after I'd read it.
723000	728600	An area can be very racially diverse, but also still heavily segregated.
728600	732000	Now, the book includes this map of Chicago as an example,
732000	733800	and also includes this other map,
733800	738400	which is a random reordering of the population of Chicago as a comparison there.
738400	742200	So even if someone lives in a city that is very diverse on paper,
742200	747000	they might inhabit a section of the city, a neighborhood or suburb, for example,
747000	749000	that is not diverse at all.
749000	753400	People don't experience the entirety of whatever city they live in, do they?
753400	757200	You know, they live and work in only a small part of it, usually.
757200	759400	So what's the significance of that?
759400	761200	Well, understanding all that,
761200	765000	it's not really as much of a shock as Black Pigeon makes it out to be
765000	768200	that white liberals living in a mostly white area
768200	771800	would react with shock when exposed to an outgroup.
771800	776400	You know, frankly, I consider it more of a shock that they started to get over it in only two weeks,
776400	778200	but that's just me.
778200	782600	And I'd like to consider the impulse to point to this study as if to say,
782600	786000	aha, see? Group bias does exist.
786000	790600	This is a line of argument I see racists try to take occasionally.
790600	796800	Racism is just another term for a natural and logical ingroup preference, they say.
796800	800600	Now, to that, I would argue that the human tendency to form ingroups
800600	804600	and prefer them to outgroups does not justify racial bias.
804600	806800	It actually undermines it.
806800	809000	And you're gonna have to stick with me here.
809000	813600	First, consider the Spanish-speaking people that were part of the train study.
813600	817200	Some of the white people who used the same stations and trains as those people
817200	820200	showed an increased bias against immigrants.
820200	823200	However, and I think this is rather important,
823200	827000	those Spanish-speaking people weren't doing anything wrong.
827000	831000	They were just riding the trains around the same as the other passengers.
831000	835600	You know, could we argue that the heightened group bias of the white passengers
835600	841000	was therefore illogical because it was being triggered by completely innocuous behavior?
841000	844000	Now, the obvious response to that line of thinking is that
844000	849000	even though those particular Spanish-speaking people on the trains weren't doing anything wrong,
849000	852400	their presence could have conjured in the minds of the white passengers
852400	856200	various negative things associated with immigrants,
856200	860000	say, crime, gangs, drugs, and whatever else.
860000	865400	For an example of the sorts of negative things one might hear about immigrants into the United States,
865400	869600	let's hear from Black Pigeon Speaks, and this is from his video titled
869600	873000	The Amerimex Future of the United States.
873000	877000	"-The browning of America and the reduction of whites to a minority status,
877000	882200	as we are told by elected officials, academia, and most importantly, the media,
882200	884000	is a cause to celebrate.
884000	887800	When the U.S. demographically resembles Mexico, Brazil, or Colombia,
887800	894400	it can finally enjoy a utopian future that is promised by those that preach social justice.
894400	897400	America assimilated the Irish and the Italians,
897400	902400	so becoming a majority brown nation will be just the same and nothing will change.
902400	906800	The only problem is, according to many, including Samuel P. Huntington,
906800	910000	Mexicans and other Latinos are not assimilating.
910000	915800	They are, in fact, forming their own cultural, political, and linguistic enclaves across the country.
915800	922800	From Los Angeles to Miami, Latinos are rejecting the Anglo-Protestant values that built America.
922800	931000	Entire swaths of the population now have divided loyalties, dual nationalities, and transnational identities.
931000	938200	And this is cause for concern for the future cultural and even territorial integrity of the United States.
938400	943400	The greatest risk and largest challenge for the U.S. and its traditional identity
943400	947600	is from the massive, never-ending tidal wave of people
947600	952200	washing into the country from Latin America, and specifically, Mexico.
952200	954600	So that's the same old shit, really.
954600	961000	They're coming over here, they're not integrating, not learning the language, outbreeding us, and so on.
961000	965600	I particularly like the discarded doll's head with the worm in the eye socket there.
965600	968600	That's, uh, very subtle imagery.
969200	974600	So, anyway, someone might argue that there's enough negative press about immigrants out there
974600	980800	that we can't fairly dismiss the bias being shown in the train experiment as entirely illogical.
980800	983800	So what we really need here is another experiment,
983800	991400	one that tests whether this group bias exists for groups about which people cannot possibly have any prior preconceptions.
991400	996600	And would you believe it, such a study was described in detail, in the space between us.
996600	1000000	And I'll quote here from the section, Creating a Neighborhood.
1021400	1028000	But this perceptual type had actually already been randomly assigned by us prior to the beginning of the experiment.
1028000	1034000	We called these perceptual types Type H and Type Y, and those were our minimal groups.
1034000	1039400	Our intention was that the subjects would see the perceptual type to which they were assigned as their ingroup,
1039400	1041400	and the other as the outgroup.
1041400	1044600	Of course, we never told them these distinctions were important.
1044600	1049200	Rather, we just let the power of categorization take over to affect behavior.
1049200	1054800	We then manipulated spatial geography so that the distorting power of groups was amplified.
1054800	1057600	After we had administered the test of perceptual type,
1057600	1061200	the research assistants brought all the subjects into a waiting room,
1061200	1065200	telling them that the lecture hall had to be prepared for the next experiment.
1065200	1070600	It was in this waiting room that we created our neighborhood, segregated or integrated,
1070600	1074800	and thus the experimental treatment of segregation was administered.
1074800	1082400	In one condition, randomly assigned, the subjects would be segregated with members of each perceptual type on different sides of the room.
1082400	1088000	In the other condition, they would be integrated, randomly with respect to perceptual type, across the room.
1088000	1095400	The room had rows of chairs, so it really did look like a waiting room you might see at the dentist's office or at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
1095400	1098600	On the desks, we placed folders with further instructions.
1098600	1101400	Each folder was assigned to one of the participants,
1101400	1105600	which allowed us to unobtrusively arrange them to sit in certain locations.
1105600	1109200	The folders came in two colors, representing the two perceptual types,
1109200	1113400	so that the participants could see whether all the type Hs sat on one side of the room,
1113400	1116800	and all the type Ys on the other, or whether they were integrated.
1116800	1121200	The subjects were asked to wait there for five minutes without speaking or using their phones.
1121200	1126400	After five minutes, we sent each subject to a separate room for data collection.
1126400	1132200	The separate rooms were important because we wanted to ensure that the subjects answered our questions in private,
1132200	1135600	so as not to be biased by social desirability.
1135600	1139600	In the rooms, they answered two sets of questions on the laptop we provided.
1139600	1144600	Their perceptions of directly observable physical attributes of the two groups,
1144600	1148200	and their perceptions of social attributes of the two groups.
1148200	1151800	They were asked to give their best guesses about the levels of these attributes.
1151800	1154200	The physical attributes were height, weight, and age.
1154200	1157000	The social attributes were income and politics.
1157000	1161000	How liberal or conservative was the average member of each group?
1161000	1165000	After the participants reported their answers, the experiment was over.
1165000	1170400	We repeated this entire process until we had tested over 200 subjects in total.
1170400	1173000	The results of this unusual experiment?
1173000	1178800	After only five minutes of sitting in a certain spatial arrangement with groups that were completely fabricated,
1178800	1184400	our subjects thought that the heights, weights, and ages of people in their in-group were more similar to their own
1184400	1188600	than the heights, weights, and ages of people in their out-group were to their own.
1188600	1192400	They also thought that the people in their in-group were more socially similar to them
1192400	1196400	in terms of politics and income than people in the out-group were.
1196400	1202400	As other researchers have found, the simple act of categorizing had collapsed the difference within groups
1202400	1205200	and increased the difference across groups.
1205200	1206600	But here's the key.
1206600	1212600	This perceived difference between the out-group and in-group was even larger when the groups were segregated
1212600	1215000	than it was when they were integrated.
1215000	1216000	Think of it.
1216000	1222000	Five minutes of segregation was enough to change people's perceptions about other human beings.
1222000	1230600	So we see from that experiment that group-based biases exist even for completely fabricated and randomly assigned categories
1230600	1232400	that people just heard about.
1232400	1238000	Now, other prior studies have shown this before, but the twist that The Space Between Us introduces
1238000	1243600	is the extra test for the effect of segregation upon the extent of these group biases.
1243600	1248800	If you're segregated from the out-group, you're more likely to exhibit this bias.
1248800	1255200	For example, if you're a white person living in a white suburb, well, you get the picture.
1255200	1261200	What this book makes clear over and over again is that these biases are not exclusively racial.
1261200	1264800	You know, they can be geographical, religious.
1264800	1270400	Think about the changing importance of which Christian denomination people say they follow, for instance.
1270400	1275000	And in one interesting chapter in the book, group experiments are carried out in Jerusalem.
1275000	1282600	Now, I was expecting, as you might, that those group experiments would be testing relations between Israel and Palestine.
1282600	1289200	But no, the book instead concerns itself with the divisions between non-religious or moderately religious Jews
1289200	1292200	and what are described as ultra-orthodox Jews.
1292200	1295400	And, of course, those same group divisions were found.
1295400	1302200	This is why I believe the human tendency to form in-groups actually undermines the legitimacy of racial bias,
1302200	1310400	because we do the exact same thing even if we're randomly sorted into meaningless groups like H and Y, for example.
1310400	1315000	The Space Between Us is concerned with how we can create harmonious societies
1315000	1320600	while acknowledging that people form illogical groups and have illogical biases.
1320600	1326200	You can call those biases natural, but what does natural mean there?
1326200	1332000	You know, living naked in the woods is natural in one regard, and most of us don't do that.
1332000	1337600	Is that unnatural? Are hospitals natural? I don't know.
1337600	1341600	You know, if the human tendency to form illogical biases is natural,
1341600	1347800	then I propose that the human ability to recognize and overcome those biases is also natural.
1347800	1354400	You know, we needn't submit to irrationality just because we imagine it to be closer to a natural state of being.
1354400	1359800	Now, it's about time for me to wrap up here, but I'd like to return to BlackPigeonSpeaks for a moment.
1359800	1366400	I've avoided talking about the end of his video so far, but I think I should address it before I go.
1366400	1370400	I showed a clip of BlackPigeon a little while ago from a different video
1370400	1377000	bemoaning how Mexican immigrants into the United States aren't integrating, aren't learning the language, and so on.
1377000	1378600	And to quote him there,
1378600	1383800	"...the greatest risk and largest challenge for the U.S. and its traditional identity
1383800	1390200	is from the massive, never-ending tidal wave of people washing into the country from Latin America."
1390200	1394100	Now, with that quote in mind, let's watch a clip from the end of his
1394100	1398800	Diversity Plus Proximity Equals Republican Voters video.
1398900	1404200	Something else to consider when thinking of those that prognosticate a blue America
1404200	1409600	is that Latino Americans are increasingly identifying themselves as white.
1409600	1413300	Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses,
1413300	1419100	about 7% of Hispanics changed their self-description from some other race to white.
1419100	1421500	At the same time, according to the Census Bureau,
1421500	1426000	three-fourths of white population growth in 21st century America
1426000	1432100	has been driven by individuals who declared themselves white and of Hispanic origin.
1432100	1439800	If increasing numbers of Hispanics identify as white and their descendants are defined as white in government statistics,
1439800	1445600	there may be a white majority in the U.S. throughout the 21st century.
1445600	1450000	It is also possible that as Latinos assimilate and intermarry,
1450000	1454000	they will move from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party,
1454000	1459300	following a trailblazed in the past by many white ethnic voters of European descent,
1459300	1462700	including Irish Americans and Italian Americans.
1462700	1465400	Now then, you might be wondering,
1465400	1467300	what the fuck?
1467300	1470800	You know, what are immigrants to Black Pigeon Speaks?
1470800	1476200	One minute, they're a vast horde of barbarians flowing across the border and taking over,
1476200	1483600	and the next minute, they're all assimilating and intermarrying and voting Republican and identifying as white.
1483600	1485200	How can they be both?
1485200	1487600	You know, are they gonna integrate or not?
1487600	1493900	It seems like Black Pigeon Speaks' answer is dependent upon the particular argument he's having at the time.
1493900	1500500	It seems like as long as you're owning the libs, you can basically swap out any of your beliefs on the fly.
1500500	1503200	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1503300	1504200	Some news.

1524800	1526700	I wanna catch Hbomb up,
1526700	1530600	and it doesn't look like it's happening by itself anytime soon, unfortunately,
1530600	1533000	so I'm gonna have to resort to begging.
1533200	1537200	Thanks, as always, to all of my patrons over on Patreon.
1537200	1539600	I'm gonna go with Patreon today.
1539600	1542600	There was a bit of a credit kerfuffle last video.
1542600	1544800	Hopefully, everything is sorted this time.
1544800	1549000	If not, let me know, and I'll fix it eventually.
1549000	1552100	I'll put links to my Twitter and Curious Cat accounts below

1555000	1558000	I'll also include a link to our Twitch channel.
1558000	1562100	I get quite a lot of messages on Twitch expressing surprise that I'm on there,
1562100	1564300	so I thought I'd mention it here.
1564300	1571100	Me and Jen and Pete stream on Twitch on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays,
1571100	1573100	and sometimes other days, too.
1573100	1575100	So, there you go. Now you know.
1575100	1578100	Okay, folks, that's it from me. I'll see you next time.
