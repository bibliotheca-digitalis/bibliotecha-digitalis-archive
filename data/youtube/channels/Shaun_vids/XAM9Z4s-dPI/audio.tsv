0	7440	Hello everyone, today I'm going to be talking about reclusive YouTube shouty man Paul Joseph Watson,
7440	11800	and in particular his video The Truth About Popular Culture,
11800	16980	in which he argues that today's popular culture is ugly and decadent and meaningless,
16980	21620	whereas in the past it was apparently beautiful and uplifting and meaningful.
21620	25720	Now where Paul has went wrong here is that, being someone who is currently alive,
25720	29720	he is primarily exposed to contemporary culture and art,
29720	34560	culture and art which has not yet had the opportunity to pass the test of time.
34560	38100	But when he looks to the past, he only sees great works of art,
38100	42100	and this isn't because the past is filled with exclusively great works of art,
42100	47400	it's simply because all the rubbish art wasn't preserved in the same way that the great art was.
47900	49440	Because it was rubbish.
49440	53580	You know, time acts as a filter, sorting the valuable from the worthless,
53580	57580	and in the future, the same will be true of our generation's art and culture.
57580	59820	Anyway, thanks a lot for watching everyone.
59820	64080	Remember to like and subscribe, and you can follow me on Twitter, and...
65580	66420	Yeah, okay.
66420	69420	Uh, the old fake end to the video.
69420	70820	It's a classic.
70820	75260	So okay, even though I do feel like that was the fatal flaw in his argument,
75260	79100	there is a bit more to say here, so let's flesh things out a bit.
79260	84460	And I should add a disclaimer here that I've already watched a couple of responses to Paul's video,
84460	87660	made by people who know a lot more about popular culture than me,
87660	93340	so you should probably just go and watch those videos instead of my comparatively poor offering.
93340	98380	I personally don't know all that much about modern art or music, you see,
98380	102780	but I do know how to kick a man when he's down, so here we go.
103580	108860	Now, Paul tends to wander a bit in his arguments, which is fine, you know, so do I,
108860	113020	but he also frequently cuts himself off to insert a clip of him shouting something
113020	117660	that's usually only possibly related to what he was already saying.
117660	121820	As a result of this, his video's a bit of a mess, narratively speaking,
121820	124700	so rather than go through the video chronologically,
124700	127340	I'm just gonna break his argument down into sections.
127340	128620	So, part one.
129420	133580	Popular culture, and when Paul says popular culture here,
133580	138780	he cites modern television, art, music, theater, celebrity culture, whatever.
138780	142220	That all used to be wholesome and uplifting, apparently,
142220	145100	but is now a load of meaningless rubbish.
145100	147660	Culture is supposed to be uplifting.
147660	153100	It's supposed to infuse our lives with intrigue, lust for knowledge, and appreciation of beauty.
153100	158300	Instead, for the past two decades, pop culture has only served as a sewer pipe
158300	163660	of projectile diarrhea aimed directly at our gawping mouths.
163660	165420	So there's nothing that weird so far.
165500	168460	This is your standard grumpy old man argument,
168460	171580	just being held by someone 30 years too young.
171580	175100	This attitude is hardly exclusive to our generation, you know?
175100	177660	Are there any Fallout fans in the audience?
190460	193340	And this is from 1934.
193340	196780	However, part two is where this gets a bit more interesting.
197660	202620	This degradation of art and culture was orchestrated deliberately
202620	208940	by cultural Marxists in order to undermine and eventually destroy Western civilization.
208940	212220	And that's a bit more like it, because, let's be honest,
212220	215660	that sort of conspiracy nonsense is what we're really here for, isn't it?
216380	219580	Look at Karl Marx there, being evil.
219580	222380	Anyway, let's get to addressing these points.
222380	225980	And I would first advise people to go and watch Paul's video
225980	229100	so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his views.
229740	232620	I will be using some clips from his video as we go on,
232620	235100	but I'll also be proceeding under the assumption
235100	237740	that everyone watching from now on has seen it.
238620	241180	Hey, I had to watch it, you know?
241180	243500	The least you can do is watch it as well.
243500	245980	You can take breaks if you like, I did.
245980	250620	So okay, first off, art and culture used to be good,
250620	252460	and now it's all a load of rubbish.
253580	254460	Is that true?
254460	256860	Well, to answer that, we first need to determine
256860	259020	what sort of timescale we're talking about.
259020	262860	At what point was the art supposed to have gone from good to bad?
262860	265100	Paul is rather vague with his timescales here
265100	267180	and gives a few rather different answers
267180	271740	about when exactly he thinks this cultural degradation started.
271740	275500	You'd think, from the thumbnail of the video being Miley Cyrus
275500	277580	and him talking about reality television
277580	280540	and the likes that he's talking about the last decade or so.
280540	284300	But he is pinning all this on the so-called Cultural Marxists
284300	288620	and he shows this very scary picture of the Frankfurt School,
288620	291820	but that has roots back in the 20s and 30s,
291820	295020	and Paul even features Duchamp's fountain
295020	297820	in the section of his video complaining about modern art.
298780	302540	An art piece which is now literally a century old,
302540	304220	and you think he would have noticed that
304220	307340	because it has the date printed on it right there, if you look.
307340	308860	So, what's my point here?
308860	311180	Well, Paul's timeline is all messed up.
311180	314780	He's showing things that he veryingly calls good or bad
314780	317660	and acting like there's some sort of chronology to it,
317660	318940	when there isn't, really.
318940	323260	You know, he uses clips from modern TV shows and movies and music
323260	325740	that he seems to think are pretty good,
325740	328460	that came out half a century or more
328460	332220	after this supposed Cultural Marxist takeover of society
332220	336060	started filling the art museums with urinals and the likes.
336060	338140	So let's talk about this urinal, actually.
338140	341180	Now, again, I don't know too much about art history,
341180	344380	but I know that this particular piece is kind of a big deal.
345020	346380	And I agree with that.
346380	347340	I think it's great.
348060	351580	Although I wouldn't fault someone who, like Paul, was thinking,
351580	353260	well, how can this be great?
353260	355820	It's just an everyday thing like a urinal.
355820	357020	It's meaningless.
357020	360140	Well, the work of art here is not so much the urinal.
360140	363340	It's in the act of exhibiting the urinal.
363340	365580	It makes an important point about art,
365580	366860	and in the case of this piece,
366860	369580	it's a point that hadn't really been made before.
369580	373660	It provokes debate about what art is and where the boundaries are.
374300	376620	That's the point of a lot of modern art, actually.
376620	379500	You know, they're not aiming for Michelangelo's David
379500	381900	and ending up with a urinal accidentally.
382460	384300	There's a point behind it.
384300	385500	Speaking of behinds...
386860	388540	How's that for a link there?
388540	392220	A giant ass was nominated for the Turner Prize.
392220	394140	I mean, forget full retard.
394140	396460	We've gone full idiocracy.
396460	401820	Now then, Paul, what you missed was the Turner Prize website just openly states
401820	404780	the Turner Prize provokes debate about art.
404780	407820	Like, that is one of its actual aims.
407820	411500	And I don't know if Paul noticed this, but it worked, didn't it?
411500	415180	It got him talking about what is and is not art, at least.
415180	417340	And it provoked me to ask a question.
417340	421260	You know, can a representation of an arse be art?
421260	422220	So let's have a think.
422860	428060	This is The Tennis Girl, a popular British poster from 1976,
428060	432380	showing a photograph of a lady playing tennis and revealing her posterior.
433180	433980	What do we think?
433980	435180	Is this art or not?
435820	441820	I bring this up because in 2015, the Wimbledon Twitter account tweeted a picture of the poster
441820	446860	and then got into some mildly hot water about tweeting out a photograph of a bare arse,
446860	449660	and they deleted it and apologized.
449660	454300	Now, given that it was something that happened and it was on the internet, of course,
454860	457100	feminists got the blame for it.
457100	461740	Those evil social justice warriors going around censoring art.
461740	465660	Radical feminists are once again channeling their inner ISIS
465660	469900	by attempting to eradicate iconic art from the pages of history.
469900	475420	The Athena Tennis Girl poster is one of the most archetypal images of the last 50 years.
475420	478540	It sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.
478540	482060	But when the Wimbledon Tennis Club announced that they would feature the photograph
482060	485020	at an exhibition called Powerful Posters,
485020	487180	third wave feminists went to war,
487180	491980	tweeting their invective until the Wimbledon Club caved in and apologized.
491980	495820	By the end of the night, some feminists were calling for the poster to be, quote,
495820	500220	eradicated from history, justifying the cultural cleansing of art
500220	506060	to appease their warped political dogma in the same spirit as ISIS militants
506140	508860	when they destroy ancient artifacts in the Middle East,
508860	511740	in the same spirit as Hitler and Stalin,
511740	513820	who banned beautiful and iconic art
513820	516860	because it didn't conform with their extremist authoritarian taste.
517580	519820	Art it is, then, according to Paul.
519820	521580	So that's interesting, isn't it?
521580	524460	This is not art, but this is art.
525340	531660	I'm gonna have to invent something here called the Paul Joseph Watson Arse Art Scale.
531660	533580	So at one end, we have art.
533580	537100	This is art, clearly, a classic photograph of an arse
537100	540700	that must be protected from the attentions of the evil feminists.
541260	543740	This, on the other hand, this is not art.
543740	547660	This is a pointless and meaningless waste of time and effort.
547660	552940	So the point here, Paul, is betwixt these dual cheeks of art and not art,
552940	557260	there is an invisible... crack, shall we say.
557260	561020	A dividing line that separates the art from the not art.
561260	563820	At what point does something become art?
563820	568940	What criteria did you use to classify this as art and this as not being art?
568940	570940	I mean, I disagree with you personally.
570940	572060	I think they're both art,
572060	575820	but I'm judging them by different criteria than you are, clearly.
575820	578060	And the point of a lot of conceptual art
578060	582300	is to provoke exactly these sorts of boundary discussions.
582300	587580	When you tell a story about some conceptual art piece getting mistaken for something else,
587660	592780	you know, you accidentally sat on a chair because you didn't realize it was meant to be art.
592780	596460	A cleaner threw out an exhibit because they didn't realize it was art.
597180	599820	That's the point, man, you know?
599820	604780	And yes, a lot of it might be rubbish, but that's the risk they're taking, you know?
604780	606540	And I'd like to point something out here.
606540	610940	Paul's acting like all contemporary art is fringe conceptual art.
610940	613740	Have you ever visited Tate Modern in London?
613740	619980	It's a giant building full of scrap metal, concrete blocks, urinals, and this.
620620	623580	Whatever it is, they call it an art gallery.
623580	627020	It more closely resembles a landfill site.
627020	628860	However, this is just not the case.
629420	634380	Let's take a look at what's on in the Tate Modern right now using internet.
634380	637900	An exhibition of a fine art portrait photographer.
638460	642620	An exhibition of Sir Elton John's photographic collection.
642620	648460	An exhibition of six decades of the works of early pop artist Robert Rauschenberg.
649100	652460	A bunch of these cool sorts of fish things.
653100	658860	And there's also a bunch of films being shown and art workshops and tours and talks and things.
658860	662540	It's not all dog turds in bags, you know, Paul.
662540	666780	You're just cherry-picking the most intentionally provocative fringe stuff
666780	669340	and making it seem like that's all there is.
669340	673340	Actually, this is Paul's tactic for all the subjects he covers in his video,
673340	675660	not just the modern art section, you know?
675660	679660	Deliberately choosing only the most provocative things to react to,
679660	684540	like the time salon.com featured a video by an open pedophile.
684540	686780	They're fetishizing pathology.
686780	692780	We're even seeing the mainstreaming of pedophilia by the news and entertainment media.
692780	697420	Salon.com giving a platform to a wannabe child molester.
697420	700700	Now, I went and watched that video and that guy was making the case
700700	704620	that he's not a child molester and doesn't want to abuse children,
704620	709020	but he acknowledges his attraction to children and that it's a problem,
709020	711820	and he wants to help other people like him get help.
712700	714780	Which, you know, am I crazy?
714780	719580	Because that seems like it's a good thing, but, you know, whatever.
719580	723180	And a fun point of comparison here is Milo Yiannopoulos,
723180	726540	recently landing himself in trouble by, funnily enough,
727100	731420	appearing to condone child molestation and who leapt to his defense,
731420	733900	but of course, Paul Joseph Watson,
733900	737580	who oddly doesn't seem to be all that bothered by child abuse
737580	742220	when the person supporting it happens to share his political opinions.
742220	748940	Paul also sees fit to judge all modern television by a few cherry-picked provocative moments.
748940	750140	Look at television!
750140	755020	TV's endless portrayal of broken families, emasculated male figures,
755020	758460	and aberrant, nihilistic, droog-like youths.
758460	762940	Broken families and emasculated male figures, you say.
763660	767260	Now, this confused me because elsewhere in the video,
767260	772300	Paul condemns modern theater for not being as good as Shakespeare.
772300	773740	Look at modern theater!
773740	777260	We went from Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde to this.
778140	786300	They're making everything that's supposed to be exquisite, hideous and repugnant.
786300	791340	Now, the inference there is that Paul thinks Shakespeare is good, I guess,
791340	796220	but he doesn't like depictions of broken families and emasculated male figures,
796220	801180	so he likes King Lear, but not depictions of broken families,
801180	805660	and he likes Macbeth, but not emasculated male figures.
805660	807260	Is that all correct, Paul?
807260	810140	Because I'm very sorry, but I have to conclude
810140	814300	that you don't actually know what you're talking about when it comes to Shakespeare.
814300	817020	You just know he's got a reputation for being good,
817580	820540	but you don't really seem to understand why that is.
820540	823340	Now, I like these sorts of little contradictory points.
823340	824460	Shall we do another one?
824460	830460	What has my generation contributed to advance popular culture over the last 30 years?
830460	832380	Humiliatingly little.
832380	834700	Seriously, what have we contributed?
834700	837100	Can you name anything positive?
837100	842060	So what can we name from popular culture from the last 30 years that is actually good?
842060	846060	Well, when Paul is elsewhere complaining about the state of modern music,
846060	851180	he shows as positive examples Nirvana and Marilyn Manson,
851180	855980	who, Paul, both came to prominence in the last 30 years.
855980	861340	There's also the point here that Paul is again neglecting to mention the test of time.
861340	863900	You know, there's all sorts of music around today,
863900	868540	but who knows what people decades in the future are gonna still be listening to?
868540	870140	And when he mentions those bands,
870140	874940	Paul is lamenting the fact that there isn't a counterculture movement anymore.
874940	877660	You know, it used to be that you'd have the mainstream
877660	879820	and then the various alternative scenes,
879820	883180	but today, apparently, we've only got the one thing.
883180	888220	You're only ever allowed to listen to One Direction and Miley Cyrus, apparently,
888220	889580	and nothing else.
889580	891180	This is very silly, of course,
891180	894780	because Paul is avoiding talking about something key here,
894780	899980	and it's odd because it's the thing he personally uses to get his own videos out there.
899980	901740	It's the internet.
901740	904700	You see, way back in the pre-internet olden times,
904700	907020	whatever television you could watch was limited
907020	910540	to whatever happened to be on the two or three channels you could get.
911100	914700	And the only movies you could watch were whatever was in the cinema.
914700	918940	And likewise, the only music you were listening to was what was on the radio.
918940	923900	There really was a dominant media mainstream back then to organize against.
923900	927980	Today, though, those sorts of movements aren't as necessary.
927980	931660	If you don't like One Direction or Justin Bieber or whatever,
931660	933100	you can just ignore them,
933100	934780	because thanks to the internet,
934780	938700	you've got instant access to all different types of things,
938700	943180	and an opportunity to meet other people who are also into those sorts of things.
943180	946860	Now, just speaking personally, but I read Japanese authors
946860	950300	and watch Korean TV shows and American films
950300	953740	and listen to music and play video games from all over the place.
954380	957580	I personally couldn't give a toss what's in the current top ten
957580	961740	because I don't have to be exposed to it if I don't want to be.
961740	967100	Speaking of video games, actually, why doesn't Paul talk about games in his video?
967100	971500	Video games are an increasingly large part of modern popular culture,
971500	974380	and they've gotten more violent and sexual over the years.
974940	980140	Actually, I can just put Paul's narration over some video game footage to make this point.
980140	983100	Popular culture is also hyper sexualized.
983100	987500	It's not prudish to observe that the sexual imagery we're bombarded with
987500	991580	is infinitely more gratuitous than it was just 25 years ago.
991580	996620	But since Paul's audience is made up of a bunch of video game playing teenage boys,
996620	999020	he'd never do that, would he, you know?
999020	1001660	He's got them all sitting there nodding along with him,
1001660	1005660	condemning the violence and sex on television, but not in video games.
1006460	1009900	Still got a panda to the gamergate crowd, I see, Paul.
1009900	1013180	So, increased violence and sex on television
1013180	1017580	is indoctrinating the youth into thinking that that behavior is normal.
1017580	1020060	But increased violence and sex in video games,
1020060	1023420	well, that could never have any negative effects, could it?
1023420	1027420	It's funny to see Paul using Anita Sarkeesian's arguments
1027420	1032860	just aimed at every other aspect of popular culture except for video games.
1032860	1034300	Just before I wrap up here,
1034300	1037820	I'd like to talk about something else that Paul is neglecting to mention.
1037820	1040940	Something that actually is behind a lot of the problems
1040940	1047420	he is mistakenly attributing to this imagined cultural decline, and that's economics.
1047420	1051180	For instance, here's Paul talking about modern suicide rates.
1051180	1055820	It's no surprise that since the explosion of celebrity-led narcissism,
1055900	1058620	young people are more depressed than ever.
1058620	1064540	Suicides amongst those aged 10 to 24 are up every year since 2010.
1064540	1066780	Why are you all so unhappy?
1066780	1070460	Because you're aspiring to something completely vacuous
1070460	1073500	and unobtainable for the vast majority of people.
1073500	1076140	Suicide rates have been going up lately, apparently,
1076140	1079580	and this is down to cultural degradation, according to Paul.
1079580	1083820	But does anyone remember anything else from the late noughties
1084460	1087660	that could possibly be a contributing factor here?
1088460	1091020	Something rather big sprung to mind for me.
1091660	1097420	You see, we're living in the aftermath of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
1097420	1102140	I think that that might be having more of an effect on the state of people's mental health
1102140	1105820	than Jersey Shore or whatever Katy Perry is up to.
1106380	1110220	Paul does something similar with the US incarceration rate.
1110220	1111420	Gangster rap?
1111420	1114460	A movement that encouraged millions upon millions of young people
1114460	1118300	to aspire to act like degenerate criminal thugs.
1118300	1120380	Yeah, that worked out great, didn't it?
1120380	1125340	You see, he's blaming the effects of the government's failed war on drugs policies
1125340	1131180	on gangster rap, which is putting the cart before the horse, to put it mildly.
1131180	1135260	You see, because Paul's so focused on trying to expose the imaginary
1135260	1139420	cultural Marxist puppet masters behind all the problems with popular culture,
1139420	1144300	he fails to notice that a lot of these problems are actually capitalist in nature.
1144300	1147740	You know, why are the celebrities doing these provocative things?
1147740	1152700	Well, because it's provocative, it gets attention, it gets an audience,
1152700	1158460	and they need as big an audience as possible to make as much money as they possibly can.
1158460	1163900	It's the same reason that you, Paul, used a provocative photograph of Miley Cyrus
1163900	1165820	as the thumbnail for your video.
1166540	1168380	You didn't have to do that.
1168380	1171180	I mean, you also mentioned Shakespeare in the video,
1171180	1174620	but you didn't use this as the thumbnail, did you?
1174620	1178460	Because you knew that this would get more clicks.
1178460	1181420	Paul's guilty of a lot of what he criticizes here.
1181420	1185020	He looks down on a woman filming her own face and talking
1185020	1188460	before cutting back to a film of his own talking face,
1189020	1191740	with apparently no irony whatsoever.
1191740	1194940	He condemns people for being social media obsessed
1194940	1199420	while bragging on his Twitter account about how many followers he has.
1199420	1203580	He plays this clip to represent rubbish popular music.
1203580	1206300	Why do you think everything sounds the same?
1206300	1210300	The same procession of electronic beats, repeated hooks,
1210300	1214140	and verbal diarrhea that passes for popular music now.
1214140	1217260	["Popular Music"]
1217260	1219660	But he then closes his video out with this.
1220540	1229500	["Popular Music"]
1229500	1232860	I mean, why not some nice violins instead, Paul?
1232860	1235260	You know, some Beethoven, maybe.
1235260	1237100	So, what's my conclusion here?
1237100	1241340	Well, Paul, do you want to come for a drink, man?
1241980	1243500	You know, get out the house a bit.
1243500	1245820	I think you've got cabin fever, dude.
1245900	1249660	It's not healthy, and this is a genuine offer, by the way.
1249660	1254060	I will actually get the train down and take you for a drink if you're up for it.
1254060	1255820	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1256380	1260540	Remember to like and subscribe if you feel like, and follow me on Twitter,
1260540	1262940	even though I mainly just talk a load of nonsense.
1262940	1265660	Um, and if you'd like more videos like this,
1265660	1268460	consider pledging me a dollar over on Patreon.
1268460	1271580	We're more than halfway to our next milestone over there,
1271580	1274620	and would you believe it, I'm very excited about the whole thing.
1274620	1280060	The generosity of my supporters has blown me away, and now I am dead.
1280940	1282540	Anyway, see you next time.
