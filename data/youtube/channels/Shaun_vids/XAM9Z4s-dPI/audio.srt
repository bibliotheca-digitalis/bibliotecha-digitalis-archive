00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Hello everyone, today I'm going to be talking about reclusive YouTube shouty man Paul Joseph Watson,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,800
and in particular his video The Truth About Popular Culture,

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,980
in which he argues that today's popular culture is ugly and decadent and meaningless,

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,620
whereas in the past it was apparently beautiful and uplifting and meaningful.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,720
Now where Paul has went wrong here is that, being someone who is currently alive,

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,720
he is primarily exposed to contemporary culture and art,

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,560
culture and art which has not yet had the opportunity to pass the test of time.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,100
But when he looks to the past, he only sees great works of art,

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,100
and this isn't because the past is filled with exclusively great works of art,

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,400
it's simply because all the rubbish art wasn't preserved in the same way that the great art was.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,440
Because it was rubbish.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,580
You know, time acts as a filter, sorting the valuable from the worthless,

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,580
and in the future, the same will be true of our generation's art and culture.

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,820
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching everyone.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,080
Remember to like and subscribe, and you can follow me on Twitter, and...

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,420
Yeah, okay.

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,420
Uh, the old fake end to the video.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,820
It's a classic.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,260
So okay, even though I do feel like that was the fatal flaw in his argument,

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,100
there is a bit more to say here, so let's flesh things out a bit.

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,460
And I should add a disclaimer here that I've already watched a couple of responses to Paul's video,

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,660
made by people who know a lot more about popular culture than me,

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:33,340
so you should probably just go and watch those videos instead of my comparatively poor offering.

24
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,380
I personally don't know all that much about modern art or music, you see,

25
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,780
but I do know how to kick a man when he's down, so here we go.

26
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,860
Now, Paul tends to wander a bit in his arguments, which is fine, you know, so do I,

27
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,020
but he also frequently cuts himself off to insert a clip of him shouting something

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,660
that's usually only possibly related to what he was already saying.

29
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,820
As a result of this, his video's a bit of a mess, narratively speaking,

30
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,700
so rather than go through the video chronologically,

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,340
I'm just gonna break his argument down into sections.

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,620
So, part one.

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,580
Popular culture, and when Paul says popular culture here,

34
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,780
he cites modern television, art, music, theater, celebrity culture, whatever.

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,220
That all used to be wholesome and uplifting, apparently,

36
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,100
but is now a load of meaningless rubbish.

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,660
Culture is supposed to be uplifting.

38
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,100
It's supposed to infuse our lives with intrigue, lust for knowledge, and appreciation of beauty.

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,300
Instead, for the past two decades, pop culture has only served as a sewer pipe

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,660
of projectile diarrhea aimed directly at our gawping mouths.

41
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,420
So there's nothing that weird so far.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,460
This is your standard grumpy old man argument,

43
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,580
just being held by someone 30 years too young.

44
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,100
This attitude is hardly exclusive to our generation, you know?

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,660
Are there any Fallout fans in the audience?

46
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,340
And this is from 1934.

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,780
However, part two is where this gets a bit more interesting.

48
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,620
This degradation of art and culture was orchestrated deliberately

49
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,940
by cultural Marxists in order to undermine and eventually destroy Western civilization.

50
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,220
And that's a bit more like it, because, let's be honest,

51
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,660
that sort of conspiracy nonsense is what we're really here for, isn't it?

52
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,580
Look at Karl Marx there, being evil.

53
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,380
Anyway, let's get to addressing these points.

54
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,980
And I would first advise people to go and watch Paul's video

55
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,100
so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his views.

56
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,620
I will be using some clips from his video as we go on,

57
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,100
but I'll also be proceeding under the assumption

58
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,740
that everyone watching from now on has seen it.

59
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,180
Hey, I had to watch it, you know?

60
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,500
The least you can do is watch it as well.

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,980
You can take breaks if you like, I did.

62
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,620
So okay, first off, art and culture used to be good,

63
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,460
and now it's all a load of rubbish.

64
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,460
Is that true?

65
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,860
Well, to answer that, we first need to determine

66
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,020
what sort of timescale we're talking about.

67
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,860
At what point was the art supposed to have gone from good to bad?

68
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,100
Paul is rather vague with his timescales here

69
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,180
and gives a few rather different answers

70
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,740
about when exactly he thinks this cultural degradation started.

71
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,500
You'd think, from the thumbnail of the video being Miley Cyrus

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,580
and him talking about reality television

73
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,540
and the likes that he's talking about the last decade or so.

74
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,300
But he is pinning all this on the so-called Cultural Marxists

75
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,620
and he shows this very scary picture of the Frankfurt School,

76
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,820
but that has roots back in the 20s and 30s,

77
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,020
and Paul even features Duchamp's fountain

78
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,820
in the section of his video complaining about modern art.

79
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,540
An art piece which is now literally a century old,

80
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,220
and you think he would have noticed that

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,340
because it has the date printed on it right there, if you look.

82
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,860
So, what's my point here?

83
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,180
Well, Paul's timeline is all messed up.

84
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,780
He's showing things that he veryingly calls good or bad

85
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,660
and acting like there's some sort of chronology to it,

86
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,940
when there isn't, really.

87
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,260
You know, he uses clips from modern TV shows and movies and music

88
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,740
that he seems to think are pretty good,

89
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,460
that came out half a century or more

90
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,220
after this supposed Cultural Marxist takeover of society

91
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,060
started filling the art museums with urinals and the likes.

92
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,140
So let's talk about this urinal, actually.

93
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,180
Now, again, I don't know too much about art history,

94
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,380
but I know that this particular piece is kind of a big deal.

95
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,380
And I agree with that.

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,340
I think it's great.

97
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,580
Although I wouldn't fault someone who, like Paul, was thinking,

98
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,260
well, how can this be great?

99
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,820
It's just an everyday thing like a urinal.

100
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,020
It's meaningless.

101
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,140
Well, the work of art here is not so much the urinal.

102
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,340
It's in the act of exhibiting the urinal.

103
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,580
It makes an important point about art,

104
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,860
and in the case of this piece,

105
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,580
it's a point that hadn't really been made before.

106
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,660
It provokes debate about what art is and where the boundaries are.

107
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,620
That's the point of a lot of modern art, actually.

108
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,500
You know, they're not aiming for Michelangelo's David

109
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,900
and ending up with a urinal accidentally.

110
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,300
There's a point behind it.

111
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,500
Speaking of behinds...

112
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,540
How's that for a link there?

113
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,220
A giant ass was nominated for the Turner Prize.

114
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,140
I mean, forget full retard.

115
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,460
We've gone full idiocracy.

116
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,820
Now then, Paul, what you missed was the Turner Prize website just openly states

117
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,780
the Turner Prize provokes debate about art.

118
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,820
Like, that is one of its actual aims.

119
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,500
And I don't know if Paul noticed this, but it worked, didn't it?

120
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,180
It got him talking about what is and is not art, at least.

121
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,340
And it provoked me to ask a question.

122
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,260
You know, can a representation of an arse be art?

123
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,220
So let's have a think.

124
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,060
This is The Tennis Girl, a popular British poster from 1976,

125
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,380
showing a photograph of a lady playing tennis and revealing her posterior.

126
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,980
What do we think?

127
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,180
Is this art or not?

128
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,820
I bring this up because in 2015, the Wimbledon Twitter account tweeted a picture of the poster

129
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,860
and then got into some mildly hot water about tweeting out a photograph of a bare arse,

130
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,660
and they deleted it and apologized.

131
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,300
Now, given that it was something that happened and it was on the internet, of course,

132
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,100
feminists got the blame for it.

133
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,740
Those evil social justice warriors going around censoring art.

134
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,660
Radical feminists are once again channeling their inner ISIS

135
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,900
by attempting to eradicate iconic art from the pages of history.

136
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,420
The Athena Tennis Girl poster is one of the most archetypal images of the last 50 years.

137
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,540
It sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.

138
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,060
But when the Wimbledon Tennis Club announced that they would feature the photograph

139
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,020
at an exhibition called Powerful Posters,

140
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,180
third wave feminists went to war,

141
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,980
tweeting their invective until the Wimbledon Club caved in and apologized.

142
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,820
By the end of the night, some feminists were calling for the poster to be, quote,

143
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,220
eradicated from history, justifying the cultural cleansing of art

144
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,060
to appease their warped political dogma in the same spirit as ISIS militants

145
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,860
when they destroy ancient artifacts in the Middle East,

146
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,740
in the same spirit as Hitler and Stalin,

147
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,820
who banned beautiful and iconic art

148
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,860
because it didn't conform with their extremist authoritarian taste.

149
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,820
Art it is, then, according to Paul.

150
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,580
So that's interesting, isn't it?

151
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,460
This is not art, but this is art.

152
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,660
I'm gonna have to invent something here called the Paul Joseph Watson Arse Art Scale.

153
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,580
So at one end, we have art.

154
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,100
This is art, clearly, a classic photograph of an arse

155
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,700
that must be protected from the attentions of the evil feminists.

156
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,740
This, on the other hand, this is not art.

157
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,660
This is a pointless and meaningless waste of time and effort.

158
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,940
So the point here, Paul, is betwixt these dual cheeks of art and not art,

159
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,260
there is an invisible... crack, shall we say.

160
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,020
A dividing line that separates the art from the not art.

161
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,820
At what point does something become art?

162
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,940
What criteria did you use to classify this as art and this as not being art?

163
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,940
I mean, I disagree with you personally.

164
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,060
I think they're both art,

165
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,820
but I'm judging them by different criteria than you are, clearly.

166
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,060
And the point of a lot of conceptual art

167
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,300
is to provoke exactly these sorts of boundary discussions.

168
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,580
When you tell a story about some conceptual art piece getting mistaken for something else,

169
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,780
you know, you accidentally sat on a chair because you didn't realize it was meant to be art.

170
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,460
A cleaner threw out an exhibit because they didn't realize it was art.

171
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,820
That's the point, man, you know?

172
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,780
And yes, a lot of it might be rubbish, but that's the risk they're taking, you know?

173
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,540
And I'd like to point something out here.

174
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,940
Paul's acting like all contemporary art is fringe conceptual art.

175
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,740
Have you ever visited Tate Modern in London?

176
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,980
It's a giant building full of scrap metal, concrete blocks, urinals, and this.

177
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,580
Whatever it is, they call it an art gallery.

178
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,020
It more closely resembles a landfill site.

179
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,860
However, this is just not the case.

180
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,380
Let's take a look at what's on in the Tate Modern right now using internet.

181
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,900
An exhibition of a fine art portrait photographer.

182
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,620
An exhibition of Sir Elton John's photographic collection.

183
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,460
An exhibition of six decades of the works of early pop artist Robert Rauschenberg.

184
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,460
A bunch of these cool sorts of fish things.

185
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,860
And there's also a bunch of films being shown and art workshops and tours and talks and things.

186
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,540
It's not all dog turds in bags, you know, Paul.

187
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,780
You're just cherry-picking the most intentionally provocative fringe stuff

188
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,340
and making it seem like that's all there is.

189
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Actually, this is Paul's tactic for all the subjects he covers in his video,

190
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,660
not just the modern art section, you know?

191
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,660
Deliberately choosing only the most provocative things to react to,

192
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,540
like the time salon.com featured a video by an open pedophile.

193
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,780
They're fetishizing pathology.

194
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,780
We're even seeing the mainstreaming of pedophilia by the news and entertainment media.

195
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,420
Salon.com giving a platform to a wannabe child molester.

196
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,700
Now, I went and watched that video and that guy was making the case

197
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,620
that he's not a child molester and doesn't want to abuse children,

198
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,020
but he acknowledges his attraction to children and that it's a problem,

199
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,820
and he wants to help other people like him get help.

200
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,780
Which, you know, am I crazy?

201
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,580
Because that seems like it's a good thing, but, you know, whatever.

202
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,180
And a fun point of comparison here is Milo Yiannopoulos,

203
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,540
recently landing himself in trouble by, funnily enough,

204
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,420
appearing to condone child molestation and who leapt to his defense,

205
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,900
but of course, Paul Joseph Watson,

206
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,580
who oddly doesn't seem to be all that bothered by child abuse

207
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,220
when the person supporting it happens to share his political opinions.

208
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,940
Paul also sees fit to judge all modern television by a few cherry-picked provocative moments.

209
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,140
Look at television!

210
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,020
TV's endless portrayal of broken families, emasculated male figures,

211
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,460
and aberrant, nihilistic, droog-like youths.

212
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,940
Broken families and emasculated male figures, you say.

213
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,260
Now, this confused me because elsewhere in the video,

214
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,300
Paul condemns modern theater for not being as good as Shakespeare.

215
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,740
Look at modern theater!

216
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,260
We went from Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde to this.

217
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:06,300
They're making everything that's supposed to be exquisite, hideous and repugnant.

218
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,340
Now, the inference there is that Paul thinks Shakespeare is good, I guess,

219
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,220
but he doesn't like depictions of broken families and emasculated male figures,

220
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,180
so he likes King Lear, but not depictions of broken families,

221
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,660
and he likes Macbeth, but not emasculated male figures.

222
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,260
Is that all correct, Paul?

223
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,140
Because I'm very sorry, but I have to conclude

224
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,300
that you don't actually know what you're talking about when it comes to Shakespeare.

225
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,020
You just know he's got a reputation for being good,

226
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,540
but you don't really seem to understand why that is.

227
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,340
Now, I like these sorts of little contradictory points.

228
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,460
Shall we do another one?

229
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,460
What has my generation contributed to advance popular culture over the last 30 years?

230
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,380
Humiliatingly little.

231
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,700
Seriously, what have we contributed?

232
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,100
Can you name anything positive?

233
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,060
So what can we name from popular culture from the last 30 years that is actually good?

234
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,060
Well, when Paul is elsewhere complaining about the state of modern music,

235
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,180
he shows as positive examples Nirvana and Marilyn Manson,

236
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,980
who, Paul, both came to prominence in the last 30 years.

237
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,340
There's also the point here that Paul is again neglecting to mention the test of time.

238
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,900
You know, there's all sorts of music around today,

239
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,540
but who knows what people decades in the future are gonna still be listening to?

240
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,140
And when he mentions those bands,

241
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,940
Paul is lamenting the fact that there isn't a counterculture movement anymore.

242
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,660
You know, it used to be that you'd have the mainstream

243
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,820
and then the various alternative scenes,

244
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,180
but today, apparently, we've only got the one thing.

245
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,220
You're only ever allowed to listen to One Direction and Miley Cyrus, apparently,

246
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,580
and nothing else.

247
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,180
This is very silly, of course,

248
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,780
because Paul is avoiding talking about something key here,

249
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,980
and it's odd because it's the thing he personally uses to get his own videos out there.

250
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,740
It's the internet.

251
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,700
You see, way back in the pre-internet olden times,

252
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,020
whatever television you could watch was limited

253
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,540
to whatever happened to be on the two or three channels you could get.

254
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,700
And the only movies you could watch were whatever was in the cinema.

255
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,940
And likewise, the only music you were listening to was what was on the radio.

256
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,900
There really was a dominant media mainstream back then to organize against.

257
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,980
Today, though, those sorts of movements aren't as necessary.

258
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,660
If you don't like One Direction or Justin Bieber or whatever,

259
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,100
you can just ignore them,

260
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,780
because thanks to the internet,

261
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,700
you've got instant access to all different types of things,

262
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,180
and an opportunity to meet other people who are also into those sorts of things.

263
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,860
Now, just speaking personally, but I read Japanese authors

264
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,300
and watch Korean TV shows and American films

265
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,740
and listen to music and play video games from all over the place.

266
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,580
I personally couldn't give a toss what's in the current top ten

267
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,740
because I don't have to be exposed to it if I don't want to be.

268
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,100
Speaking of video games, actually, why doesn't Paul talk about games in his video?

269
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,500
Video games are an increasingly large part of modern popular culture,

270
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,380
and they've gotten more violent and sexual over the years.

271
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,140
Actually, I can just put Paul's narration over some video game footage to make this point.

272
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,100
Popular culture is also hyper sexualized.

273
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,500
It's not prudish to observe that the sexual imagery we're bombarded with

274
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,580
is infinitely more gratuitous than it was just 25 years ago.

275
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,620
But since Paul's audience is made up of a bunch of video game playing teenage boys,

276
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,020
he'd never do that, would he, you know?

277
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,660
He's got them all sitting there nodding along with him,

278
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,660
condemning the violence and sex on television, but not in video games.

279
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,900
Still got a panda to the gamergate crowd, I see, Paul.

280
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,180
So, increased violence and sex on television

281
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,580
is indoctrinating the youth into thinking that that behavior is normal.

282
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,060
But increased violence and sex in video games,

283
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,420
well, that could never have any negative effects, could it?

284
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,420
It's funny to see Paul using Anita Sarkeesian's arguments

285
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,860
just aimed at every other aspect of popular culture except for video games.

286
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,300
Just before I wrap up here,

287
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,820
I'd like to talk about something else that Paul is neglecting to mention.

288
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,940
Something that actually is behind a lot of the problems

289
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:27,420
he is mistakenly attributing to this imagined cultural decline, and that's economics.

290
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,180
For instance, here's Paul talking about modern suicide rates.

291
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,820
It's no surprise that since the explosion of celebrity-led narcissism,

292
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,620
young people are more depressed than ever.

293
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:44,540
Suicides amongst those aged 10 to 24 are up every year since 2010.

294
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,780
Why are you all so unhappy?

295
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,460
Because you're aspiring to something completely vacuous

296
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,500
and unobtainable for the vast majority of people.

297
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,140
Suicide rates have been going up lately, apparently,

298
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,580
and this is down to cultural degradation, according to Paul.

299
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,820
But does anyone remember anything else from the late noughties

300
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,660
that could possibly be a contributing factor here?

301
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,020
Something rather big sprung to mind for me.

302
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,420
You see, we're living in the aftermath of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

303
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,140
I think that that might be having more of an effect on the state of people's mental health

304
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,820
than Jersey Shore or whatever Katy Perry is up to.

305
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,220
Paul does something similar with the US incarceration rate.

306
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,420
Gangster rap?

307
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,460
A movement that encouraged millions upon millions of young people

308
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,300
to aspire to act like degenerate criminal thugs.

309
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,380
Yeah, that worked out great, didn't it?

310
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,340
You see, he's blaming the effects of the government's failed war on drugs policies

311
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,180
on gangster rap, which is putting the cart before the horse, to put it mildly.

312
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,260
You see, because Paul's so focused on trying to expose the imaginary

313
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,420
cultural Marxist puppet masters behind all the problems with popular culture,

314
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,300
he fails to notice that a lot of these problems are actually capitalist in nature.

315
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,740
You know, why are the celebrities doing these provocative things?

316
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,700
Well, because it's provocative, it gets attention, it gets an audience,

317
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,460
and they need as big an audience as possible to make as much money as they possibly can.

318
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,900
It's the same reason that you, Paul, used a provocative photograph of Miley Cyrus

319
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,820
as the thumbnail for your video.

320
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,380
You didn't have to do that.

321
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,180
I mean, you also mentioned Shakespeare in the video,

322
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,620
but you didn't use this as the thumbnail, did you?

323
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,460
Because you knew that this would get more clicks.

324
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,420
Paul's guilty of a lot of what he criticizes here.

325
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,020
He looks down on a woman filming her own face and talking

326
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,460
before cutting back to a film of his own talking face,

327
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,740
with apparently no irony whatsoever.

328
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,940
He condemns people for being social media obsessed

329
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,420
while bragging on his Twitter account about how many followers he has.

330
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,580
He plays this clip to represent rubbish popular music.

331
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,300
Why do you think everything sounds the same?

332
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,300
The same procession of electronic beats, repeated hooks,

333
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,140
and verbal diarrhea that passes for popular music now.

334
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,260

335
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,660
But he then closes his video out with this.

336
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:29,500
["Popular Music"]

337
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,860
I mean, why not some nice violins instead, Paul?

338
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,260
You know, some Beethoven, maybe.

339
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,100
So, what's my conclusion here?

340
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,340
Well, Paul, do you want to come for a drink, man?

341
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,500
You know, get out the house a bit.

342
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,820
I think you've got cabin fever, dude.

343
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,660
It's not healthy, and this is a genuine offer, by the way.

344
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,060
I will actually get the train down and take you for a drink if you're up for it.

345
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,820
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

346
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,540
Remember to like and subscribe if you feel like, and follow me on Twitter,

347
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,940
even though I mainly just talk a load of nonsense.

348
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,660
Um, and if you'd like more videos like this,

349
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,460
consider pledging me a dollar over on Patreon.

350
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,580
We're more than halfway to our next milestone over there,

351
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,620
and would you believe it, I'm very excited about the whole thing.

352
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:20,060
The generosity of my supporters has blown me away, and now I am dead.

353
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,540
Anyway, see you next time.
