0	1280	Hello, everyone.
1280	7040	I'd like today to talk about a news story that happened only recently, but be warned.
7040	12320	It's a news story so outrageous and infuriating that, just by hearing it,
12320	18160	you're likely to enter into a fit of possibly fatal fury and anger.
18160	22080	During New Year's Eve celebrations in Dortmund, Germany,
22080	27840	a 1,000-strong mob of Muslim immigrant men attacked the police
27920	31440	and set Germany's oldest church on fire.
31440	33040	Can you believe that?
33040	38000	The audacity of these foreign bastards, honestly.
38000	41120	It's always the way with these immigrant types, isn't it?
41120	44800	Germany's kind and gracious enough to offer them a home,
44800	48080	and the first thing they do is go about attacking the police
48080	51280	and burning the oldest church in the country.
51280	52560	Typical.
52560	56320	Now, the only thing that could make this story even more insulting and outrageous
56320	59920	is if anything that I just said were actually true.
60560	63840	You see, the events I just mentioned didn't really take place.
63840	66880	It was all made up, almost out of thin air,
66880	72320	but you wouldn't know that if you were reading brightbard.com on the 3rd of January
72320	76880	because that website reported all of those events as true.
77600	79600	So what's the actual truth here?
79600	82560	Well, during New Year's Eve celebrations in Dortmund,
82560	87840	a stray firework did light some scaffold netting on fire next to a church,
88480	92160	which isn't actually even Germany's oldest church, by the way,
92160	96320	but the netting was extinguished about ten minutes later
96320	98560	with no actual damage to the church.
99280	103600	And here's some current pictures of that church taken just the other day,
103600	106720	kindly provided by one of my subscribers in Germany.
107600	110160	And as you can see, it's very much still there.
110160	114000	And here's the extent of the fire damage.
114000	115360	Would you look at that?
115360	119120	Now, in Germany's ongoing migrant arson epidemic,
119120	123120	I'd say that this ranks right alongside the time that guy burned his toast.
123840	128560	So anyway, the abject horror of some singed scaffold netting aside,
129360	131520	why am I talking about this story?
132160	137760	Well, this sort of overblown, hysterical reporting of a minor incident
137760	140960	is something that I've been noticing more and more lately.
140960	145040	Now, maybe I just haven't been paying enough attention up till now,
145040	149920	or maybe folks are just being more blatant with their propaganda these days.
150640	153920	I don't know, it's probably a bit of both, to be honest.
153920	156560	Regardless, I'm noticing it now.
157200	159280	And there's a pattern to this sort of thing.
160000	164640	Firstly, some dreadful site like Breitbart or some tabloid newspaper
164720	168480	will publish a completely morally outrageous story
168480	174560	that is either entirely made up or exaggerated to the point of absurdity.
174560	178080	Then the story will do the rounds on Twitter and Facebook and the likes.
178080	181280	And of course, some of my YouTube pals will do their bit
181280	184080	to make sure it reaches all of their subscribers.
184720	187840	So what I want to do today is take a look at a few of these stories.
187840	192640	We'll take a look at the initial reporting, the reactions to it on YouTube,
192720	195760	and also, with the benefit of hindsight,
195760	199120	we'll re-examine the stories and check for later developments
199760	202800	and therefore see if all the fuss was justified.
202800	208000	And the first case I want to look at concerns Thomas Salby, the balcony man.
208640	212880	On the 22nd of July, 2016, as you might be aware,
212880	220960	a teenager called Ali David Somboli shot nine people at a McDonald's in Munich, Germany.
221520	224320	Shortly afterwards, a man called Thomas Salby
224320	228480	shouted at and insulted Somboli from the balcony of his apartment
228480	230880	and he also threw a beer bottle at him.
230880	233600	The argument was captured on video by a neighbor
233600	237280	and Salby was generally celebrated for standing up to the shooter.
237920	242560	Shortly thereafter, however, someone reported Thomas Salby to the police
242560	246000	for insulting the shooter, using the justification
246000	250480	that provoking someone who has a gun is probably rather stupid.
250560	253040	And so the police opened an investigation.
254080	257280	A very short investigation, as it turns out.
257840	260720	You see, the prosecutors very quickly came to the conclusion
260720	265440	that the person reporting Salby to the police had the order of events wrong.
265440	270400	In the opinion of public prosecutor Thomas Steinkraus Koch,
270400	274880	whoever reported Salby must have thought that his insulting of Somboli
274880	279840	happened before the shootings took place and was therefore a possible trigger for them.
279840	282800	But actually, the exchange happened after the shootings
282800	286560	and Somboli didn't kill anyone else afterwards except himself.
286560	291600	And happily enough for Salby, in the opinion of the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office,
291600	296480	the argument could have actually distracted the shooter from pursuing further targets.
297040	300480	And as such, they announced that they were going to drop the investigation.
301280	308960	They told this to the Munich-based newspaper TZ on the 4th of August, 2016.
308960	311040	That's important, as it turns out.
311040	315200	Now there's a few more dates to come, so I'm gonna mark this on a little calendar here
315200	318000	so we can keep track of everything. So there we go.
318000	323280	On the 4th of August, 2016, the prosecutors told a local newspaper
323280	328160	that the investigation into Thomas Salby was going to be dropped.
328160	330080	And so that's the end of that, right?
330080	333840	Salby's case was investigated, he was found to have done nothing wrong,
333840	336880	prosecutors announced the case is being dropped.
336880	337380	The end.
338180	338740	You'd think.
339620	345940	You see, the very next day, on the 5th of August, the following story appeared on Breitbart.com.
346500	351780	Balcony man who stood up to Munich shooter to face prosecution for insulting the dead.
352740	356820	The Munich resident who hurled insults at shooter Ali David Somboli
356820	360980	as he was carrying out an attack on a shopping mall has been accused of libel,
360980	362820	the Munich prosecutor has announced.
363380	368820	Now what Breitbart don't report in this story is that that same Munich Public Prosecutor's Office
368820	372980	had already announced to the press that they would be dropping the investigation,
372980	378740	because why let a little detail like that get in the way of such a great source of outraged clicks?
379300	382900	And while you're here, remember to visit the official Breitbart store
382900	387060	and buy a t-shirt and a really stupid belt buckle.
387060	389220	Now on the same day as this Breitbart story,
389220	393700	there was a very similar story on the website of the British newspaper, The Express.
394820	400500	Brave man who stood up to Munich shooter now facing prosecution for insulting killer.
400500	406180	And this story, like the Breitbart one, neglects to mention that the case was already being dropped.
407060	408660	So what do we think here?
408660	414100	Is it just a case of very lazy journalists not checking the facts on the stories they're writing,
414100	416740	or is it a deliberate lie by omission?
417460	421220	Only reporting the first half of the story on purpose,
421220	425060	because it paints a picture of an ultra-PC German state
425060	428820	that will punish a patriotic man just for insulting a murderer.
429620	430740	Who knows?
430740	436500	And I'd just like to briefly highlight a comment on the Breitbart article by user Snortripper.
436500	439620	Okay, this is really poor reporting by Breitbart here.
439620	443780	I've taken a run through the German press and what happened was someone reported Mr. Salby
443780	447700	thinking his shouting insults at somebody had actually provoked the killings,
447700	449940	not knowing they'd already taken place.
449940	452580	The Munich state prosecutors dropped the case,
452580	455620	so either a deliberate clickbait article by BBL,
455620	457540	that's Breitbart London,
457540	459300	to get everybody frothing or just,
460180	463300	huh, another drop in quality control.
463300	466020	Now this comment was posted on August 5th,
466020	471620	the same date the story was published and is one of the highest rated comments on the article.
471620	476900	So, for instance, if you were someone making a YouTube video featuring the story
476900	478260	several weeks later,
478900	484820	even a cursory glance at the comment section would reveal that the story is a load of rubbish.
484820	485700	And speaking of...
486340	490260	During the mass shooting in Munich on the 22nd of July 2016
490260	494260	that took the lives of nine people and wounded 36 others,
494260	499140	Thomas Salby, a 57-year-old German man, hurled abuse at the shooter,
499140	501860	Ali Sonboli, from his balcony,
501860	507940	while many praised Mr. Salby for standing up to the gunman who aimed shots in his direction.
507940	513300	He was charged by the Munich prosecutor for liable for his comments.
513300	519700	During the deadly attack, he repeatedly called the gunman a wanker and told him to fuck off.
519700	521700	All I had was a beer bottle to throw at him,
521700	526100	but if I had a gun I would have shot him in the head, the Munich residents said.
526100	532660	German prosecutors are investigating Salby for potentially insulting the 18-year-old gunman
533300	537780	who shot himself after the massacre, and he will most likely have to pay a fine.
538740	539240	Uh...
540180	540680	No.
541060	543460	So that was Black Pigeon Speaks there,
543460	548020	quoting both Breitbart and the Express on the 26th of August.
548020	551940	So Black Pigeon had a few weeks to check out his sources there,
551940	555140	but apparently neglected to.
555220	560500	And Black Pigeon was by no means the only YouTuber tricked by these tabloid shenanigans.
560500	564500	So we're gonna have a significant change of pace from annoying first world women
564500	566660	to the Munich shooter.
566660	570980	Specifically how a man who stood up and shouted at the guy from a balcony
570980	574100	is now facing prosecution for insulting the killer.
574660	578020	That's a chap called Sargon of Akkad there,
578020	582500	sharing the Express story in his ongoing series with the self-fulfilling title,
583140	584740	This Week in Stupid.
584740	588420	Now, Sargon shared the story on only the 7th of August,
588420	592420	so well done, Sargon, for being quick off the mark with that one.
592420	595380	In fact, I'll somewhat let Sargon off the hook here.
595380	597700	In his segment on the Express article,
597700	601780	he is far more interested in laughing at how bad a newspaper the Express is
601780	605140	than talking about the actual story itself.
605140	610020	But he still shares the story, so Sargon gets an honorable mention here.
610020	613300	And bringing up the rear, we've got an old friend of the show.
614260	616900	A brave man who stood up to the Munich shooter
616900	621460	now facing prosecution for insulting the killer.
622660	625940	Because this is the world in which we live right now.
627140	630740	Someone can be gunning people down in the street,
632100	636740	and you're not allowed to basically look at them and say,
636740	638260	you're being a bit of a wanker, mate.
639060	642340	You can't do that, because then you're insulting someone
642900	646260	who is higher than you on the progressive stack,
646260	650420	and therefore you are the one who is doing it wrong.
651140	654820	Because that makes perfect fucking sense, right?
655860	658260	He said, all I had was a beer bottle to throw at him,
658260	662020	but if I had a gun, I would have shot him in the head.
662900	666580	And this is the appropriate reaction to have
666580	670820	when someone is massacring innocent people in the middle of your city.
671380	674420	Just doing, just getting them out of the way,
674420	677540	bringing an end to everything, that's a wonderful thing.
677540	684660	Except for if you're offending the religion of peace.
685460	690500	You can't do that, because that's just not fucking allowed, right?
691140	694900	So that's Tealdea there, talking about the express story
694900	699540	on a live stream on his channel on the 2nd of September.
699540	702100	So almost a month late to the party there.
702660	705140	And I feel for Tealdea a little bit, to be honest.
705140	707940	I mean, we can hardly expect him to keep pace
707940	710980	with an intellectual powerhouse like Sargon of Akkad.
711700	715780	Funnily enough, however, a little later in his live stream,
715780	718020	someone in the chat points out to Tealdea
718020	720260	that he doesn't have the full story.
720260	721700	And Tealdea responds.
722980	724580	A lot of people in the chat talking about feelings,
724580	726260	someone's just saying, it's fucked up.
726260	727780	Yeah, yeah, pretty much is.
728340	731700	Someone pointing out, someone saying, seriously,
731700	734020	you don't have the full story about it.
734020	735860	I don't really very much care.
736580	739780	And also, well, first of all, I don't really very much care.
739780	742820	Streams are for entertainment, not for being entirely factual.
742820	744580	And second of all, this is something
744580	747220	from the very beginning of August, about a month ago.
747940	750100	There is quite possibly information
750100	751700	that's come out since then.
751700	755300	Again, don't care, something called entertainment.
756100	757140	Ta-da!
757140	759380	Blew your fucking mind right there, didn't I?
760180	761620	Uh, yes.
762580	763380	Yes, you did.
763940	766420	And as a little postscript to this segment,
766420	769700	I'd like to have a bit of a think about Tealdea's comment
769700	771460	about the religion of peace.
772020	774980	Now that's a sarcastic jab at Islam there,
774980	776340	and this reminded me of something
776340	778420	in the Breitbart article near the bottom.
778420	780980	They start talking about a Pegida march.
780980	783540	That's the patriotic Europeans
783540	786100	against the Islamization of the West group.
786820	790980	Now why are Breitbart or Tealdea talking about Islam?
791620	795300	Ali David Somboli, the Munich shooter, was not a Muslim.
796020	797860	He was also not an immigrant.
797860	799620	He was born in Germany.
799620	802260	He idolized Anders Breivik.
802260	806500	He staged his shooting on the anniversary of Breivik's shooting.
806500	809380	He was, like, super not a Muslim.
809380	814740	And yet he automatically gets lumped in with actual Islamic terrorists.
815300	816420	For some reason.
817140	823780	And I wonder why that is, he said, facetiously knowing the answer.
824740	827300	So anyway, let's move on to our next story.
827300	831140	And this one concerns the Isle of Bute in Scotland.
831140	835620	So in December of 2015, 15 Syrian refugee families
835620	838740	were relocated to the Scottish island of Bute.
839620	840120	Bute?
840740	842180	I think that's how you say it.
842900	847860	And in February of 2016, something terrible happened.
848580	853700	UK police arrest man for offensive Facebook post about migrants.
854260	857220	British police have promised not to tolerate any speech
857220	861220	that could cause offence on social media regarding Syrian migrants
861220	865940	after arresting a man for Facebook comments made about recent arrivals
865940	868180	on his small Scottish island.
868180	871220	The tiny Isle of Bute in the Firth of Clyde,
871220	876260	which has a total population of just 6,498 in 2011,
876260	880100	is expected to take in around 1,000 Syrian migrants,
880660	884100	with 12 families already arriving since December last year.
884740	885540	Picture above.
886100	891220	Now, I'm as excited as the next guy to be outraged about this offence to free speech,
891220	893700	but I have to pause a moment here.
893700	897140	Bute is going to take in 1,000 Syrian migrants?
897940	901460	I'm very sorry to Breitbart there, but that's not true.
901460	905860	You see, if we click their link for the source about the 1,000 Syrian migrants,
905860	909780	we're taken to an express story from the 6th of December,
909780	914420	which says they are among the first of about 1,000 refugees
914420	920180	who are to be relocated around the west central area of Scotland.
920180	924820	So 1,000 refugees are being relocated to central Scotland in general.
925620	928020	Not this one island specifically.
928020	930980	Only 15 families were relocated to Bute,
930980	935220	so unless all of those families have an average of 60-plus members each,
935220	939860	I doubt Breitbart's 1,000 figure is entirely accurate.
939860	944100	So how many refugees in total were actually sent to Bute?
944100	947380	More families are set to arrive on Bute over the next few weeks,
947380	952980	which will bring the total to 28 adults and 31 children.
952980	959620	So 59. I mean, that's okay Breitbart, you were only 941 off.
960260	964260	Anyway, uh, sorry about that, let's get back to the outrage, shall we?
965380	972100	However, commenting on the comparatively huge and sudden influx of Muslim immigrants online
972100	975380	just became a very risky business for local residents.
976260	980020	Police have confirmed they've arrested a 41-year-old local man
980020	985540	under the Communications Act after receiving a report of a supposedly
986500	992180	offensive comment made on Facebook regarding the migrants.
992180	993620	So isn't that awful?
993620	999060	You simply comment on the migrants' arrivals, completely neutrally and non-offensively of course,
999060	1002260	and you end up arrested and thrown in jail.
1002900	1007060	George Orwell's 1984 has finally come true.
1007700	1009860	Rally, my YouTube brothers.
1010420	1012740	Don't let this injustice stand.
1012740	1020420	A man was arrested in Scotland over offensive social media posts directed at Syrian refugees.
1021300	1025540	And now there's a guy got arrested for Facebook posts about Syrian refugees in Scotland,
1025540	1030340	which is, you know, at first I kind of panicked about this because we had millennial woes on,
1030340	1032420	and, you know, he describes himself as a Scottish guy.
1032420	1036420	I'm like, Jesus Christ, let me find out that, let me find out it was him.
1036420	1043220	A man has got arrested for Facebook posts about the Syrian refugees in Scotland,
1043220	1047380	and this is something that would normally shock me.
1047380	1052500	However, due to the fact that I operate this channel and every day I talk about similar news,
1052500	1056420	it's now like, eh, it was bound to happen sooner or later.
1056420	1060900	Police in Scotland have said the arrest of a man responsible for a series of offensive Facebook
1060900	1065780	posts about Syrian refugees should send a clear message that such social media abuse
1065780	1067540	will not be tolerated.
1067540	1074100	Should send a clear message that such social media abuse will not be tolerated.
1074100	1080020	Should send a clear message that such a social media abuse will not be tolerated.
1080020	1082900	We will not tolerate your criticism of this group.
1083620	1086180	These people are beyond reproach.
1086180	1088740	I consider myself kind of a free speech absolutist.
1089300	1093940	I really agree with case law in the US on freedom of speech.
1093940	1101460	The very, very rare exceptions to freedom of speech are basically direct threats of violence.
1101460	1103300	Freedom of expression and opinion.
1103300	1107140	Well, outside of the US, that's also a thing of the past.
1107140	1110180	Post your disgruntlement of the government's policies
1110180	1113620	and you will be arrested in many countries in the West.
1113620	1122180	So let's see what exactly did the person say, which I guess required the police to burst in,
1122180	1125220	because it was probably a crime being committed there, right?
1125220	1129380	Now, we don't have any specific information on what was said in the post.
1130820	1132180	Wait, what?
1132900	1134180	We don't know what he said.
1134900	1137620	Well, okay, I mean, from how everyone is acting,
1137620	1142580	I'd assume that the man had just politely disagreed with the government's immigration policies.
1142580	1148020	I mean, everyone has a right to free speech, but as YouTube channel Secular Talk points out,
1148020	1151620	that doesn't cover threatening people or inciting violence.
1151620	1156260	I mean, this guy could have been threatening to cut the refugees' heads off for all we know.
1156260	1158260	So why don't we know what he said?
1158260	1160180	Well, when these YouTube videos were made,
1160180	1163460	what the man said on Facebook wasn't actually publicly known,
1163460	1166180	which might lead a more critical person than me to comment
1166180	1169700	that they'd all unnecessarily jumped the gun a little bit.
1169700	1172420	So with the benefit of living in the future,
1172420	1177780	let's cheat a bit and go back in time and see what the guy actually said.
1177780	1182980	And this is the Scottish Daily Mail from the 26th of May, 2016,
1182980	1187380	commenting on the man's, that is, Scott Clark's, appearance in court.
1188020	1189380	And would you believe it?
1189380	1193860	A journalist actually did some journalism and went and dug up his comments,
1193860	1197940	which were posted to the Facebook page of the Scottish Defence League.
1197940	1199140	And let's see what he said.
1200660	1205140	Islamic invasion on Bute, refugees were in a local boozer,
1205140	1207380	all pissed, I assume.
1208420	1210900	They're dirty, they're savages.
1210900	1212660	He said he'd cut their heads off.
1213460	1214500	Oh, would you look at that?
1214500	1217540	He did say that he'd cut the refugees' heads off.
1217540	1218420	What a surprise.
1220180	1221700	But I should come clean a bit here.
1221700	1226260	When I earlier postulated cutting the refugees' heads off
1226260	1228580	as something that Scott Clark may have said,
1229780	1232020	I was cheating a bit there, but I knew.
1232020	1232900	I knew what he'd said.
1232900	1234820	I'd already read this news story.
1235220	1237300	I script out the whole video in advance.
1238580	1242260	It's a little technique I learned from Behring,
1242260	1247860	where what you do is you pretend to anticipate what's coming up in your own video,
1247860	1250740	and it makes you seem clever, apparently.
1252420	1253140	Oh, well.
1253140	1254100	What else did he say?
1254900	1257700	There's definitely something going down on this island,
1257700	1260100	and when it does these Fs,
1260180	1265140	we'll see the nasty side to us who have opposed their arrival from the start.
1266180	1270740	Other comments were too explicit to be printed in a family newspaper,
1270740	1274500	so apparently the decapitations were just a start.
1274500	1276900	So what's the lesson from this story?
1276900	1282900	Well, I'd say maybe wait until all the facts are in about an ongoing police investigation
1282900	1286740	before you prematurely declare the death of free speech.
1287540	1289780	It's not the catchiest lesson, I agree,
1289780	1293460	but, you know, let's move on.
1293460	1299860	So next up, we've got two very similar stories about German tattoos and Swedish wristbands,
1299860	1302580	and we'll do the Germans first, because why not?
1303220	1304180	I'm not making this up.
1304180	1305700	This is not satire.
1305700	1307220	Here's the story in Die Welt.
1308260	1311220	Do you see that young girl, probably around 12 years old,
1311220	1317060	she is wearing a temporary tattoo on her shoulder that says no,
1317700	1320580	and it has angel wings on it or something.
1320580	1328420	And as the story explains, it's a signal to Muslim men that means no, don't rape me.
1328420	1332340	And here's a local politician who is so proud of this solution.
1332340	1339060	She's got a poster of a baby girl, a baby, for crying out loud, that says no, not with me.
1340580	1343940	This is the solution to Muslim migrants sexually assaulting German girls?
1344660	1346660	Have a temporary tattoo that says no?
1347540	1352500	Just in case the screaming girl shouting no when she's being raped isn't enough,
1352500	1356660	maybe the tattoo will be the thing that stops a rapist from raping.
1357460	1360100	Look at how proud that politician was, eh?
1360100	1364500	Young girls at German swimming pools are now being given temporary tattoos with the word no
1365140	1368260	on them in the attempt to put off rapists.
1368260	1373380	The stick-on messages say no in German and English, but strangely not in Arabic.
1373460	1377940	And officials hope they will lead to a fall in sexual assaults at public baths.
1377940	1382740	That was YouTube channels, Black Pigeon Speaks, and Rebel Media.
1382740	1386340	They're talking about a hilariously ineffectual campaign
1386340	1390900	to apparently stop Muslim migrants sexually harassing people in pools.
1391540	1394420	And they're quoting a Mail Online article which says,
1395060	1400740	Young girls at German swimming pools are being given temporary tattoos with the word no on them
1400740	1402740	in an attempt to put off rapists.
1403380	1406100	The stick-on messages say no in German and English,
1406100	1410340	and officials hope they will lead to a fall in sexual assaults at public baths.
1410340	1416180	The new move comes after increased fears of sex attacks by migrants in the country.
1416180	1420980	However, authorities say the problem has long existed in Germany's pools.
1420980	1426820	Now the phrase, the new move comes after increased fears of sex attacks by migrants,
1426820	1430020	is an absolutely wonderful little bit of deception there,
1430020	1434900	because it leads readers to assume that the temporary tattoo initiative was a response
1435540	1440020	to migrant sexual abuse in pools, when in fact, it was not.
1440020	1445140	Now the Mail Online article was published on the 23rd of August, 2016,
1445140	1451220	and is quoting a news story from German news website Welt.de.
1451220	1452260	Welt? Welt?
1453620	1454580	German.
1454580	1457940	YouTube channel Rebel Media showed this article
1457940	1462740	and completely lied about it, as it turns out in their video.
1463460	1465300	You see, if we look at this article,
1465300	1469940	we see the women's and family representative of the district in which the tattoos were launched,
1469940	1472260	Veronika Vasha Gogirla,
1473060	1477780	saying that the tattoo initiative has nothing at all to do with migrants or Muslims.
1478340	1480980	It's completely independent, she says.
1480980	1484500	Sexual harassment in swimming pools has always been the case.
1484660	1489780	Rebel Media did not choose to translate this quote, strangely enough.
1489780	1493540	You see, the temporary tattoos are just an awareness-raising campaign
1493540	1496980	to get people talking about the issue of sexual harassment,
1496980	1500660	and like, a way to introduce the concept to children, I guess.
1500660	1503220	It's got shit all to do with migrants.
1503220	1507780	In fact, that Welt.de story quotes the German Interior Ministry,
1507780	1509380	saying that over the last five years,
1509380	1514020	the number of sexual assaults in swimming pools has not significantly changed.
1514100	1515780	What actually happened here is,
1515780	1521060	one German district started an awareness-raising campaign about sexual harassment,
1521060	1525060	and some news organizations knew they could get outraged clicks
1525060	1529140	if they awkwardly forced the migrant issue into the story.
1529140	1534260	Migrants plus sexual abuse sells papers and gets clicks.
1534260	1537380	So if all you've got is a story about sexual abuse,
1537380	1540900	you just jam the migrant angle in any way you can.
1541540	1544660	Speaking of, let's do the Swedish wristbands.
1544660	1548980	And this one is just a straight retelling of the tattoo story, truth be told.
1548980	1551780	This one even has a Snopes page, handily enough.
1552420	1553540	What's true?
1553540	1556660	Police in Sweden are distributing colored bracelets
1556660	1559060	as a means of engaging young people
1559060	1562100	and raising awareness about unwanted sexual offenses.
1562820	1564660	However, what's false,
1564660	1568020	Swedish police did not create or distribute the bracelets
1568020	1571460	in an attempt to dissuade refugees from raping Swedish women.
1572020	1575940	It's just another awareness-raising campaign that's been co-opted
1575940	1580500	and had an anti-immigrant message completely baselessly tied to it.
1580500	1584420	However, BlackPigeonSpeaks would have been unlikely to notice this
1584420	1588900	because he already has some rather particular notions about Sweden.
1589460	1592180	The signs of decline are already observable.
1592180	1594900	While many countries are sliding into social decline,
1594900	1599620	the canary in the coal mine is the self-described humanitarian superpower
1599620	1602500	that pursues a feminist foreign policy.
1602500	1606900	When looking at Sweden, it's one of the most gender-equal countries on Earth.
1606900	1609700	And while they've become the rape capital of Europe,
1609700	1612980	they're flushing their culture and country down the toilet
1612980	1615940	and pressing forward in their civilizational suicide
1615940	1617940	at an ever-accelerating pace.
1618500	1622420	So, Sweden has the rape capital of Europe,
1622420	1624340	they've let all the immigrants in,
1624340	1627460	and now they're going around raping everyone.
1627460	1629060	Is any of this true?
1629620	1634260	Well, Sweden does have the highest amount of reported rapes in Europe.
1634260	1637140	However, this is not necessarily a bad thing.
1638100	1638980	Stay with me now.
1640340	1645140	In fact, Sweden's high amount of reported rapes relative to the rest of Europe
1645140	1648100	is, in some respects, a good thing.
1648100	1652660	And if you're wondering how this could be, the key is in the word reported.
1653220	1654900	So let's think about this a bit more.
1655460	1659860	For starters, the idea that Sweden's relatively high number of reported rapes
1659860	1662980	is linked to some recent migrant influx
1662980	1668500	is countered by the fact that Sweden has, for a very long time, not just recently,
1668500	1672580	had a relatively high number of reported rapes relative to Europe.
1673140	1676580	The Wikipedia article on rape in Sweden says,
1676580	1682020	In 1996, Sweden registered almost three times the average number of rape offences
1682580	1685780	registered in 35 European countries.
1685780	1688580	So unless these recent migrants have time machines,
1688580	1693460	I don't think we can say they're solely to blame for Sweden's high number of reported rapes.
1693460	1699140	So if it's not down to recent migration, why is Sweden at the number one spot?
1699140	1702340	Well, for starters, Sweden has sex crime legislation
1702340	1706020	that has one of the most expansive definitions of rape in the world.
1706020	1710740	More things are classed as rape in Sweden, on average, than in the rest of Europe.
1710740	1713060	And this brings up an interesting point.
1713060	1716500	It's very difficult to compare crime rates across countries
1716500	1719540	that use different definitions of the crime.
1719540	1722980	For example, I'm quoting Wikipedia again here,
1722980	1725300	Unlike the majority of countries in Europe,
1725300	1730580	crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported,
1730580	1733300	at which point the classification may be unclear.
1734100	1736980	In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape,
1736980	1740580	it retains this classification in the published crime statistics,
1740580	1744900	even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven,
1744900	1750340	or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification.
1750340	1752500	And I'd like to ask a question here.
1752500	1759060	Let's say a woman goes to the police and says her husband has raped her every night for the last month.
1759780	1762340	Now, how would you record that crime?
1762340	1766660	Do you record that as one instance of rape but happening repeatedly,
1766660	1769460	or 30 separate rape crimes?
1769460	1775140	Now, depending on how you record it in the crime statistics, that's a difference of 30 times.
1775140	1780980	And of course, the Swedish police record every individual instance of rape as a separate offence.
1780980	1786180	My point is that two countries using two different methods of collecting crime data
1786180	1791860	could have wildly different crime statistics, even if the actual number of crimes is identical.
1791940	1798660	And also, by the way, a country that actively encourages people to come forward and report rape to the police
1798660	1801780	will have a higher instance of reported rapes.
1801780	1804820	But that's good. That's what they want to happen.
1804820	1807620	I mean, consider the alternative.
1807620	1815300	In 2010, an Amnesty International report highlighted that sexual violence happens in every single country,
1815300	1821700	and yet the official figures show that some countries like Hong Kong and Mongolia have zero cases reported.
1821700	1825620	And that's from a BBC article about the rape statistics in Sweden.
1826340	1831220	Now, I would ask anyone blaming migrants for Sweden's relatively high number of reported rapes
1831220	1835780	if they think that nobody was ever raped in Hong Kong or Mongolia because,
1835780	1839860	and I'm guessing here, I imagine that is probably not the case.
1840580	1846500	Anyway, that BBC article I quoted just there actually offers a very good explanation
1846500	1851380	of the various ways in which crime statistics can vary from country to country.
1851380	1858340	As a comparison, they show that Australia and Canada have a vastly above average number of kidnappings,
1858340	1860900	more than Colombia and Mexico,
1860900	1865780	but this isn't because Australia, for example, actually has more kidnappings than Mexico.
1866420	1872100	The disparity is explained by the different ways each country classifies and records the crime.
1872660	1873700	And I quote,
1873700	1876740	So why haven't we heard any of these horror stories?
1876740	1881300	Are people being grabbed off the street in Sydney and Toronto while the world turns a blind eye?
1881860	1882420	No.
1882420	1886900	The high numbers of kidnapping cases in these two countries are explained by the fact that
1886900	1891140	parental disputes over child custody are included in the figures.
1891940	1896980	If one parent takes a child for the weekend and the other parent objects and calls the police,
1896980	1899860	the incident will be recorded as a kidnapping.
1899860	1903620	Comparing crime rates across countries is fraught with difficulties.
1903620	1906500	This is well known among criminologists and stati-
1906500	1907940	sta- sta-
1907940	1913540	statisticians, less so among journalists and commentators.
1914100	1921140	Now, this BBC article is included in a Sargon of Akkad video called Sweden's Rape Culture,
1921140	1924500	talking about the high rate of reported rapes in Sweden,
1924500	1927780	in which Sargon pretty much blames it all on the migrants.
1928420	1932580	So, we know Black Pigeon Speaks is, to put it frankly,
1932580	1933780	a dishonest liar.
1933780	1937140	He completely doesn't care whether what he's saying is true.
1937140	1940580	If it supports his world view, he'll fall for any old shit.
1941460	1946100	Sargon of Akkad, however, has a reputation for being a step above all that.
1946100	1950740	So I thought it'd be interesting to see how Sargon navigates his way through an article
1950740	1953780	that actually contains a lot of counter-arguments to his.
1954340	1955140	Let's take a look.
1955780	1959460	Take, for example, this 2012 BBC piece on the subject.
1960020	1961700	The article begins as follows.
1962420	1966980	The Julian Assange extradition case has put Sweden's relatively high
1966980	1968980	incidence of rape under the spotlight,
1969540	1974020	but can such statistics reliably be compared from one country to another?
1974740	1977540	Which two countries are the kidnapping capitals of the world?
1978260	1979940	Australia and Canada.
1979940	1985460	Official figures from the UN show that there were 17 kidnaps per 100,000 people in Australia in 2010
1985460	1987380	and 12.7 in Canada.
1987380	1991220	That compares with only 0.6 in Colombia and 1.1 in Mexico.
1991780	1993620	Which is without a doubt fascinating,
1993620	1998340	but what does this have to do with Sweden's skyrocketing rape statistics?
1998900	2001540	The answer is, of course, nothing.
2001540	2005060	Because the author of this BBC article is a rape apologist
2005060	2008980	who feels the need to attempt to play down exactly how bad
2008980	2012740	the gang rape situation in Sweden actually is
2012740	2016020	by comparing it to financially motivated kidnappings.
2016660	2019860	We do eventually reach the actual point of the article though.
2020740	2023700	Sweden has the highest rape rate in Europe,
2023700	2027780	author Naomi Wolf said on the BBC's Newsnight program recently.
2027780	2029300	Is it true? Yes.
2029860	2033860	Ah, now you see Sargon cut out a few paragraphs there.
2033860	2038420	Paragraphs that explain why the kidnapping example is relevant.
2038420	2041540	He cut from here in the article to here.
2042180	2044500	And that's a little sneaky to be honest.
2044500	2047380	He reads out the start of the kidnapping example,
2047460	2052420	but gets bored and declares it irrelevant before he gets to the conclusion.
2052420	2056420	And having zeroed in on the one or two sentences he actually agrees with,
2056420	2061140	Sargon leaves the article and all of its explanatory context right there
2061140	2063700	and never returns to it in the video.
2063700	2066980	That's the Sargon of Akkad method of argument, I guess.
2066980	2071700	If you just pretend to fall asleep halfway through hearing the opposing arguments,
2071700	2072740	you'll never be wrong.
2073380	2075300	Now to be fair to Sargon here,
2075860	2081940	someone in his comments called Eric the Dread did point out all the explanations that Sargon missed.
2081940	2087060	And so Sargon made a part two to this video where he apologizes for his mistake
2087060	2089060	and then tries to explain his omission.
2089620	2092740	Although, to again be fair to Sargon somewhat,
2092740	2095860	even though his response is fairly selective and dishonest,
2096580	2098900	he didn't have to respond to the criticism.
2100100	2104660	So he gets a big gold star from me for bothering to reply.
2104660	2106100	Well done, Sargon.
2106100	2109220	I've gone quite easy on Sargon today, haven't I?
2109220	2110500	I don't know why.
2110500	2113140	I've apparently got a bit of a soft spot for the guy.
2113700	2118260	Anyway, we're wandering a little bit here, so let's get back on track.
2118260	2120740	So I'd like to wrap up with one more little story.
2120740	2125780	Now, I just called Black Pigeon Speaks a dishonest liar who'll fall for any old shit
2125780	2128100	without even doing a cursory Google search,
2128100	2132820	so I'd just like to back that up a little with the following example
2132820	2134340	from his video entitled,
2135060	2139700	Break Europe, Merkel and Her Migrants, What Comes Next?
2139700	2143780	So, who is this refugee with a scar on his face?
2144340	2148340	On the right side of the picture, he appears to just be a regular refugee,
2148900	2151620	but on the left, he's pictured holding a rifle,
2151620	2156580	the implication being he's therefore a terrorist or ISIS supporter or something.
2156580	2158980	So this was a viral image from a while back.
2159620	2161940	Someone posted it to Facebook with the caption,
2162740	2166820	Remember this guy posing in ISIS photos last year?
2166820	2168820	Now he's a refugee.
2168820	2170420	Are we suckers or what?
2171860	2175300	Well, yes, although not in the way that you meant.
2175860	2178580	You see, the guy in the photographs is quite well known.
2178580	2181940	He's actually a former Syrian rebel commander.
2181940	2185220	He fought against ISIS, not for them,
2185220	2189540	and yet here he is being misidentified as an ISIS fighter.
2190100	2193460	For some reason, some inexplicable reason,
2194340	2196500	he said again, facetiously.
2197540	2201220	And this is really what sets Black Pigeon Speaks apart from the rest of the crowd.
2201860	2205140	Most of them at least care about trying to be factual,
2205140	2208900	but Black Pigeon will share any old chain email
2208900	2213860	sent by a racist uncle level nonsense he can get his grubby little talons on.
2213860	2217300	What this is, is it's intellectual dishonesty.
2217940	2220420	So we went through quite a few news stories there.
2220980	2225540	A lot of misinterpretation, exaggeration, and lying by omission.
2225540	2228660	So one might wonder, why does this happen?
2229220	2231700	Well, I know why it happens on the media end.
2231700	2235140	They want to sell papers and get clicks and racism sells.
2235860	2238580	But what's the explanation on the consumer end?
2239220	2244180	How can people who pride themselves on being rational and intelligent and impartial
2244180	2247060	so easily fall for all this half-baked nonsense?
2247620	2250980	I think the answer might lie in the reaction that some people give
2250980	2253860	when these sorts of news stories are debunked.
2254420	2257380	They get angry and upset and disappointed.
2258100	2259140	But why?
2259140	2263460	I mean, if I thought some terrible crime or miscarriage of justice had happened,
2263460	2267140	and then someone provided me with evidence that this proved what I believed,
2267140	2268340	I'd be happy.
2268340	2272100	Because it would have meant that a crime didn't take place.
2272100	2276980	Some people, though, seem to be suffering from what I'm gonna call outrage addiction.
2277380	2282660	They need to be outraged and they react negatively when someone takes it away from them.
2282660	2284820	It's anger as entertainment.
2285460	2287700	And as Tealdea so candidly admitted,
2288260	2292100	being factually accurate isn't really necessary.
2292100	2294580	And you see all flavors of this behavior, you know.
2295300	2298820	Black people in the States, immigrants and Muslims in Europe,
2298820	2301700	it can be the Jews, the feminists, etc.
2301700	2306100	Whoever you want to hate, it's not hard to find examples of individuals in that group
2306100	2308180	doing bad things or committing crimes.
2308740	2312820	But what if they don't do enough bad things or commit enough crimes
2312820	2316260	to justify how outraged you want to be about them?
2316980	2323060	What if there aren't enough actually real news stories to sustain your anger year round?
2323060	2324900	Well, that's where Breitbart comes in.
2325780	2329460	One thousand angry Muslims burned Germany's oldest church.
2331060	2332420	Did they actually do that?
2333060	2337220	Well, I don't know, but it seems like something I imagine they probably do,
2337220	2339380	so that's close enough for me.
2340020	2342180	So that's about it for me today, folks.
2343300	2345140	Should we close with a joke, though?
2345140	2347460	Who wants to know something really funny?
2348740	2355300	A couple of weeks before the large group of angry Muslims didn't attack the church in Dortmund,
2355300	2361540	the church was actually attacked by a group of German right-wing extremists.
2362260	2370260	On December 16th, a group of what the news website Dortmund24 calls neo-Nazis occupied the church,
2370900	2375380	barricaded themselves inside, hung a banner from the church that said
2375380	2381460	stop Islamization and no shit, set off fireworks on the roof.
2385700	2388020	When police arrived to arrest the group,
2388020	2391220	they had to chainsaw through one of the doors to get them out.
2391620	2397220	Now, I didn't see much reporting of this in the English-speaking press, oddly enough.
2398260	2403220	I guess neo-Nazis don't sell as well as Islamic extremists or something.
2403220	2406820	I mean, can you imagine if a bunch of Muslims had occupied the church?
2406820	2408580	We'd never hear the fucking end of it.
2409220	2411380	There's a double standard in the press.
2412900	2418900	That's a bold statement there aimed at the five of you who hadn't already noticed that.
2419700	2421220	So that's kind of funny, isn't it?
2421540	2424980	The same church, even, like, two weeks beforehand.
2425620	2427060	It's madness.
2427060	2429060	Anyway, thanks for watching, everyone.
2429060	2434260	I'd like to thank all of my supporters over on Patreon, who should be scrolling by right now,
2434260	2438580	for being very kind and generous and enabling me to keep making videos.
2438580	2442260	So a big heartfelt thank you to all of the names here.
2443220	2445380	I love each and every one of you.
2445380	2449540	And I'd like in particular to thank at RuneMian on Twitter again,
2449540	2452980	who helped me out not only with translation work this time,
2452980	2457380	but also stopped by the church in Dortmund to take a few photos for me,
2457380	2461540	and also tipped me off to the earlier occupation of the church.
2462180	2464180	So thank you at RuneMian.
2464180	2467540	You win the incredibly helpful Person of the Month award.
2468100	2469700	Anyway, bye for now.
2469700	2484100	So yeah, you know, if you run out of bullets, you put a knife through somebody's eye to it.
