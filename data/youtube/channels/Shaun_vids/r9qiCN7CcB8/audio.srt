00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,040
I'd like today to talk about a news story that happened only recently, but be warned.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,320
It's a news story so outrageous and infuriating that, just by hearing it,

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,160
you're likely to enter into a fit of possibly fatal fury and anger.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,080
During New Year's Eve celebrations in Dortmund, Germany,

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,840
a 1,000-strong mob of Muslim immigrant men attacked the police

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,440
and set Germany's oldest church on fire.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,040
Can you believe that?

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,000
The audacity of these foreign bastards, honestly.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,120
It's always the way with these immigrant types, isn't it?

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,800
Germany's kind and gracious enough to offer them a home,

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,080
and the first thing they do is go about attacking the police

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,280
and burning the oldest church in the country.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,560
Typical.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,320
Now, the only thing that could make this story even more insulting and outrageous

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,920
is if anything that I just said were actually true.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,840
You see, the events I just mentioned didn't really take place.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
It was all made up, almost out of thin air,

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,320
but you wouldn't know that if you were reading brightbard.com on the 3rd of January

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,880
because that website reported all of those events as true.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
So what's the actual truth here?

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,560
Well, during New Year's Eve celebrations in Dortmund,

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,840
a stray firework did light some scaffold netting on fire next to a church,

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,160
which isn't actually even Germany's oldest church, by the way,

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,320
but the netting was extinguished about ten minutes later

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
with no actual damage to the church.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,600
And here's some current pictures of that church taken just the other day,

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,720
kindly provided by one of my subscribers in Germany.

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,160
And as you can see, it's very much still there.

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,000
And here's the extent of the fire damage.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,360
Would you look at that?

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,120
Now, in Germany's ongoing migrant arson epidemic,

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,120
I'd say that this ranks right alongside the time that guy burned his toast.

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,560
So anyway, the abject horror of some singed scaffold netting aside,

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,520
why am I talking about this story?

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,760
Well, this sort of overblown, hysterical reporting of a minor incident

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,960
is something that I've been noticing more and more lately.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,040
Now, maybe I just haven't been paying enough attention up till now,

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,920
or maybe folks are just being more blatant with their propaganda these days.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,920
I don't know, it's probably a bit of both, to be honest.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
Regardless, I'm noticing it now.

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
And there's a pattern to this sort of thing.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,640
Firstly, some dreadful site like Breitbart or some tabloid newspaper

44
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,480
will publish a completely morally outrageous story

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,560
that is either entirely made up or exaggerated to the point of absurdity.

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,080
Then the story will do the rounds on Twitter and Facebook and the likes.

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,280
And of course, some of my YouTube pals will do their bit

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,080
to make sure it reaches all of their subscribers.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,840
So what I want to do today is take a look at a few of these stories.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640
We'll take a look at the initial reporting, the reactions to it on YouTube,

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,760
and also, with the benefit of hindsight,

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,120
we'll re-examine the stories and check for later developments

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,800
and therefore see if all the fuss was justified.

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,000
And the first case I want to look at concerns Thomas Salby, the balcony man.

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,880
On the 22nd of July, 2016, as you might be aware,

56
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:40,960
a teenager called Ali David Somboli shot nine people at a McDonald's in Munich, Germany.

57
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,320
Shortly afterwards, a man called Thomas Salby

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,480
shouted at and insulted Somboli from the balcony of his apartment

59
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,880
and he also threw a beer bottle at him.

60
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,600
The argument was captured on video by a neighbor

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,280
and Salby was generally celebrated for standing up to the shooter.

62
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,560
Shortly thereafter, however, someone reported Thomas Salby to the police

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,000
for insulting the shooter, using the justification

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,480
that provoking someone who has a gun is probably rather stupid.

65
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
And so the police opened an investigation.

66
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,280
A very short investigation, as it turns out.

67
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,720
You see, the prosecutors very quickly came to the conclusion

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,440
that the person reporting Salby to the police had the order of events wrong.

69
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,400
In the opinion of public prosecutor Thomas Steinkraus Koch,

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,880
whoever reported Salby must have thought that his insulting of Somboli

71
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,840
happened before the shootings took place and was therefore a possible trigger for them.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,800
But actually, the exchange happened after the shootings

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,560
and Somboli didn't kill anyone else afterwards except himself.

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,600
And happily enough for Salby, in the opinion of the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office,

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,480
the argument could have actually distracted the shooter from pursuing further targets.

76
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,480
And as such, they announced that they were going to drop the investigation.

77
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,960
They told this to the Munich-based newspaper TZ on the 4th of August, 2016.

78
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,040
That's important, as it turns out.

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,200
Now there's a few more dates to come, so I'm gonna mark this on a little calendar here

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,000
so we can keep track of everything. So there we go.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,280
On the 4th of August, 2016, the prosecutors told a local newspaper

82
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,160
that the investigation into Thomas Salby was going to be dropped.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
And so that's the end of that, right?

84
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,840
Salby's case was investigated, he was found to have done nothing wrong,

85
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,880
prosecutors announced the case is being dropped.

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,380
The end.

87
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,740
You'd think.

88
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,940
You see, the very next day, on the 5th of August, the following story appeared on Breitbart.com.

89
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,780
Balcony man who stood up to Munich shooter to face prosecution for insulting the dead.

90
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,820
The Munich resident who hurled insults at shooter Ali David Somboli

91
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,980
as he was carrying out an attack on a shopping mall has been accused of libel,

92
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,820
the Munich prosecutor has announced.

93
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,820
Now what Breitbart don't report in this story is that that same Munich Public Prosecutor's Office

94
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,980
had already announced to the press that they would be dropping the investigation,

95
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,740
because why let a little detail like that get in the way of such a great source of outraged clicks?

96
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,900
And while you're here, remember to visit the official Breitbart store

97
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,060
and buy a t-shirt and a really stupid belt buckle.

98
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,220
Now on the same day as this Breitbart story,

99
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,700
there was a very similar story on the website of the British newspaper, The Express.

100
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,500
Brave man who stood up to Munich shooter now facing prosecution for insulting killer.

101
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,180
And this story, like the Breitbart one, neglects to mention that the case was already being dropped.

102
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,660
So what do we think here?

103
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,100
Is it just a case of very lazy journalists not checking the facts on the stories they're writing,

104
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,740
or is it a deliberate lie by omission?

105
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,220
Only reporting the first half of the story on purpose,

106
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,060
because it paints a picture of an ultra-PC German state

107
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,820
that will punish a patriotic man just for insulting a murderer.

108
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,740
Who knows?

109
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,500
And I'd just like to briefly highlight a comment on the Breitbart article by user Snortripper.

110
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,620
Okay, this is really poor reporting by Breitbart here.

111
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,780
I've taken a run through the German press and what happened was someone reported Mr. Salby

112
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,700
thinking his shouting insults at somebody had actually provoked the killings,

113
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,940
not knowing they'd already taken place.

114
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,580
The Munich state prosecutors dropped the case,

115
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,620
so either a deliberate clickbait article by BBL,

116
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,540
that's Breitbart London,

117
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,300
to get everybody frothing or just,

118
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,300
huh, another drop in quality control.

119
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,020
Now this comment was posted on August 5th,

120
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,620
the same date the story was published and is one of the highest rated comments on the article.

121
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,900
So, for instance, if you were someone making a YouTube video featuring the story

122
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,260
several weeks later,

123
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,820
even a cursory glance at the comment section would reveal that the story is a load of rubbish.

124
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,700
And speaking of...

125
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,260
During the mass shooting in Munich on the 22nd of July 2016

126
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,260
that took the lives of nine people and wounded 36 others,

127
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,140
Thomas Salby, a 57-year-old German man, hurled abuse at the shooter,

128
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,860
Ali Sonboli, from his balcony,

129
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,940
while many praised Mr. Salby for standing up to the gunman who aimed shots in his direction.

130
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,300
He was charged by the Munich prosecutor for liable for his comments.

131
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,700
During the deadly attack, he repeatedly called the gunman a wanker and told him to fuck off.

132
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
All I had was a beer bottle to throw at him,

133
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,100
but if I had a gun I would have shot him in the head, the Munich residents said.

134
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,660
German prosecutors are investigating Salby for potentially insulting the 18-year-old gunman

135
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,780
who shot himself after the massacre, and he will most likely have to pay a fine.

136
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,240
Uh...

137
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,680
No.

138
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,460
So that was Black Pigeon Speaks there,

139
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,020
quoting both Breitbart and the Express on the 26th of August.

140
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,940
So Black Pigeon had a few weeks to check out his sources there,

141
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,140
but apparently neglected to.

142
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,500
And Black Pigeon was by no means the only YouTuber tricked by these tabloid shenanigans.

143
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,500
So we're gonna have a significant change of pace from annoying first world women

144
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,660
to the Munich shooter.

145
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,980
Specifically how a man who stood up and shouted at the guy from a balcony

146
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,100
is now facing prosecution for insulting the killer.

147
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,020
That's a chap called Sargon of Akkad there,

148
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,500
sharing the Express story in his ongoing series with the self-fulfilling title,

149
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,740
This Week in Stupid.

150
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,420
Now, Sargon shared the story on only the 7th of August,

151
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,420
so well done, Sargon, for being quick off the mark with that one.

152
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,380
In fact, I'll somewhat let Sargon off the hook here.

153
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,700
In his segment on the Express article,

154
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,780
he is far more interested in laughing at how bad a newspaper the Express is

155
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,140
than talking about the actual story itself.

156
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,020
But he still shares the story, so Sargon gets an honorable mention here.

157
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,300
And bringing up the rear, we've got an old friend of the show.

158
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,900
A brave man who stood up to the Munich shooter

159
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,460
now facing prosecution for insulting the killer.

160
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,940
Because this is the world in which we live right now.

161
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,740
Someone can be gunning people down in the street,

162
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,740
and you're not allowed to basically look at them and say,

163
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,260
you're being a bit of a wanker, mate.

164
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,340
You can't do that, because then you're insulting someone

165
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,260
who is higher than you on the progressive stack,

166
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,420
and therefore you are the one who is doing it wrong.

167
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,820
Because that makes perfect fucking sense, right?

168
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,260
He said, all I had was a beer bottle to throw at him,

169
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,020
but if I had a gun, I would have shot him in the head.

170
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,580
And this is the appropriate reaction to have

171
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,820
when someone is massacring innocent people in the middle of your city.

172
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,420
Just doing, just getting them out of the way,

173
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,540
bringing an end to everything, that's a wonderful thing.

174
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:24,660
Except for if you're offending the religion of peace.

175
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,500
You can't do that, because that's just not fucking allowed, right?

176
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,900
So that's Tealdea there, talking about the express story

177
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,540
on a live stream on his channel on the 2nd of September.

178
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,100
So almost a month late to the party there.

179
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,140
And I feel for Tealdea a little bit, to be honest.

180
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,940
I mean, we can hardly expect him to keep pace

181
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,980
with an intellectual powerhouse like Sargon of Akkad.

182
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,780
Funnily enough, however, a little later in his live stream,

183
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,020
someone in the chat points out to Tealdea

184
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,260
that he doesn't have the full story.

185
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,700
And Tealdea responds.

186
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,580
A lot of people in the chat talking about feelings,

187
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,260
someone's just saying, it's fucked up.

188
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,780
Yeah, yeah, pretty much is.

189
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,700
Someone pointing out, someone saying, seriously,

190
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,020
you don't have the full story about it.

191
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,860
I don't really very much care.

192
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,780
And also, well, first of all, I don't really very much care.

193
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,820
Streams are for entertainment, not for being entirely factual.

194
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,580
And second of all, this is something

195
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,220
from the very beginning of August, about a month ago.

196
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,100
There is quite possibly information

197
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,700
that's come out since then.

198
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,300
Again, don't care, something called entertainment.

199
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,140
Ta-da!

200
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,380
Blew your fucking mind right there, didn't I?

201
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,620
Uh, yes.

202
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,380
Yes, you did.

203
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,420
And as a little postscript to this segment,

204
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,700
I'd like to have a bit of a think about Tealdea's comment

205
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,460
about the religion of peace.

206
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,980
Now that's a sarcastic jab at Islam there,

207
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,340
and this reminded me of something

208
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,420
in the Breitbart article near the bottom.

209
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,980
They start talking about a Pegida march.

210
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,540
That's the patriotic Europeans

211
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,100
against the Islamization of the West group.

212
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,980
Now why are Breitbart or Tealdea talking about Islam?

213
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,300
Ali David Somboli, the Munich shooter, was not a Muslim.

214
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,860
He was also not an immigrant.

215
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,620
He was born in Germany.

216
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,260
He idolized Anders Breivik.

217
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,500
He staged his shooting on the anniversary of Breivik's shooting.

218
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,380
He was, like, super not a Muslim.

219
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,740
And yet he automatically gets lumped in with actual Islamic terrorists.

220
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,420
For some reason.

221
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:43,780
And I wonder why that is, he said, facetiously knowing the answer.

222
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,300
So anyway, let's move on to our next story.

223
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,140
And this one concerns the Isle of Bute in Scotland.

224
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,620
So in December of 2015, 15 Syrian refugee families

225
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,740
were relocated to the Scottish island of Bute.

226
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,120
Bute?

227
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,180
I think that's how you say it.

228
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,860
And in February of 2016, something terrible happened.

229
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,700
UK police arrest man for offensive Facebook post about migrants.

230
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,220
British police have promised not to tolerate any speech

231
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,220
that could cause offence on social media regarding Syrian migrants

232
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,940
after arresting a man for Facebook comments made about recent arrivals

233
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,180
on his small Scottish island.

234
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,220
The tiny Isle of Bute in the Firth of Clyde,

235
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,260
which has a total population of just 6,498 in 2011,

236
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,100
is expected to take in around 1,000 Syrian migrants,

237
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,100
with 12 families already arriving since December last year.

238
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,540
Picture above.

239
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,220
Now, I'm as excited as the next guy to be outraged about this offence to free speech,

240
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,700
but I have to pause a moment here.

241
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,140
Bute is going to take in 1,000 Syrian migrants?

242
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm very sorry to Breitbart there, but that's not true.

243
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,860
You see, if we click their link for the source about the 1,000 Syrian migrants,

244
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,780
we're taken to an express story from the 6th of December,

245
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,420
which says they are among the first of about 1,000 refugees

246
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,180
who are to be relocated around the west central area of Scotland.

247
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,820
So 1,000 refugees are being relocated to central Scotland in general.

248
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,020
Not this one island specifically.

249
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,980
Only 15 families were relocated to Bute,

250
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,220
so unless all of those families have an average of 60-plus members each,

251
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,860
I doubt Breitbart's 1,000 figure is entirely accurate.

252
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,100
So how many refugees in total were actually sent to Bute?

253
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,380
More families are set to arrive on Bute over the next few weeks,

254
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,980
which will bring the total to 28 adults and 31 children.

255
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,620
So 59. I mean, that's okay Breitbart, you were only 941 off.

256
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,260
Anyway, uh, sorry about that, let's get back to the outrage, shall we?

257
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:12,100
However, commenting on the comparatively huge and sudden influx of Muslim immigrants online

258
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,380
just became a very risky business for local residents.

259
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,020
Police have confirmed they've arrested a 41-year-old local man

260
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,540
under the Communications Act after receiving a report of a supposedly

261
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,180
offensive comment made on Facebook regarding the migrants.

262
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,620
So isn't that awful?

263
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:39,060
You simply comment on the migrants' arrivals, completely neutrally and non-offensively of course,

264
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,260
and you end up arrested and thrown in jail.

265
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,060
George Orwell's 1984 has finally come true.

266
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,860
Rally, my YouTube brothers.

267
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,740
Don't let this injustice stand.

268
00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:00,420
A man was arrested in Scotland over offensive social media posts directed at Syrian refugees.

269
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,540
And now there's a guy got arrested for Facebook posts about Syrian refugees in Scotland,

270
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,340
which is, you know, at first I kind of panicked about this because we had millennial woes on,

271
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,420
and, you know, he describes himself as a Scottish guy.

272
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,420
I'm like, Jesus Christ, let me find out that, let me find out it was him.

273
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:23,220
A man has got arrested for Facebook posts about the Syrian refugees in Scotland,

274
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,380
and this is something that would normally shock me.

275
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,500
However, due to the fact that I operate this channel and every day I talk about similar news,

276
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,420
it's now like, eh, it was bound to happen sooner or later.

277
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,900
Police in Scotland have said the arrest of a man responsible for a series of offensive Facebook

278
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,780
posts about Syrian refugees should send a clear message that such social media abuse

279
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,540
will not be tolerated.

280
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:54,100
Should send a clear message that such social media abuse will not be tolerated.

281
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:00,020
Should send a clear message that such a social media abuse will not be tolerated.

282
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,900
We will not tolerate your criticism of this group.

283
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,180
These people are beyond reproach.

284
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,740
I consider myself kind of a free speech absolutist.

285
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,940
I really agree with case law in the US on freedom of speech.

286
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:21,460
The very, very rare exceptions to freedom of speech are basically direct threats of violence.

287
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,300
Freedom of expression and opinion.

288
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,140
Well, outside of the US, that's also a thing of the past.

289
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,180
Post your disgruntlement of the government's policies

290
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,620
and you will be arrested in many countries in the West.

291
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:42,180
So let's see what exactly did the person say, which I guess required the police to burst in,

292
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,220
because it was probably a crime being committed there, right?

293
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,380
Now, we don't have any specific information on what was said in the post.

294
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,180
Wait, what?

295
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,180
We don't know what he said.

296
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,620
Well, okay, I mean, from how everyone is acting,

297
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,580
I'd assume that the man had just politely disagreed with the government's immigration policies.

298
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:08,020
I mean, everyone has a right to free speech, but as YouTube channel Secular Talk points out,

299
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,620
that doesn't cover threatening people or inciting violence.

300
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,260
I mean, this guy could have been threatening to cut the refugees' heads off for all we know.

301
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,260
So why don't we know what he said?

302
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,180
Well, when these YouTube videos were made,

303
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,460
what the man said on Facebook wasn't actually publicly known,

304
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,180
which might lead a more critical person than me to comment

305
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,700
that they'd all unnecessarily jumped the gun a little bit.

306
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,420
So with the benefit of living in the future,

307
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,780
let's cheat a bit and go back in time and see what the guy actually said.

308
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,980
And this is the Scottish Daily Mail from the 26th of May, 2016,

309
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,380
commenting on the man's, that is, Scott Clark's, appearance in court.

310
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,380
And would you believe it?

311
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,860
A journalist actually did some journalism and went and dug up his comments,

312
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,940
which were posted to the Facebook page of the Scottish Defence League.

313
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,140
And let's see what he said.

314
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,140
Islamic invasion on Bute, refugees were in a local boozer,

315
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,380
all pissed, I assume.

316
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,900
They're dirty, they're savages.

317
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,660
He said he'd cut their heads off.

318
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,500
Oh, would you look at that?

319
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,540
He did say that he'd cut the refugees' heads off.

320
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,420
What a surprise.

321
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,700
But I should come clean a bit here.

322
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,260
When I earlier postulated cutting the refugees' heads off

323
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,580
as something that Scott Clark may have said,

324
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,020
I was cheating a bit there, but I knew.

325
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,900
I knew what he'd said.

326
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,820
I'd already read this news story.

327
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,300
I script out the whole video in advance.

328
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,260
It's a little technique I learned from Behring,

329
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,860
where what you do is you pretend to anticipate what's coming up in your own video,

330
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,740
and it makes you seem clever, apparently.

331
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,140
Oh, well.

332
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,100
What else did he say?

333
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,700
There's definitely something going down on this island,

334
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,100
and when it does these Fs,

335
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,140
we'll see the nasty side to us who have opposed their arrival from the start.

336
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,740
Other comments were too explicit to be printed in a family newspaper,

337
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,500
so apparently the decapitations were just a start.

338
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,900
So what's the lesson from this story?

339
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,900
Well, I'd say maybe wait until all the facts are in about an ongoing police investigation

340
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,740
before you prematurely declare the death of free speech.

341
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,780
It's not the catchiest lesson, I agree,

342
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,460
but, you know, let's move on.

343
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:39,860
So next up, we've got two very similar stories about German tattoos and Swedish wristbands,

344
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,580
and we'll do the Germans first, because why not?

345
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,180
I'm not making this up.

346
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,700
This is not satire.

347
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,220
Here's the story in Die Welt.

348
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,220
Do you see that young girl, probably around 12 years old,

349
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:57,060
she is wearing a temporary tattoo on her shoulder that says no,

350
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,580
and it has angel wings on it or something.

351
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:08,420
And as the story explains, it's a signal to Muslim men that means no, don't rape me.

352
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,340
And here's a local politician who is so proud of this solution.

353
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:19,060
She's got a poster of a baby girl, a baby, for crying out loud, that says no, not with me.

354
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,940
This is the solution to Muslim migrants sexually assaulting German girls?

355
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,660
Have a temporary tattoo that says no?

356
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:32,500
Just in case the screaming girl shouting no when she's being raped isn't enough,

357
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,660
maybe the tattoo will be the thing that stops a rapist from raping.

358
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,100
Look at how proud that politician was, eh?

359
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,500
Young girls at German swimming pools are now being given temporary tattoos with the word no

360
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,260
on them in the attempt to put off rapists.

361
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,380
The stick-on messages say no in German and English, but strangely not in Arabic.

362
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,940
And officials hope they will lead to a fall in sexual assaults at public baths.

363
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,740
That was YouTube channels, Black Pigeon Speaks, and Rebel Media.

364
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,340
They're talking about a hilariously ineffectual campaign

365
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,900
to apparently stop Muslim migrants sexually harassing people in pools.

366
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,420
And they're quoting a Mail Online article which says,

367
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,740
Young girls at German swimming pools are being given temporary tattoos with the word no on them

368
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,740
in an attempt to put off rapists.

369
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,100
The stick-on messages say no in German and English,

370
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,340
and officials hope they will lead to a fall in sexual assaults at public baths.

371
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:36,180
The new move comes after increased fears of sex attacks by migrants in the country.

372
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,980
However, authorities say the problem has long existed in Germany's pools.

373
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:46,820
Now the phrase, the new move comes after increased fears of sex attacks by migrants,

374
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,020
is an absolutely wonderful little bit of deception there,

375
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,900
because it leads readers to assume that the temporary tattoo initiative was a response

376
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,020
to migrant sexual abuse in pools, when in fact, it was not.

377
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,140
Now the Mail Online article was published on the 23rd of August, 2016,

378
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:11,220
and is quoting a news story from German news website Welt.de.

379
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,260
Welt? Welt?

380
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,580
German.

381
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,940
YouTube channel Rebel Media showed this article

382
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,740
and completely lied about it, as it turns out in their video.

383
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,300
You see, if we look at this article,

384
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,940
we see the women's and family representative of the district in which the tattoos were launched,

385
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,260
Veronika Vasha Gogirla,

386
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,780
saying that the tattoo initiative has nothing at all to do with migrants or Muslims.

387
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,980
It's completely independent, she says.

388
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,500
Sexual harassment in swimming pools has always been the case.

389
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,780
Rebel Media did not choose to translate this quote, strangely enough.

390
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,540
You see, the temporary tattoos are just an awareness-raising campaign

391
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,980
to get people talking about the issue of sexual harassment,

392
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,660
and like, a way to introduce the concept to children, I guess.

393
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,220
It's got shit all to do with migrants.

394
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,780
In fact, that Welt.de story quotes the German Interior Ministry,

395
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,380
saying that over the last five years,

396
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,020
the number of sexual assaults in swimming pools has not significantly changed.

397
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,780
What actually happened here is,

398
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:21,060
one German district started an awareness-raising campaign about sexual harassment,

399
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,060
and some news organizations knew they could get outraged clicks

400
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,140
if they awkwardly forced the migrant issue into the story.

401
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:34,260
Migrants plus sexual abuse sells papers and gets clicks.

402
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,380
So if all you've got is a story about sexual abuse,

403
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,900
you just jam the migrant angle in any way you can.

404
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,660
Speaking of, let's do the Swedish wristbands.

405
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,980
And this one is just a straight retelling of the tattoo story, truth be told.

406
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,780
This one even has a Snopes page, handily enough.

407
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,540
What's true?

408
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,660
Police in Sweden are distributing colored bracelets

409
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,060
as a means of engaging young people

410
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,100
and raising awareness about unwanted sexual offenses.

411
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,660
However, what's false,

412
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,020
Swedish police did not create or distribute the bracelets

413
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,460
in an attempt to dissuade refugees from raping Swedish women.

414
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,940
It's just another awareness-raising campaign that's been co-opted

415
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,500
and had an anti-immigrant message completely baselessly tied to it.

416
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,420
However, BlackPigeonSpeaks would have been unlikely to notice this

417
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,900
because he already has some rather particular notions about Sweden.

418
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,180
The signs of decline are already observable.

419
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,900
While many countries are sliding into social decline,

420
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,620
the canary in the coal mine is the self-described humanitarian superpower

421
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,500
that pursues a feminist foreign policy.

422
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,900
When looking at Sweden, it's one of the most gender-equal countries on Earth.

423
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,700
And while they've become the rape capital of Europe,

424
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,980
they're flushing their culture and country down the toilet

425
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,940
and pressing forward in their civilizational suicide

426
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,940
at an ever-accelerating pace.

427
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,420
So, Sweden has the rape capital of Europe,

428
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,340
they've let all the immigrants in,

429
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,460
and now they're going around raping everyone.

430
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,060
Is any of this true?

431
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,260
Well, Sweden does have the highest amount of reported rapes in Europe.

432
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,140
However, this is not necessarily a bad thing.

433
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,980
Stay with me now.

434
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,140
In fact, Sweden's high amount of reported rapes relative to the rest of Europe

435
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,100
is, in some respects, a good thing.

436
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,660
And if you're wondering how this could be, the key is in the word reported.

437
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,900
So let's think about this a bit more.

438
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,860
For starters, the idea that Sweden's relatively high number of reported rapes

439
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,980
is linked to some recent migrant influx

440
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,500
is countered by the fact that Sweden has, for a very long time, not just recently,

441
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,580
had a relatively high number of reported rapes relative to Europe.

442
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,580
The Wikipedia article on rape in Sweden says,

443
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:02,020
In 1996, Sweden registered almost three times the average number of rape offences

444
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,780
registered in 35 European countries.

445
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,580
So unless these recent migrants have time machines,

446
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,460
I don't think we can say they're solely to blame for Sweden's high number of reported rapes.

447
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:19,140
So if it's not down to recent migration, why is Sweden at the number one spot?

448
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,340
Well, for starters, Sweden has sex crime legislation

449
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,020
that has one of the most expansive definitions of rape in the world.

450
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,740
More things are classed as rape in Sweden, on average, than in the rest of Europe.

451
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,060
And this brings up an interesting point.

452
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,500
It's very difficult to compare crime rates across countries

453
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,540
that use different definitions of the crime.

454
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,980
For example, I'm quoting Wikipedia again here,

455
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,300
Unlike the majority of countries in Europe,

456
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,580
crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported,

457
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,300
at which point the classification may be unclear.

458
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,980
In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape,

459
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,580
it retains this classification in the published crime statistics,

460
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,900
even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven,

461
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:10,340
or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification.

462
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,500
And I'd like to ask a question here.

463
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:19,060
Let's say a woman goes to the police and says her husband has raped her every night for the last month.

464
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,340
Now, how would you record that crime?

465
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,660
Do you record that as one instance of rape but happening repeatedly,

466
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,460
or 30 separate rape crimes?

467
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:35,140
Now, depending on how you record it in the crime statistics, that's a difference of 30 times.

468
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:40,980
And of course, the Swedish police record every individual instance of rape as a separate offence.

469
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,180
My point is that two countries using two different methods of collecting crime data

470
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,860
could have wildly different crime statistics, even if the actual number of crimes is identical.

471
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:58,660
And also, by the way, a country that actively encourages people to come forward and report rape to the police

472
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,780
will have a higher instance of reported rapes.

473
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,820
But that's good. That's what they want to happen.

474
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,620
I mean, consider the alternative.

475
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:15,300
In 2010, an Amnesty International report highlighted that sexual violence happens in every single country,

476
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:21,700
and yet the official figures show that some countries like Hong Kong and Mongolia have zero cases reported.

477
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,620
And that's from a BBC article about the rape statistics in Sweden.

478
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,220
Now, I would ask anyone blaming migrants for Sweden's relatively high number of reported rapes

479
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,780
if they think that nobody was ever raped in Hong Kong or Mongolia because,

480
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,860
and I'm guessing here, I imagine that is probably not the case.

481
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:46,500
Anyway, that BBC article I quoted just there actually offers a very good explanation

482
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,380
of the various ways in which crime statistics can vary from country to country.

483
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:58,340
As a comparison, they show that Australia and Canada have a vastly above average number of kidnappings,

484
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,900
more than Colombia and Mexico,

485
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,780
but this isn't because Australia, for example, actually has more kidnappings than Mexico.

486
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:12,100
The disparity is explained by the different ways each country classifies and records the crime.

487
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,700
And I quote,

488
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,740
So why haven't we heard any of these horror stories?

489
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,300
Are people being grabbed off the street in Sydney and Toronto while the world turns a blind eye?

490
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,420
No.

491
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,900
The high numbers of kidnapping cases in these two countries are explained by the fact that

492
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,140
parental disputes over child custody are included in the figures.

493
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,980
If one parent takes a child for the weekend and the other parent objects and calls the police,

494
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,860
the incident will be recorded as a kidnapping.

495
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,620
Comparing crime rates across countries is fraught with difficulties.

496
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,500
This is well known among criminologists and stati-

497
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,940
sta- sta-

498
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,540
statisticians, less so among journalists and commentators.

499
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:01,140
Now, this BBC article is included in a Sargon of Akkad video called Sweden's Rape Culture,

500
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,500
talking about the high rate of reported rapes in Sweden,

501
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,780
in which Sargon pretty much blames it all on the migrants.

502
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,580
So, we know Black Pigeon Speaks is, to put it frankly,

503
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,780
a dishonest liar.

504
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,140
He completely doesn't care whether what he's saying is true.

505
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,580
If it supports his world view, he'll fall for any old shit.

506
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,100
Sargon of Akkad, however, has a reputation for being a step above all that.

507
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:30,740
So I thought it'd be interesting to see how Sargon navigates his way through an article

508
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,780
that actually contains a lot of counter-arguments to his.

509
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,140
Let's take a look.

510
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,460
Take, for example, this 2012 BBC piece on the subject.

511
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,700
The article begins as follows.

512
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,980
The Julian Assange extradition case has put Sweden's relatively high

513
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,980
incidence of rape under the spotlight,

514
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,020
but can such statistics reliably be compared from one country to another?

515
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,540
Which two countries are the kidnapping capitals of the world?

516
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,940
Australia and Canada.

517
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,460
Official figures from the UN show that there were 17 kidnaps per 100,000 people in Australia in 2010

518
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,380
and 12.7 in Canada.

519
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,220
That compares with only 0.6 in Colombia and 1.1 in Mexico.

520
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,620
Which is without a doubt fascinating,

521
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,340
but what does this have to do with Sweden's skyrocketing rape statistics?

522
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,540
The answer is, of course, nothing.

523
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,060
Because the author of this BBC article is a rape apologist

524
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,980
who feels the need to attempt to play down exactly how bad

525
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,740
the gang rape situation in Sweden actually is

526
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,020
by comparing it to financially motivated kidnappings.

527
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,860
We do eventually reach the actual point of the article though.

528
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,700
Sweden has the highest rape rate in Europe,

529
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,780
author Naomi Wolf said on the BBC's Newsnight program recently.

530
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,300
Is it true? Yes.

531
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,860
Ah, now you see Sargon cut out a few paragraphs there.

532
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,420
Paragraphs that explain why the kidnapping example is relevant.

533
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,540
He cut from here in the article to here.

534
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,500
And that's a little sneaky to be honest.

535
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,380
He reads out the start of the kidnapping example,

536
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,420
but gets bored and declares it irrelevant before he gets to the conclusion.

537
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,420
And having zeroed in on the one or two sentences he actually agrees with,

538
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,140
Sargon leaves the article and all of its explanatory context right there

539
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,700
and never returns to it in the video.

540
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,980
That's the Sargon of Akkad method of argument, I guess.

541
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,700
If you just pretend to fall asleep halfway through hearing the opposing arguments,

542
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,740
you'll never be wrong.

543
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,300
Now to be fair to Sargon here,

544
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,940
someone in his comments called Eric the Dread did point out all the explanations that Sargon missed.

545
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,060
And so Sargon made a part two to this video where he apologizes for his mistake

546
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,060
and then tries to explain his omission.

547
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,740
Although, to again be fair to Sargon somewhat,

548
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,860
even though his response is fairly selective and dishonest,

549
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,900
he didn't have to respond to the criticism.

550
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,660
So he gets a big gold star from me for bothering to reply.

551
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,100
Well done, Sargon.

552
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,220
I've gone quite easy on Sargon today, haven't I?

553
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,500
I don't know why.

554
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,140
I've apparently got a bit of a soft spot for the guy.

555
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,260
Anyway, we're wandering a little bit here, so let's get back on track.

556
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,740
So I'd like to wrap up with one more little story.

557
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,780
Now, I just called Black Pigeon Speaks a dishonest liar who'll fall for any old shit

558
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,100
without even doing a cursory Google search,

559
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,820
so I'd just like to back that up a little with the following example

560
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,340
from his video entitled,

561
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,700
Break Europe, Merkel and Her Migrants, What Comes Next?

562
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,780
So, who is this refugee with a scar on his face?

563
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,340
On the right side of the picture, he appears to just be a regular refugee,

564
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,620
but on the left, he's pictured holding a rifle,

565
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,580
the implication being he's therefore a terrorist or ISIS supporter or something.

566
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,980
So this was a viral image from a while back.

567
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,940
Someone posted it to Facebook with the caption,

568
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,820
Remember this guy posing in ISIS photos last year?

569
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,820
Now he's a refugee.

570
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,420
Are we suckers or what?

571
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,300
Well, yes, although not in the way that you meant.

572
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,580
You see, the guy in the photographs is quite well known.

573
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,940
He's actually a former Syrian rebel commander.

574
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,220
He fought against ISIS, not for them,

575
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,540
and yet here he is being misidentified as an ISIS fighter.

576
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,460
For some reason, some inexplicable reason,

577
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,500
he said again, facetiously.

578
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,220
And this is really what sets Black Pigeon Speaks apart from the rest of the crowd.

579
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,140
Most of them at least care about trying to be factual,

580
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,900
but Black Pigeon will share any old chain email

581
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,860
sent by a racist uncle level nonsense he can get his grubby little talons on.

582
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,300
What this is, is it's intellectual dishonesty.

583
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,420
So we went through quite a few news stories there.

584
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,540
A lot of misinterpretation, exaggeration, and lying by omission.

585
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,660
So one might wonder, why does this happen?

586
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,700
Well, I know why it happens on the media end.

587
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,140
They want to sell papers and get clicks and racism sells.

588
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,580
But what's the explanation on the consumer end?

589
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:24,180
How can people who pride themselves on being rational and intelligent and impartial

590
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,060
so easily fall for all this half-baked nonsense?

591
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,980
I think the answer might lie in the reaction that some people give

592
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,860
when these sorts of news stories are debunked.

593
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,380
They get angry and upset and disappointed.

594
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,140
But why?

595
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,460
I mean, if I thought some terrible crime or miscarriage of justice had happened,

596
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,140
and then someone provided me with evidence that this proved what I believed,

597
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,340
I'd be happy.

598
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,100
Because it would have meant that a crime didn't take place.

599
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,980
Some people, though, seem to be suffering from what I'm gonna call outrage addiction.

600
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:02,660
They need to be outraged and they react negatively when someone takes it away from them.

601
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,820
It's anger as entertainment.

602
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,700
And as Tealdea so candidly admitted,

603
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,100
being factually accurate isn't really necessary.

604
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,580
And you see all flavors of this behavior, you know.

605
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,820
Black people in the States, immigrants and Muslims in Europe,

606
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,700
it can be the Jews, the feminists, etc.

607
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,100
Whoever you want to hate, it's not hard to find examples of individuals in that group

608
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,180
doing bad things or committing crimes.

609
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,820
But what if they don't do enough bad things or commit enough crimes

610
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,260
to justify how outraged you want to be about them?

611
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:43,060
What if there aren't enough actually real news stories to sustain your anger year round?

612
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,900
Well, that's where Breitbart comes in.

613
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,460
One thousand angry Muslims burned Germany's oldest church.

614
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,420
Did they actually do that?

615
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,220
Well, I don't know, but it seems like something I imagine they probably do,

616
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,380
so that's close enough for me.

617
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,180
So that's about it for me today, folks.

618
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,140
Should we close with a joke, though?

619
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,460
Who wants to know something really funny?

620
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:15,300
A couple of weeks before the large group of angry Muslims didn't attack the church in Dortmund,

621
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,540
the church was actually attacked by a group of German right-wing extremists.

622
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:30,260
On December 16th, a group of what the news website Dortmund24 calls neo-Nazis occupied the church,

623
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,380
barricaded themselves inside, hung a banner from the church that said

624
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:41,460
stop Islamization and no shit, set off fireworks on the roof.

625
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,020
When police arrived to arrest the group,

626
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,220
they had to chainsaw through one of the doors to get them out.

627
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:57,220
Now, I didn't see much reporting of this in the English-speaking press, oddly enough.

628
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,220
I guess neo-Nazis don't sell as well as Islamic extremists or something.

629
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,820
I mean, can you imagine if a bunch of Muslims had occupied the church?

630
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,580
We'd never hear the fucking end of it.

631
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,380
There's a double standard in the press.

632
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,900
That's a bold statement there aimed at the five of you who hadn't already noticed that.

633
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,220
So that's kind of funny, isn't it?

634
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,980
The same church, even, like, two weeks beforehand.

635
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,060
It's madness.

636
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,060
Anyway, thanks for watching, everyone.

637
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:34,260
I'd like to thank all of my supporters over on Patreon, who should be scrolling by right now,

638
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,580
for being very kind and generous and enabling me to keep making videos.

639
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,260
So a big heartfelt thank you to all of the names here.

640
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,380
I love each and every one of you.

641
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,540
And I'd like in particular to thank at RuneMian on Twitter again,

642
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,980
who helped me out not only with translation work this time,

643
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,380
but also stopped by the church in Dortmund to take a few photos for me,

644
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,540
and also tipped me off to the earlier occupation of the church.

645
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
So thank you at RuneMian.

646
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,540
You win the incredibly helpful Person of the Month award.

647
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,700
Anyway, bye for now.

648
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:24,100
So yeah, you know, if you run out of bullets, you put a knife through somebody's eye to it.
