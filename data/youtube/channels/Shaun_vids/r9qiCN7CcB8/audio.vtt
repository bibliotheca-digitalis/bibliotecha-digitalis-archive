00:00.000 --> 00:01.280
Hello, everyone.

00:01.280 --> 00:07.040
I'd like today to talk about a news story that happened only recently, but be warned.

00:07.040 --> 00:12.320
It's a news story so outrageous and infuriating that, just by hearing it,

00:12.320 --> 00:18.160
you're likely to enter into a fit of possibly fatal fury and anger.

00:18.160 --> 00:22.080
During New Year's Eve celebrations in Dortmund, Germany,

00:22.080 --> 00:27.840
a 1,000-strong mob of Muslim immigrant men attacked the police

00:27.920 --> 00:31.440
and set Germany's oldest church on fire.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.040
Can you believe that?

00:33.040 --> 00:38.000
The audacity of these foreign bastards, honestly.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.120
It's always the way with these immigrant types, isn't it?

00:41.120 --> 00:44.800
Germany's kind and gracious enough to offer them a home,

00:44.800 --> 00:48.080
and the first thing they do is go about attacking the police

00:48.080 --> 00:51.280
and burning the oldest church in the country.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.560
Typical.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.320
Now, the only thing that could make this story even more insulting and outrageous

00:56.320 --> 00:59.920
is if anything that I just said were actually true.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.840
You see, the events I just mentioned didn't really take place.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.880
It was all made up, almost out of thin air,

01:06.880 --> 01:12.320
but you wouldn't know that if you were reading brightbard.com on the 3rd of January

01:12.320 --> 01:16.880
because that website reported all of those events as true.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.600
So what's the actual truth here?

01:19.600 --> 01:22.560
Well, during New Year's Eve celebrations in Dortmund,

01:22.560 --> 01:27.840
a stray firework did light some scaffold netting on fire next to a church,

01:28.480 --> 01:32.160
which isn't actually even Germany's oldest church, by the way,

01:32.160 --> 01:36.320
but the netting was extinguished about ten minutes later

01:36.320 --> 01:38.560
with no actual damage to the church.

01:39.280 --> 01:43.600
And here's some current pictures of that church taken just the other day,

01:43.600 --> 01:46.720
kindly provided by one of my subscribers in Germany.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.160
And as you can see, it's very much still there.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.000
And here's the extent of the fire damage.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.360
Would you look at that?

01:55.360 --> 01:59.120
Now, in Germany's ongoing migrant arson epidemic,

01:59.120 --> 02:03.120
I'd say that this ranks right alongside the time that guy burned his toast.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.560
So anyway, the abject horror of some singed scaffold netting aside,

02:09.360 --> 02:11.520
why am I talking about this story?

02:12.160 --> 02:17.760
Well, this sort of overblown, hysterical reporting of a minor incident

02:17.760 --> 02:20.960
is something that I've been noticing more and more lately.

02:20.960 --> 02:25.040
Now, maybe I just haven't been paying enough attention up till now,

02:25.040 --> 02:29.920
or maybe folks are just being more blatant with their propaganda these days.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.920
I don't know, it's probably a bit of both, to be honest.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.560
Regardless, I'm noticing it now.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.280
And there's a pattern to this sort of thing.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.640
Firstly, some dreadful site like Breitbart or some tabloid newspaper

02:44.720 --> 02:48.480
will publish a completely morally outrageous story

02:48.480 --> 02:54.560
that is either entirely made up or exaggerated to the point of absurdity.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.080
Then the story will do the rounds on Twitter and Facebook and the likes.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.280
And of course, some of my YouTube pals will do their bit

03:01.280 --> 03:04.080
to make sure it reaches all of their subscribers.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.840
So what I want to do today is take a look at a few of these stories.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.640
We'll take a look at the initial reporting, the reactions to it on YouTube,

03:12.720 --> 03:15.760
and also, with the benefit of hindsight,

03:15.760 --> 03:19.120
we'll re-examine the stories and check for later developments

03:19.760 --> 03:22.800
and therefore see if all the fuss was justified.

03:22.800 --> 03:28.000
And the first case I want to look at concerns Thomas Salby, the balcony man.

03:28.640 --> 03:32.880
On the 22nd of July, 2016, as you might be aware,

03:32.880 --> 03:40.960
a teenager called Ali David Somboli shot nine people at a McDonald's in Munich, Germany.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.320
Shortly afterwards, a man called Thomas Salby

03:44.320 --> 03:48.480
shouted at and insulted Somboli from the balcony of his apartment

03:48.480 --> 03:50.880
and he also threw a beer bottle at him.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.600
The argument was captured on video by a neighbor

03:53.600 --> 03:57.280
and Salby was generally celebrated for standing up to the shooter.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.560
Shortly thereafter, however, someone reported Thomas Salby to the police

04:02.560 --> 04:06.000
for insulting the shooter, using the justification

04:06.000 --> 04:10.480
that provoking someone who has a gun is probably rather stupid.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.040
And so the police opened an investigation.

04:14.080 --> 04:17.280
A very short investigation, as it turns out.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.720
You see, the prosecutors very quickly came to the conclusion

04:20.720 --> 04:25.440
that the person reporting Salby to the police had the order of events wrong.

04:25.440 --> 04:30.400
In the opinion of public prosecutor Thomas Steinkraus Koch,

04:30.400 --> 04:34.880
whoever reported Salby must have thought that his insulting of Somboli

04:34.880 --> 04:39.840
happened before the shootings took place and was therefore a possible trigger for them.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.800
But actually, the exchange happened after the shootings

04:42.800 --> 04:46.560
and Somboli didn't kill anyone else afterwards except himself.

04:46.560 --> 04:51.600
And happily enough for Salby, in the opinion of the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office,

04:51.600 --> 04:56.480
the argument could have actually distracted the shooter from pursuing further targets.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.480
And as such, they announced that they were going to drop the investigation.

05:01.280 --> 05:08.960
They told this to the Munich-based newspaper TZ on the 4th of August, 2016.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.040
That's important, as it turns out.

05:11.040 --> 05:15.200
Now there's a few more dates to come, so I'm gonna mark this on a little calendar here

05:15.200 --> 05:18.000
so we can keep track of everything. So there we go.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.280
On the 4th of August, 2016, the prosecutors told a local newspaper

05:23.280 --> 05:28.160
that the investigation into Thomas Salby was going to be dropped.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.080
And so that's the end of that, right?

05:30.080 --> 05:33.840
Salby's case was investigated, he was found to have done nothing wrong,

05:33.840 --> 05:36.880
prosecutors announced the case is being dropped.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.380
The end.

05:38.180 --> 05:38.740
You'd think.

05:39.620 --> 05:45.940
You see, the very next day, on the 5th of August, the following story appeared on Breitbart.com.

05:46.500 --> 05:51.780
Balcony man who stood up to Munich shooter to face prosecution for insulting the dead.

05:52.740 --> 05:56.820
The Munich resident who hurled insults at shooter Ali David Somboli

05:56.820 --> 06:00.980
as he was carrying out an attack on a shopping mall has been accused of libel,

06:00.980 --> 06:02.820
the Munich prosecutor has announced.

06:03.380 --> 06:08.820
Now what Breitbart don't report in this story is that that same Munich Public Prosecutor's Office

06:08.820 --> 06:12.980
had already announced to the press that they would be dropping the investigation,

06:12.980 --> 06:18.740
because why let a little detail like that get in the way of such a great source of outraged clicks?

06:19.300 --> 06:22.900
And while you're here, remember to visit the official Breitbart store

06:22.900 --> 06:27.060
and buy a t-shirt and a really stupid belt buckle.

06:27.060 --> 06:29.220
Now on the same day as this Breitbart story,

06:29.220 --> 06:33.700
there was a very similar story on the website of the British newspaper, The Express.

06:34.820 --> 06:40.500
Brave man who stood up to Munich shooter now facing prosecution for insulting killer.

06:40.500 --> 06:46.180
And this story, like the Breitbart one, neglects to mention that the case was already being dropped.

06:47.060 --> 06:48.660
So what do we think here?

06:48.660 --> 06:54.100
Is it just a case of very lazy journalists not checking the facts on the stories they're writing,

06:54.100 --> 06:56.740
or is it a deliberate lie by omission?

06:57.460 --> 07:01.220
Only reporting the first half of the story on purpose,

07:01.220 --> 07:05.060
because it paints a picture of an ultra-PC German state

07:05.060 --> 07:08.820
that will punish a patriotic man just for insulting a murderer.

07:09.620 --> 07:10.740
Who knows?

07:10.740 --> 07:16.500
And I'd just like to briefly highlight a comment on the Breitbart article by user Snortripper.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.620
Okay, this is really poor reporting by Breitbart here.

07:19.620 --> 07:23.780
I've taken a run through the German press and what happened was someone reported Mr. Salby

07:23.780 --> 07:27.700
thinking his shouting insults at somebody had actually provoked the killings,

07:27.700 --> 07:29.940
not knowing they'd already taken place.

07:29.940 --> 07:32.580
The Munich state prosecutors dropped the case,

07:32.580 --> 07:35.620
so either a deliberate clickbait article by BBL,

07:35.620 --> 07:37.540
that's Breitbart London,

07:37.540 --> 07:39.300
to get everybody frothing or just,

07:40.180 --> 07:43.300
huh, another drop in quality control.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.020
Now this comment was posted on August 5th,

07:46.020 --> 07:51.620
the same date the story was published and is one of the highest rated comments on the article.

07:51.620 --> 07:56.900
So, for instance, if you were someone making a YouTube video featuring the story

07:56.900 --> 07:58.260
several weeks later,

07:58.900 --> 08:04.820
even a cursory glance at the comment section would reveal that the story is a load of rubbish.

08:04.820 --> 08:05.700
And speaking of...

08:06.340 --> 08:10.260
During the mass shooting in Munich on the 22nd of July 2016

08:10.260 --> 08:14.260
that took the lives of nine people and wounded 36 others,

08:14.260 --> 08:19.140
Thomas Salby, a 57-year-old German man, hurled abuse at the shooter,

08:19.140 --> 08:21.860
Ali Sonboli, from his balcony,

08:21.860 --> 08:27.940
while many praised Mr. Salby for standing up to the gunman who aimed shots in his direction.

08:27.940 --> 08:33.300
He was charged by the Munich prosecutor for liable for his comments.

08:33.300 --> 08:39.700
During the deadly attack, he repeatedly called the gunman a wanker and told him to fuck off.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.700
All I had was a beer bottle to throw at him,

08:41.700 --> 08:46.100
but if I had a gun I would have shot him in the head, the Munich residents said.

08:46.100 --> 08:52.660
German prosecutors are investigating Salby for potentially insulting the 18-year-old gunman

08:53.300 --> 08:57.780
who shot himself after the massacre, and he will most likely have to pay a fine.

08:58.740 --> 08:59.240
Uh...

09:00.180 --> 09:00.680
No.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.460
So that was Black Pigeon Speaks there,

09:03.460 --> 09:08.020
quoting both Breitbart and the Express on the 26th of August.

09:08.020 --> 09:11.940
So Black Pigeon had a few weeks to check out his sources there,

09:11.940 --> 09:15.140
but apparently neglected to.

09:15.220 --> 09:20.500
And Black Pigeon was by no means the only YouTuber tricked by these tabloid shenanigans.

09:20.500 --> 09:24.500
So we're gonna have a significant change of pace from annoying first world women

09:24.500 --> 09:26.660
to the Munich shooter.

09:26.660 --> 09:30.980
Specifically how a man who stood up and shouted at the guy from a balcony

09:30.980 --> 09:34.100
is now facing prosecution for insulting the killer.

09:34.660 --> 09:38.020
That's a chap called Sargon of Akkad there,

09:38.020 --> 09:42.500
sharing the Express story in his ongoing series with the self-fulfilling title,

09:43.140 --> 09:44.740
This Week in Stupid.

09:44.740 --> 09:48.420
Now, Sargon shared the story on only the 7th of August,

09:48.420 --> 09:52.420
so well done, Sargon, for being quick off the mark with that one.

09:52.420 --> 09:55.380
In fact, I'll somewhat let Sargon off the hook here.

09:55.380 --> 09:57.700
In his segment on the Express article,

09:57.700 --> 10:01.780
he is far more interested in laughing at how bad a newspaper the Express is

10:01.780 --> 10:05.140
than talking about the actual story itself.

10:05.140 --> 10:10.020
But he still shares the story, so Sargon gets an honorable mention here.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.300
And bringing up the rear, we've got an old friend of the show.

10:14.260 --> 10:16.900
A brave man who stood up to the Munich shooter

10:16.900 --> 10:21.460
now facing prosecution for insulting the killer.

10:22.660 --> 10:25.940
Because this is the world in which we live right now.

10:27.140 --> 10:30.740
Someone can be gunning people down in the street,

10:32.100 --> 10:36.740
and you're not allowed to basically look at them and say,

10:36.740 --> 10:38.260
you're being a bit of a wanker, mate.

10:39.060 --> 10:42.340
You can't do that, because then you're insulting someone

10:42.900 --> 10:46.260
who is higher than you on the progressive stack,

10:46.260 --> 10:50.420
and therefore you are the one who is doing it wrong.

10:51.140 --> 10:54.820
Because that makes perfect fucking sense, right?

10:55.860 --> 10:58.260
He said, all I had was a beer bottle to throw at him,

10:58.260 --> 11:02.020
but if I had a gun, I would have shot him in the head.

11:02.900 --> 11:06.580
And this is the appropriate reaction to have

11:06.580 --> 11:10.820
when someone is massacring innocent people in the middle of your city.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.420
Just doing, just getting them out of the way,

11:14.420 --> 11:17.540
bringing an end to everything, that's a wonderful thing.

11:17.540 --> 11:24.660
Except for if you're offending the religion of peace.

11:25.460 --> 11:30.500
You can't do that, because that's just not fucking allowed, right?

11:31.140 --> 11:34.900
So that's Tealdea there, talking about the express story

11:34.900 --> 11:39.540
on a live stream on his channel on the 2nd of September.

11:39.540 --> 11:42.100
So almost a month late to the party there.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.140
And I feel for Tealdea a little bit, to be honest.

11:45.140 --> 11:47.940
I mean, we can hardly expect him to keep pace

11:47.940 --> 11:50.980
with an intellectual powerhouse like Sargon of Akkad.

11:51.700 --> 11:55.780
Funnily enough, however, a little later in his live stream,

11:55.780 --> 11:58.020
someone in the chat points out to Tealdea

11:58.020 --> 12:00.260
that he doesn't have the full story.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.700
And Tealdea responds.

12:02.980 --> 12:04.580
A lot of people in the chat talking about feelings,

12:04.580 --> 12:06.260
someone's just saying, it's fucked up.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.780
Yeah, yeah, pretty much is.

12:08.340 --> 12:11.700
Someone pointing out, someone saying, seriously,

12:11.700 --> 12:14.020
you don't have the full story about it.

12:14.020 --> 12:15.860
I don't really very much care.

12:16.580 --> 12:19.780
And also, well, first of all, I don't really very much care.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.820
Streams are for entertainment, not for being entirely factual.

12:22.820 --> 12:24.580
And second of all, this is something

12:24.580 --> 12:27.220
from the very beginning of August, about a month ago.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.100
There is quite possibly information

12:30.100 --> 12:31.700
that's come out since then.

12:31.700 --> 12:35.300
Again, don't care, something called entertainment.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.140
Ta-da!

12:37.140 --> 12:39.380
Blew your fucking mind right there, didn't I?

12:40.180 --> 12:41.620
Uh, yes.

12:42.580 --> 12:43.380
Yes, you did.

12:43.940 --> 12:46.420
And as a little postscript to this segment,

12:46.420 --> 12:49.700
I'd like to have a bit of a think about Tealdea's comment

12:49.700 --> 12:51.460
about the religion of peace.

12:52.020 --> 12:54.980
Now that's a sarcastic jab at Islam there,

12:54.980 --> 12:56.340
and this reminded me of something

12:56.340 --> 12:58.420
in the Breitbart article near the bottom.

12:58.420 --> 13:00.980
They start talking about a Pegida march.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.540
That's the patriotic Europeans

13:03.540 --> 13:06.100
against the Islamization of the West group.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.980
Now why are Breitbart or Tealdea talking about Islam?

13:11.620 --> 13:15.300
Ali David Somboli, the Munich shooter, was not a Muslim.

13:16.020 --> 13:17.860
He was also not an immigrant.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.620
He was born in Germany.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.260
He idolized Anders Breivik.

13:22.260 --> 13:26.500
He staged his shooting on the anniversary of Breivik's shooting.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.380
He was, like, super not a Muslim.

13:29.380 --> 13:34.740
And yet he automatically gets lumped in with actual Islamic terrorists.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.420
For some reason.

13:37.140 --> 13:43.780
And I wonder why that is, he said, facetiously knowing the answer.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.300
So anyway, let's move on to our next story.

13:47.300 --> 13:51.140
And this one concerns the Isle of Bute in Scotland.

13:51.140 --> 13:55.620
So in December of 2015, 15 Syrian refugee families

13:55.620 --> 13:58.740
were relocated to the Scottish island of Bute.

13:59.620 --> 14:00.120
Bute?

14:00.740 --> 14:02.180
I think that's how you say it.

14:02.900 --> 14:07.860
And in February of 2016, something terrible happened.

14:08.580 --> 14:13.700
UK police arrest man for offensive Facebook post about migrants.

14:14.260 --> 14:17.220
British police have promised not to tolerate any speech

14:17.220 --> 14:21.220
that could cause offence on social media regarding Syrian migrants

14:21.220 --> 14:25.940
after arresting a man for Facebook comments made about recent arrivals

14:25.940 --> 14:28.180
on his small Scottish island.

14:28.180 --> 14:31.220
The tiny Isle of Bute in the Firth of Clyde,

14:31.220 --> 14:36.260
which has a total population of just 6,498 in 2011,

14:36.260 --> 14:40.100
is expected to take in around 1,000 Syrian migrants,

14:40.660 --> 14:44.100
with 12 families already arriving since December last year.

14:44.740 --> 14:45.540
Picture above.

14:46.100 --> 14:51.220
Now, I'm as excited as the next guy to be outraged about this offence to free speech,

14:51.220 --> 14:53.700
but I have to pause a moment here.

14:53.700 --> 14:57.140
Bute is going to take in 1,000 Syrian migrants?

14:57.940 --> 15:01.460
I'm very sorry to Breitbart there, but that's not true.

15:01.460 --> 15:05.860
You see, if we click their link for the source about the 1,000 Syrian migrants,

15:05.860 --> 15:09.780
we're taken to an express story from the 6th of December,

15:09.780 --> 15:14.420
which says they are among the first of about 1,000 refugees

15:14.420 --> 15:20.180
who are to be relocated around the west central area of Scotland.

15:20.180 --> 15:24.820
So 1,000 refugees are being relocated to central Scotland in general.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.020
Not this one island specifically.

15:28.020 --> 15:30.980
Only 15 families were relocated to Bute,

15:30.980 --> 15:35.220
so unless all of those families have an average of 60-plus members each,

15:35.220 --> 15:39.860
I doubt Breitbart's 1,000 figure is entirely accurate.

15:39.860 --> 15:44.100
So how many refugees in total were actually sent to Bute?

15:44.100 --> 15:47.380
More families are set to arrive on Bute over the next few weeks,

15:47.380 --> 15:52.980
which will bring the total to 28 adults and 31 children.

15:52.980 --> 15:59.620
So 59. I mean, that's okay Breitbart, you were only 941 off.

16:00.260 --> 16:04.260
Anyway, uh, sorry about that, let's get back to the outrage, shall we?

16:05.380 --> 16:12.100
However, commenting on the comparatively huge and sudden influx of Muslim immigrants online

16:12.100 --> 16:15.380
just became a very risky business for local residents.

16:16.260 --> 16:20.020
Police have confirmed they've arrested a 41-year-old local man

16:20.020 --> 16:25.540
under the Communications Act after receiving a report of a supposedly

16:26.500 --> 16:32.180
offensive comment made on Facebook regarding the migrants.

16:32.180 --> 16:33.620
So isn't that awful?

16:33.620 --> 16:39.060
You simply comment on the migrants' arrivals, completely neutrally and non-offensively of course,

16:39.060 --> 16:42.260
and you end up arrested and thrown in jail.

16:42.900 --> 16:47.060
George Orwell's 1984 has finally come true.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.860
Rally, my YouTube brothers.

16:50.420 --> 16:52.740
Don't let this injustice stand.

16:52.740 --> 17:00.420
A man was arrested in Scotland over offensive social media posts directed at Syrian refugees.

17:01.300 --> 17:05.540
And now there's a guy got arrested for Facebook posts about Syrian refugees in Scotland,

17:05.540 --> 17:10.340
which is, you know, at first I kind of panicked about this because we had millennial woes on,

17:10.340 --> 17:12.420
and, you know, he describes himself as a Scottish guy.

17:12.420 --> 17:16.420
I'm like, Jesus Christ, let me find out that, let me find out it was him.

17:16.420 --> 17:23.220
A man has got arrested for Facebook posts about the Syrian refugees in Scotland,

17:23.220 --> 17:27.380
and this is something that would normally shock me.

17:27.380 --> 17:32.500
However, due to the fact that I operate this channel and every day I talk about similar news,

17:32.500 --> 17:36.420
it's now like, eh, it was bound to happen sooner or later.

17:36.420 --> 17:40.900
Police in Scotland have said the arrest of a man responsible for a series of offensive Facebook

17:40.900 --> 17:45.780
posts about Syrian refugees should send a clear message that such social media abuse

17:45.780 --> 17:47.540
will not be tolerated.

17:47.540 --> 17:54.100
Should send a clear message that such social media abuse will not be tolerated.

17:54.100 --> 18:00.020
Should send a clear message that such a social media abuse will not be tolerated.

18:00.020 --> 18:02.900
We will not tolerate your criticism of this group.

18:03.620 --> 18:06.180
These people are beyond reproach.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.740
I consider myself kind of a free speech absolutist.

18:09.300 --> 18:13.940
I really agree with case law in the US on freedom of speech.

18:13.940 --> 18:21.460
The very, very rare exceptions to freedom of speech are basically direct threats of violence.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.300
Freedom of expression and opinion.

18:23.300 --> 18:27.140
Well, outside of the US, that's also a thing of the past.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.180
Post your disgruntlement of the government's policies

18:30.180 --> 18:33.620
and you will be arrested in many countries in the West.

18:33.620 --> 18:42.180
So let's see what exactly did the person say, which I guess required the police to burst in,

18:42.180 --> 18:45.220
because it was probably a crime being committed there, right?

18:45.220 --> 18:49.380
Now, we don't have any specific information on what was said in the post.

18:50.820 --> 18:52.180
Wait, what?

18:52.900 --> 18:54.180
We don't know what he said.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.620
Well, okay, I mean, from how everyone is acting,

18:57.620 --> 19:02.580
I'd assume that the man had just politely disagreed with the government's immigration policies.

19:02.580 --> 19:08.020
I mean, everyone has a right to free speech, but as YouTube channel Secular Talk points out,

19:08.020 --> 19:11.620
that doesn't cover threatening people or inciting violence.

19:11.620 --> 19:16.260
I mean, this guy could have been threatening to cut the refugees' heads off for all we know.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.260
So why don't we know what he said?

19:18.260 --> 19:20.180
Well, when these YouTube videos were made,

19:20.180 --> 19:23.460
what the man said on Facebook wasn't actually publicly known,

19:23.460 --> 19:26.180
which might lead a more critical person than me to comment

19:26.180 --> 19:29.700
that they'd all unnecessarily jumped the gun a little bit.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.420
So with the benefit of living in the future,

19:32.420 --> 19:37.780
let's cheat a bit and go back in time and see what the guy actually said.

19:37.780 --> 19:42.980
And this is the Scottish Daily Mail from the 26th of May, 2016,

19:42.980 --> 19:47.380
commenting on the man's, that is, Scott Clark's, appearance in court.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.380
And would you believe it?

19:49.380 --> 19:53.860
A journalist actually did some journalism and went and dug up his comments,

19:53.860 --> 19:57.940
which were posted to the Facebook page of the Scottish Defence League.

19:57.940 --> 19:59.140
And let's see what he said.

20:00.660 --> 20:05.140
Islamic invasion on Bute, refugees were in a local boozer,

20:05.140 --> 20:07.380
all pissed, I assume.

20:08.420 --> 20:10.900
They're dirty, they're savages.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.660
He said he'd cut their heads off.

20:13.460 --> 20:14.500
Oh, would you look at that?

20:14.500 --> 20:17.540
He did say that he'd cut the refugees' heads off.

20:17.540 --> 20:18.420
What a surprise.

20:20.180 --> 20:21.700
But I should come clean a bit here.

20:21.700 --> 20:26.260
When I earlier postulated cutting the refugees' heads off

20:26.260 --> 20:28.580
as something that Scott Clark may have said,

20:29.780 --> 20:32.020
I was cheating a bit there, but I knew.

20:32.020 --> 20:32.900
I knew what he'd said.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.820
I'd already read this news story.

20:35.220 --> 20:37.300
I script out the whole video in advance.

20:38.580 --> 20:42.260
It's a little technique I learned from Behring,

20:42.260 --> 20:47.860
where what you do is you pretend to anticipate what's coming up in your own video,

20:47.860 --> 20:50.740
and it makes you seem clever, apparently.

20:52.420 --> 20:53.140
Oh, well.

20:53.140 --> 20:54.100
What else did he say?

20:54.900 --> 20:57.700
There's definitely something going down on this island,

20:57.700 --> 21:00.100
and when it does these Fs,

21:00.180 --> 21:05.140
we'll see the nasty side to us who have opposed their arrival from the start.

21:06.180 --> 21:10.740
Other comments were too explicit to be printed in a family newspaper,

21:10.740 --> 21:14.500
so apparently the decapitations were just a start.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.900
So what's the lesson from this story?

21:16.900 --> 21:22.900
Well, I'd say maybe wait until all the facts are in about an ongoing police investigation

21:22.900 --> 21:26.740
before you prematurely declare the death of free speech.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.780
It's not the catchiest lesson, I agree,

21:29.780 --> 21:33.460
but, you know, let's move on.

21:33.460 --> 21:39.860
So next up, we've got two very similar stories about German tattoos and Swedish wristbands,

21:39.860 --> 21:42.580
and we'll do the Germans first, because why not?

21:43.220 --> 21:44.180
I'm not making this up.

21:44.180 --> 21:45.700
This is not satire.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.220
Here's the story in Die Welt.

21:48.260 --> 21:51.220
Do you see that young girl, probably around 12 years old,

21:51.220 --> 21:57.060
she is wearing a temporary tattoo on her shoulder that says no,

21:57.700 --> 22:00.580
and it has angel wings on it or something.

22:00.580 --> 22:08.420
And as the story explains, it's a signal to Muslim men that means no, don't rape me.

22:08.420 --> 22:12.340
And here's a local politician who is so proud of this solution.

22:12.340 --> 22:19.060
She's got a poster of a baby girl, a baby, for crying out loud, that says no, not with me.

22:20.580 --> 22:23.940
This is the solution to Muslim migrants sexually assaulting German girls?

22:24.660 --> 22:26.660
Have a temporary tattoo that says no?

22:27.540 --> 22:32.500
Just in case the screaming girl shouting no when she's being raped isn't enough,

22:32.500 --> 22:36.660
maybe the tattoo will be the thing that stops a rapist from raping.

22:37.460 --> 22:40.100
Look at how proud that politician was, eh?

22:40.100 --> 22:44.500
Young girls at German swimming pools are now being given temporary tattoos with the word no

22:45.140 --> 22:48.260
on them in the attempt to put off rapists.

22:48.260 --> 22:53.380
The stick-on messages say no in German and English, but strangely not in Arabic.

22:53.460 --> 22:57.940
And officials hope they will lead to a fall in sexual assaults at public baths.

22:57.940 --> 23:02.740
That was YouTube channels, Black Pigeon Speaks, and Rebel Media.

23:02.740 --> 23:06.340
They're talking about a hilariously ineffectual campaign

23:06.340 --> 23:10.900
to apparently stop Muslim migrants sexually harassing people in pools.

23:11.540 --> 23:14.420
And they're quoting a Mail Online article which says,

23:15.060 --> 23:20.740
Young girls at German swimming pools are being given temporary tattoos with the word no on them

23:20.740 --> 23:22.740
in an attempt to put off rapists.

23:23.380 --> 23:26.100
The stick-on messages say no in German and English,

23:26.100 --> 23:30.340
and officials hope they will lead to a fall in sexual assaults at public baths.

23:30.340 --> 23:36.180
The new move comes after increased fears of sex attacks by migrants in the country.

23:36.180 --> 23:40.980
However, authorities say the problem has long existed in Germany's pools.

23:40.980 --> 23:46.820
Now the phrase, the new move comes after increased fears of sex attacks by migrants,

23:46.820 --> 23:50.020
is an absolutely wonderful little bit of deception there,

23:50.020 --> 23:54.900
because it leads readers to assume that the temporary tattoo initiative was a response

23:55.540 --> 24:00.020
to migrant sexual abuse in pools, when in fact, it was not.

24:00.020 --> 24:05.140
Now the Mail Online article was published on the 23rd of August, 2016,

24:05.140 --> 24:11.220
and is quoting a news story from German news website Welt.de.

24:11.220 --> 24:12.260
Welt? Welt?

24:13.620 --> 24:14.580
German.

24:14.580 --> 24:17.940
YouTube channel Rebel Media showed this article

24:17.940 --> 24:22.740
and completely lied about it, as it turns out in their video.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.300
You see, if we look at this article,

24:25.300 --> 24:29.940
we see the women's and family representative of the district in which the tattoos were launched,

24:29.940 --> 24:32.260
Veronika Vasha Gogirla,

24:33.060 --> 24:37.780
saying that the tattoo initiative has nothing at all to do with migrants or Muslims.

24:38.340 --> 24:40.980
It's completely independent, she says.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.500
Sexual harassment in swimming pools has always been the case.

24:44.660 --> 24:49.780
Rebel Media did not choose to translate this quote, strangely enough.

24:49.780 --> 24:53.540
You see, the temporary tattoos are just an awareness-raising campaign

24:53.540 --> 24:56.980
to get people talking about the issue of sexual harassment,

24:56.980 --> 25:00.660
and like, a way to introduce the concept to children, I guess.

25:00.660 --> 25:03.220
It's got shit all to do with migrants.

25:03.220 --> 25:07.780
In fact, that Welt.de story quotes the German Interior Ministry,

25:07.780 --> 25:09.380
saying that over the last five years,

25:09.380 --> 25:14.020
the number of sexual assaults in swimming pools has not significantly changed.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.780
What actually happened here is,

25:15.780 --> 25:21.060
one German district started an awareness-raising campaign about sexual harassment,

25:21.060 --> 25:25.060
and some news organizations knew they could get outraged clicks

25:25.060 --> 25:29.140
if they awkwardly forced the migrant issue into the story.

25:29.140 --> 25:34.260
Migrants plus sexual abuse sells papers and gets clicks.

25:34.260 --> 25:37.380
So if all you've got is a story about sexual abuse,

25:37.380 --> 25:40.900
you just jam the migrant angle in any way you can.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.660
Speaking of, let's do the Swedish wristbands.

25:44.660 --> 25:48.980
And this one is just a straight retelling of the tattoo story, truth be told.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.780
This one even has a Snopes page, handily enough.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.540
What's true?

25:53.540 --> 25:56.660
Police in Sweden are distributing colored bracelets

25:56.660 --> 25:59.060
as a means of engaging young people

25:59.060 --> 26:02.100
and raising awareness about unwanted sexual offenses.

26:02.820 --> 26:04.660
However, what's false,

26:04.660 --> 26:08.020
Swedish police did not create or distribute the bracelets

26:08.020 --> 26:11.460
in an attempt to dissuade refugees from raping Swedish women.

26:12.020 --> 26:15.940
It's just another awareness-raising campaign that's been co-opted

26:15.940 --> 26:20.500
and had an anti-immigrant message completely baselessly tied to it.

26:20.500 --> 26:24.420
However, BlackPigeonSpeaks would have been unlikely to notice this

26:24.420 --> 26:28.900
because he already has some rather particular notions about Sweden.

26:29.460 --> 26:32.180
The signs of decline are already observable.

26:32.180 --> 26:34.900
While many countries are sliding into social decline,

26:34.900 --> 26:39.620
the canary in the coal mine is the self-described humanitarian superpower

26:39.620 --> 26:42.500
that pursues a feminist foreign policy.

26:42.500 --> 26:46.900
When looking at Sweden, it's one of the most gender-equal countries on Earth.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.700
And while they've become the rape capital of Europe,

26:49.700 --> 26:52.980
they're flushing their culture and country down the toilet

26:52.980 --> 26:55.940
and pressing forward in their civilizational suicide

26:55.940 --> 26:57.940
at an ever-accelerating pace.

26:58.500 --> 27:02.420
So, Sweden has the rape capital of Europe,

27:02.420 --> 27:04.340
they've let all the immigrants in,

27:04.340 --> 27:07.460
and now they're going around raping everyone.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.060
Is any of this true?

27:09.620 --> 27:14.260
Well, Sweden does have the highest amount of reported rapes in Europe.

27:14.260 --> 27:17.140
However, this is not necessarily a bad thing.

27:18.100 --> 27:18.980
Stay with me now.

27:20.340 --> 27:25.140
In fact, Sweden's high amount of reported rapes relative to the rest of Europe

27:25.140 --> 27:28.100
is, in some respects, a good thing.

27:28.100 --> 27:32.660
And if you're wondering how this could be, the key is in the word reported.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.900
So let's think about this a bit more.

27:35.460 --> 27:39.860
For starters, the idea that Sweden's relatively high number of reported rapes

27:39.860 --> 27:42.980
is linked to some recent migrant influx

27:42.980 --> 27:48.500
is countered by the fact that Sweden has, for a very long time, not just recently,

27:48.500 --> 27:52.580
had a relatively high number of reported rapes relative to Europe.

27:53.140 --> 27:56.580
The Wikipedia article on rape in Sweden says,

27:56.580 --> 28:02.020
In 1996, Sweden registered almost three times the average number of rape offences

28:02.580 --> 28:05.780
registered in 35 European countries.

28:05.780 --> 28:08.580
So unless these recent migrants have time machines,

28:08.580 --> 28:13.460
I don't think we can say they're solely to blame for Sweden's high number of reported rapes.

28:13.460 --> 28:19.140
So if it's not down to recent migration, why is Sweden at the number one spot?

28:19.140 --> 28:22.340
Well, for starters, Sweden has sex crime legislation

28:22.340 --> 28:26.020
that has one of the most expansive definitions of rape in the world.

28:26.020 --> 28:30.740
More things are classed as rape in Sweden, on average, than in the rest of Europe.

28:30.740 --> 28:33.060
And this brings up an interesting point.

28:33.060 --> 28:36.500
It's very difficult to compare crime rates across countries

28:36.500 --> 28:39.540
that use different definitions of the crime.

28:39.540 --> 28:42.980
For example, I'm quoting Wikipedia again here,

28:42.980 --> 28:45.300
Unlike the majority of countries in Europe,

28:45.300 --> 28:50.580
crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported,

28:50.580 --> 28:53.300
at which point the classification may be unclear.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.980
In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape,

28:56.980 --> 29:00.580
it retains this classification in the published crime statistics,

29:00.580 --> 29:04.900
even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven,

29:04.900 --> 29:10.340
or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification.

29:10.340 --> 29:12.500
And I'd like to ask a question here.

29:12.500 --> 29:19.060
Let's say a woman goes to the police and says her husband has raped her every night for the last month.

29:19.780 --> 29:22.340
Now, how would you record that crime?

29:22.340 --> 29:26.660
Do you record that as one instance of rape but happening repeatedly,

29:26.660 --> 29:29.460
or 30 separate rape crimes?

29:29.460 --> 29:35.140
Now, depending on how you record it in the crime statistics, that's a difference of 30 times.

29:35.140 --> 29:40.980
And of course, the Swedish police record every individual instance of rape as a separate offence.

29:40.980 --> 29:46.180
My point is that two countries using two different methods of collecting crime data

29:46.180 --> 29:51.860
could have wildly different crime statistics, even if the actual number of crimes is identical.

29:51.940 --> 29:58.660
And also, by the way, a country that actively encourages people to come forward and report rape to the police

29:58.660 --> 30:01.780
will have a higher instance of reported rapes.

30:01.780 --> 30:04.820
But that's good. That's what they want to happen.

30:04.820 --> 30:07.620
I mean, consider the alternative.

30:07.620 --> 30:15.300
In 2010, an Amnesty International report highlighted that sexual violence happens in every single country,

30:15.300 --> 30:21.700
and yet the official figures show that some countries like Hong Kong and Mongolia have zero cases reported.

30:21.700 --> 30:25.620
And that's from a BBC article about the rape statistics in Sweden.

30:26.340 --> 30:31.220
Now, I would ask anyone blaming migrants for Sweden's relatively high number of reported rapes

30:31.220 --> 30:35.780
if they think that nobody was ever raped in Hong Kong or Mongolia because,

30:35.780 --> 30:39.860
and I'm guessing here, I imagine that is probably not the case.

30:40.580 --> 30:46.500
Anyway, that BBC article I quoted just there actually offers a very good explanation

30:46.500 --> 30:51.380
of the various ways in which crime statistics can vary from country to country.

30:51.380 --> 30:58.340
As a comparison, they show that Australia and Canada have a vastly above average number of kidnappings,

30:58.340 --> 31:00.900
more than Colombia and Mexico,

31:00.900 --> 31:05.780
but this isn't because Australia, for example, actually has more kidnappings than Mexico.

31:06.420 --> 31:12.100
The disparity is explained by the different ways each country classifies and records the crime.

31:12.660 --> 31:13.700
And I quote,

31:13.700 --> 31:16.740
So why haven't we heard any of these horror stories?

31:16.740 --> 31:21.300
Are people being grabbed off the street in Sydney and Toronto while the world turns a blind eye?

31:21.860 --> 31:22.420
No.

31:22.420 --> 31:26.900
The high numbers of kidnapping cases in these two countries are explained by the fact that

31:26.900 --> 31:31.140
parental disputes over child custody are included in the figures.

31:31.940 --> 31:36.980
If one parent takes a child for the weekend and the other parent objects and calls the police,

31:36.980 --> 31:39.860
the incident will be recorded as a kidnapping.

31:39.860 --> 31:43.620
Comparing crime rates across countries is fraught with difficulties.

31:43.620 --> 31:46.500
This is well known among criminologists and stati-

31:46.500 --> 31:47.940
sta- sta-

31:47.940 --> 31:53.540
statisticians, less so among journalists and commentators.

31:54.100 --> 32:01.140
Now, this BBC article is included in a Sargon of Akkad video called Sweden's Rape Culture,

32:01.140 --> 32:04.500
talking about the high rate of reported rapes in Sweden,

32:04.500 --> 32:07.780
in which Sargon pretty much blames it all on the migrants.

32:08.420 --> 32:12.580
So, we know Black Pigeon Speaks is, to put it frankly,

32:12.580 --> 32:13.780
a dishonest liar.

32:13.780 --> 32:17.140
He completely doesn't care whether what he's saying is true.

32:17.140 --> 32:20.580
If it supports his world view, he'll fall for any old shit.

32:21.460 --> 32:26.100
Sargon of Akkad, however, has a reputation for being a step above all that.

32:26.100 --> 32:30.740
So I thought it'd be interesting to see how Sargon navigates his way through an article

32:30.740 --> 32:33.780
that actually contains a lot of counter-arguments to his.

32:34.340 --> 32:35.140
Let's take a look.

32:35.780 --> 32:39.460
Take, for example, this 2012 BBC piece on the subject.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.700
The article begins as follows.

32:42.420 --> 32:46.980
The Julian Assange extradition case has put Sweden's relatively high

32:46.980 --> 32:48.980
incidence of rape under the spotlight,

32:49.540 --> 32:54.020
but can such statistics reliably be compared from one country to another?

32:54.740 --> 32:57.540
Which two countries are the kidnapping capitals of the world?

32:58.260 --> 32:59.940
Australia and Canada.

32:59.940 --> 33:05.460
Official figures from the UN show that there were 17 kidnaps per 100,000 people in Australia in 2010

33:05.460 --> 33:07.380
and 12.7 in Canada.

33:07.380 --> 33:11.220
That compares with only 0.6 in Colombia and 1.1 in Mexico.

33:11.780 --> 33:13.620
Which is without a doubt fascinating,

33:13.620 --> 33:18.340
but what does this have to do with Sweden's skyrocketing rape statistics?

33:18.900 --> 33:21.540
The answer is, of course, nothing.

33:21.540 --> 33:25.060
Because the author of this BBC article is a rape apologist

33:25.060 --> 33:28.980
who feels the need to attempt to play down exactly how bad

33:28.980 --> 33:32.740
the gang rape situation in Sweden actually is

33:32.740 --> 33:36.020
by comparing it to financially motivated kidnappings.

33:36.660 --> 33:39.860
We do eventually reach the actual point of the article though.

33:40.740 --> 33:43.700
Sweden has the highest rape rate in Europe,

33:43.700 --> 33:47.780
author Naomi Wolf said on the BBC's Newsnight program recently.

33:47.780 --> 33:49.300
Is it true? Yes.

33:49.860 --> 33:53.860
Ah, now you see Sargon cut out a few paragraphs there.

33:53.860 --> 33:58.420
Paragraphs that explain why the kidnapping example is relevant.

33:58.420 --> 34:01.540
He cut from here in the article to here.

34:02.180 --> 34:04.500
And that's a little sneaky to be honest.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.380
He reads out the start of the kidnapping example,

34:07.460 --> 34:12.420
but gets bored and declares it irrelevant before he gets to the conclusion.

34:12.420 --> 34:16.420
And having zeroed in on the one or two sentences he actually agrees with,

34:16.420 --> 34:21.140
Sargon leaves the article and all of its explanatory context right there

34:21.140 --> 34:23.700
and never returns to it in the video.

34:23.700 --> 34:26.980
That's the Sargon of Akkad method of argument, I guess.

34:26.980 --> 34:31.700
If you just pretend to fall asleep halfway through hearing the opposing arguments,

34:31.700 --> 34:32.740
you'll never be wrong.

34:33.380 --> 34:35.300
Now to be fair to Sargon here,

34:35.860 --> 34:41.940
someone in his comments called Eric the Dread did point out all the explanations that Sargon missed.

34:41.940 --> 34:47.060
And so Sargon made a part two to this video where he apologizes for his mistake

34:47.060 --> 34:49.060
and then tries to explain his omission.

34:49.620 --> 34:52.740
Although, to again be fair to Sargon somewhat,

34:52.740 --> 34:55.860
even though his response is fairly selective and dishonest,

34:56.580 --> 34:58.900
he didn't have to respond to the criticism.

35:00.100 --> 35:04.660
So he gets a big gold star from me for bothering to reply.

35:04.660 --> 35:06.100
Well done, Sargon.

35:06.100 --> 35:09.220
I've gone quite easy on Sargon today, haven't I?

35:09.220 --> 35:10.500
I don't know why.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.140
I've apparently got a bit of a soft spot for the guy.

35:13.700 --> 35:18.260
Anyway, we're wandering a little bit here, so let's get back on track.

35:18.260 --> 35:20.740
So I'd like to wrap up with one more little story.

35:20.740 --> 35:25.780
Now, I just called Black Pigeon Speaks a dishonest liar who'll fall for any old shit

35:25.780 --> 35:28.100
without even doing a cursory Google search,

35:28.100 --> 35:32.820
so I'd just like to back that up a little with the following example

35:32.820 --> 35:34.340
from his video entitled,

35:35.060 --> 35:39.700
Break Europe, Merkel and Her Migrants, What Comes Next?

35:39.700 --> 35:43.780
So, who is this refugee with a scar on his face?

35:44.340 --> 35:48.340
On the right side of the picture, he appears to just be a regular refugee,

35:48.900 --> 35:51.620
but on the left, he's pictured holding a rifle,

35:51.620 --> 35:56.580
the implication being he's therefore a terrorist or ISIS supporter or something.

35:56.580 --> 35:58.980
So this was a viral image from a while back.

35:59.620 --> 36:01.940
Someone posted it to Facebook with the caption,

36:02.740 --> 36:06.820
Remember this guy posing in ISIS photos last year?

36:06.820 --> 36:08.820
Now he's a refugee.

36:08.820 --> 36:10.420
Are we suckers or what?

36:11.860 --> 36:15.300
Well, yes, although not in the way that you meant.

36:15.860 --> 36:18.580
You see, the guy in the photographs is quite well known.

36:18.580 --> 36:21.940
He's actually a former Syrian rebel commander.

36:21.940 --> 36:25.220
He fought against ISIS, not for them,

36:25.220 --> 36:29.540
and yet here he is being misidentified as an ISIS fighter.

36:30.100 --> 36:33.460
For some reason, some inexplicable reason,

36:34.340 --> 36:36.500
he said again, facetiously.

36:37.540 --> 36:41.220
And this is really what sets Black Pigeon Speaks apart from the rest of the crowd.

36:41.860 --> 36:45.140
Most of them at least care about trying to be factual,

36:45.140 --> 36:48.900
but Black Pigeon will share any old chain email

36:48.900 --> 36:53.860
sent by a racist uncle level nonsense he can get his grubby little talons on.

36:53.860 --> 36:57.300
What this is, is it's intellectual dishonesty.

36:57.940 --> 37:00.420
So we went through quite a few news stories there.

37:00.980 --> 37:05.540
A lot of misinterpretation, exaggeration, and lying by omission.

37:05.540 --> 37:08.660
So one might wonder, why does this happen?

37:09.220 --> 37:11.700
Well, I know why it happens on the media end.

37:11.700 --> 37:15.140
They want to sell papers and get clicks and racism sells.

37:15.860 --> 37:18.580
But what's the explanation on the consumer end?

37:19.220 --> 37:24.180
How can people who pride themselves on being rational and intelligent and impartial

37:24.180 --> 37:27.060
so easily fall for all this half-baked nonsense?

37:27.620 --> 37:30.980
I think the answer might lie in the reaction that some people give

37:30.980 --> 37:33.860
when these sorts of news stories are debunked.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.380
They get angry and upset and disappointed.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.140
But why?

37:39.140 --> 37:43.460
I mean, if I thought some terrible crime or miscarriage of justice had happened,

37:43.460 --> 37:47.140
and then someone provided me with evidence that this proved what I believed,

37:47.140 --> 37:48.340
I'd be happy.

37:48.340 --> 37:52.100
Because it would have meant that a crime didn't take place.

37:52.100 --> 37:56.980
Some people, though, seem to be suffering from what I'm gonna call outrage addiction.

37:57.380 --> 38:02.660
They need to be outraged and they react negatively when someone takes it away from them.

38:02.660 --> 38:04.820
It's anger as entertainment.

38:05.460 --> 38:07.700
And as Tealdea so candidly admitted,

38:08.260 --> 38:12.100
being factually accurate isn't really necessary.

38:12.100 --> 38:14.580
And you see all flavors of this behavior, you know.

38:15.300 --> 38:18.820
Black people in the States, immigrants and Muslims in Europe,

38:18.820 --> 38:21.700
it can be the Jews, the feminists, etc.

38:21.700 --> 38:26.100
Whoever you want to hate, it's not hard to find examples of individuals in that group

38:26.100 --> 38:28.180
doing bad things or committing crimes.

38:28.740 --> 38:32.820
But what if they don't do enough bad things or commit enough crimes

38:32.820 --> 38:36.260
to justify how outraged you want to be about them?

38:36.980 --> 38:43.060
What if there aren't enough actually real news stories to sustain your anger year round?

38:43.060 --> 38:44.900
Well, that's where Breitbart comes in.

38:45.780 --> 38:49.460
One thousand angry Muslims burned Germany's oldest church.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.420
Did they actually do that?

38:53.060 --> 38:57.220
Well, I don't know, but it seems like something I imagine they probably do,

38:57.220 --> 38:59.380
so that's close enough for me.

39:00.020 --> 39:02.180
So that's about it for me today, folks.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.140
Should we close with a joke, though?

39:05.140 --> 39:07.460
Who wants to know something really funny?

39:08.740 --> 39:15.300
A couple of weeks before the large group of angry Muslims didn't attack the church in Dortmund,

39:15.300 --> 39:21.540
the church was actually attacked by a group of German right-wing extremists.

39:22.260 --> 39:30.260
On December 16th, a group of what the news website Dortmund24 calls neo-Nazis occupied the church,

39:30.900 --> 39:35.380
barricaded themselves inside, hung a banner from the church that said

39:35.380 --> 39:41.460
stop Islamization and no shit, set off fireworks on the roof.

39:45.700 --> 39:48.020
When police arrived to arrest the group,

39:48.020 --> 39:51.220
they had to chainsaw through one of the doors to get them out.

39:51.620 --> 39:57.220
Now, I didn't see much reporting of this in the English-speaking press, oddly enough.

39:58.260 --> 40:03.220
I guess neo-Nazis don't sell as well as Islamic extremists or something.

40:03.220 --> 40:06.820
I mean, can you imagine if a bunch of Muslims had occupied the church?

40:06.820 --> 40:08.580
We'd never hear the fucking end of it.

40:09.220 --> 40:11.380
There's a double standard in the press.

40:12.900 --> 40:18.900
That's a bold statement there aimed at the five of you who hadn't already noticed that.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.220
So that's kind of funny, isn't it?

40:21.540 --> 40:24.980
The same church, even, like, two weeks beforehand.

40:25.620 --> 40:27.060
It's madness.

40:27.060 --> 40:29.060
Anyway, thanks for watching, everyone.

40:29.060 --> 40:34.260
I'd like to thank all of my supporters over on Patreon, who should be scrolling by right now,

40:34.260 --> 40:38.580
for being very kind and generous and enabling me to keep making videos.

40:38.580 --> 40:42.260
So a big heartfelt thank you to all of the names here.

40:43.220 --> 40:45.380
I love each and every one of you.

40:45.380 --> 40:49.540
And I'd like in particular to thank at RuneMian on Twitter again,

40:49.540 --> 40:52.980
who helped me out not only with translation work this time,

40:52.980 --> 40:57.380
but also stopped by the church in Dortmund to take a few photos for me,

40:57.380 --> 41:01.540
and also tipped me off to the earlier occupation of the church.

41:02.180 --> 41:04.180
So thank you at RuneMian.

41:04.180 --> 41:07.540
You win the incredibly helpful Person of the Month award.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.700
Anyway, bye for now.

41:09.700 --> 41:24.100
So yeah, you know, if you run out of bullets, you put a knife through somebody's eye to it.
