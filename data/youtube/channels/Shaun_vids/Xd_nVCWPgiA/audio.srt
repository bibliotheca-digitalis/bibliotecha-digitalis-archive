00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Hello everyone. Today we're going to be talking about a Stefan Molyneux video,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,600
the truth about the Native American genocide,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,120
which is just one in a series of videos that covers history, pop culture, public figures, you name it.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,000
And let's start off by watching just a short clip from the introduction to this particular video.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,800
Hi everybody, this is Stefan Molyneux from Free Domain Radio.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,720
I hope you're doing well, and I hope you're as sick and tired as I am of being lied to

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,440
about everything, all the time, your history is lied about in order to control your future.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,200
I'm sick and tired of it, and I'm going to help you break out of the matrix of Marxist delusions

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,720
that have birthed our self-destructive modern culture. So...

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
So, quite an intro there.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,080
And this is what I find interesting about Stefan's The Truth About series.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,120
He openly starts off with the assumption that the established and accepted history is a lie.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,480
The description to his video reads,

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,040
"...interactions between the early European settlers and America's native population

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,160
are often described using terms such as slaughter, genocide, and holocaust."

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,680
But what is the truth about the Native American genocide?

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,720
With the implication being that apparently terms like slaughter,

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,320
genocide, and holocaust could not possibly be the truth.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,720
You see, for Stefan, there was the actual true historical event,

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,760
and then that truth was perverted and warped by liberal, leftist, white-guilt, Marxist professor types

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,960
in order to control society, or whatever it is they do.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,800
And then after that comes Stefan, who's going to see through their lies and their ideology,

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,200
re-establish the truth, and thereby save the world, or something.

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,720
Now, just to lay all my cards on the table at the start here,

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,880
I don't agree with Stefan there, you might be surprised to hear.

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,240
For me, it goes, there was an actual historical event,

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,840
let's say the violence against the various Native American peoples by white people invading their lands.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,080
Then there were proposed justifications for that behavior

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,320
in an attempt to absolve the white folk of any guilt in the situation.

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,440
Then after that came the book-learning professor types,

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,160
who, through historical research and actually, you know, interviewing Native American people

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,480
and asking them about it, uncovered the truth of the situation.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,000
For white people, of course, the Native people already knew the truth of the situation.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,920
Then comes Stefan, who is fed up not with being lied to,

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,240
but that the truth is now being told, because it's a truth he doesn't want to hear.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,720
So he dismisses the modern historical consensus as a lie,

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,040
and tries to get us back to this point when white people were good and absolved of any wrongdoing ever.

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,640
And wouldn't that be nice?

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,200
So which of us is correct there?

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,320
Well, to find out, we're gonna take a look at Stefan's video.

41
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:57,240
That the established history is a lie is a pretty big claim and would require a lot of proof.

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,360
So we're gonna see what Stefan has to offer on that front.

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,960
And as always, except for the times when I forget to say this,

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,920
I recommend that you also watch his video so that you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting it.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,480
I'll put a link in the description below.

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,680
So, okay, welcome back, uh, quotes.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,600
And let's start off by giving a brief overview of Stefan's video.

48
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,640
Firstly, in the section titled Estimates,

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,800
Stefan lays out his best guess for the native population decline in numbers.

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,520
Then in the section titled Declines,

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,160
he argues that since there are more native people alive today than at his lowest estimate,

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,480
around 1880, that a genocide could therefore not have occurred.

53
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,800
Next, in the sections titled Disease, Empty and Effects of Disease,

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,120
he makes the case that a genocide could not have occurred

55
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,560
because the majority of Native American deaths were attributable to disease and starvation.

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,680
Then in the sections titled Warfare and Alliances,

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,960
he lists some native violence against the white population

58
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,760
and makes the case that any white violence was justified

59
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,480
by the fact they were at war with the natives.

60
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,800
So a genocide could not have occurred because the actions of any white people were, quote,

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,840
"...in conformity with the laws of war that were accepted at the time."

62
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,680
Now, you may have noticed there that Stefan's video is primarily concerned

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,800
with whether or not what happens to the Native Americans can technically be called genocide.

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,440
And there is much academic debate on that subject,

65
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,640
most of it boiling down to what particular definition of genocide one happens to be using.

66
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,160
Now, personally, I think it's something of a goalpost shift.

67
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,200
Stefan is hiding from the actual interesting question,

68
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,840
which is, was what happened to the Native Americans right or wrong,

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,800
by instead having the dictionary definition argument,

70
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,480
as if by potentially proving that what happened to the Native Americans

71
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,040
could not technically be called genocide,

72
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,440
it was therefore somehow justifiable.

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,520
Now, there's obviously a lot of moral ground between justifiable action and outright genocide,

74
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,200
of course, but Stefan's video is about the genocide question,

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,720
so that's what we're going to be attempting to answer too.

76
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,960
So then, was what happened to the Native Americans a genocide?

77
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,960
And there are three main points Stefan makes when answering this question.

78
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,360
He says no genocide could have occurred because not all Native people were killed,

79
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,360
most deaths were due to disease or starvation,

80
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,160
and white violence against the Natives was justified by the rules of warfare.

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,280
And we're going to go through these one by one in more detail.

82
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,200
But first off, we're going to read the legal definition of genocide from the UN,

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,520
so we know exactly what we're looking for.

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,440
Genocide is defined in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,400
of the Crime of Genocide, 1948, as,

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,200
quote,

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,440
"...any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part,

88
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,440
a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such,

89
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,720
killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group,

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,000
deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,800
to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part,

92
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,640
imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,

93
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,640
and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,200
So commit all that to memory, folks.

95
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,880
And okay, with that very lengthy introduction out of the way,

96
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,440
let's get to Stefan's arguments.

97
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,680
Firstly, the fact that not all Native people were killed.

98
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,440
Now in 2014, those who directly self-report as Native Americans

99
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,320
numbered just under three million people.

100
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:36,520
So, over a few hundred years, the European control of North America has increased

101
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,720
Native American genetic expression enormously.

102
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,440
Diluted, no question, but it has increased.

103
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,960
That is not technically, or even allegorically, genocide in any way.

104
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,280
Genocide is when the gene pool gets wiped out, not when it flourishes.

105
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,720
So here, Stefan is making the case that there are about three million

106
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,520
self-identified Native Americans in the US today,

107
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,680
as well as a varying amount of Natives contained within other racial populations,

108
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
whatever that's supposed to mean.

109
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,240
And he declares that a genocide could not have happened,

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,520
otherwise neither of these things would be the case.

111
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,680
And there's a few problems with that argument.

112
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,920
The first is that just because there are still Native Americans around today

113
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,840
doesn't necessarily mean a genocide could not have happened in the past.

114
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,480
The legal definition of genocide accounts for acts

115
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,040
committed with intent to destroy a people in whole or in part.

116
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,080
Not every single Native American person

117
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,360
would have to have been killed for it to count as a genocide.

118
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,920
As a comparison, in the year 1900,

119
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,800
there were around an estimated 11 million Jewish people living in the world.

120
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,520
Today, there are more than 14 million.

121
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,160
The number of Jewish people alive has increased over the last hundred years.

122
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,280
Does that mean that there could not have been a genocide

123
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,880
committed against Jewish people sometime in between those two dates?

124
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,000
Are we therefore to conclude the Holocaust could not have happened

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,040
simply because it did not kill every single Jewish person?

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Of course not, that's ridiculous.

127
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,000
And Stefan is talking about a history that is several centuries long.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,800
You can't just look at the starting population number and the ending population number

129
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,680
and conclude entirely from that that no genocide happened between those two times.

130
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,320
The next problem here is that Stefan is only considering race and genetics.

131
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,440
The legal definition of genocide also accounts for

132
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,440
attempts to destroy national, ethnical, and religious groups.

133
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,840
An important thing to remember here

134
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,120
is that Native Americans were not a single monolithic group.

135
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,440
There were many, many different groups of people

136
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,880
living under the umbrella term Native American.

137
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,320
An attempt to destroy any particular one of these groups

138
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,120
could be classified as genocidal in and of itself

139
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,160
without necessarily having to include wiping out everyone else of that racial group.

140
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,560
The Sand Creek Massacre in 1864, which we'll talk about later,

141
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,280
just to pick one example, was undoubtedly a singular genocidal act

142
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,800
even though the aim was only to kill the Native Americans present

143
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,680
rather than all Native Americans everywhere.

144
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,440
So I'm forced to conclude that these numbers are, to quote Stefan,

145
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,280
not an argument since with regards to our genocide question

146
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,120
it doesn't matter how many Native Americans still wear before colonization

147
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,000
or how many Native American people there are today.

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,720
Those numbers by themselves cannot tell us anything

149
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,440
about whether a genocide was committed in the interim.

150
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,800
Anyway, let's move on and talk about disease and starvation

151
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,280
and we'll tackle the most contentious issue first

152
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,920
which is the alleged use of smallpox blankets

153
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,560
to deliberately infect the Native population.

154
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,480
So deliberate infection from smallpox blankets.

155
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,320
Well, these are based entirely on two letters from British soldiers in 1763.

156
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,720
Not a government program, not a government policy,

157
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,880
no evidence that it was actually done.

158
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,120
Now, in 1763, this is long after smallpox had actually peaked

159
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,280
and there's no evidence of a significant outbreak

160
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,720
as a result of this vaguely theoretical bioweapon.

161
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,640
So first off here, where Stefan says the stories of deliberate infection

162
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,040
are based entirely on two letters from British soldiers in 1763.

163
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,760
That's a lie, unfortunately.

164
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,000
We do have a series of letters sent between General Geoffrey Amherst

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,760
and one of his colonels discussing a plan to deliberately spread smallpox

166
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,640
with infected blankets during the Siege of Fort Pitt in 1763.

167
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,040
During which Amherst states,

168
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,960
you will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets

169
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,920
as well as try every other method that can serve to extirpate this excreble race.

170
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,440
Extirpate meaning to exterminate there.

171
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,160
So there's no doubt what their intent was here.

172
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,800
Now, Stefan claims the stories of deliberate infection

173
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
stem entirely from these letters,

174
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,680
with there being no evidence such a thing was actually done.

175
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,600
However, over here in... reality,

176
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,080
we also have the journal of merchant and militia commander, William Trent,

177
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,800
who was at Fort Pitt and he writes of a parlay with the besieging native people.

178
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,320
Out of our regard to them, them being the natives there,

179
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,960
we gave them two blankets and a handkerchief out of the smallpox hospital.

180
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,600
I hope it will have the desired effect.

181
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,840
And we even have the army invoice for the blankets and handkerchief,

182
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,760
quote, taken from the people in the hospital to convey the smallpox to the Indians.

183
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,960
Now, either everyone in Fort Pitt decided to play a bit of a practical joke on later historians,

184
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,920
or, actually, their letters and records describe them doing a thing that they actually did.

185
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,800
And Stefan is elsewhere happy to accept letters from the time as being truthful.

186
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,280
In the section of his video titled Empty,

187
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,120
he quotes something a John Winthrop wrote without once noting that,

188
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,920
of course, this is just one letter, it's not necessarily truthful, etc.,

189
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,000
because that letter was saying something he thinks bolsters his argument.

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,720
When the letters say something he doesn't like, though,

191
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,760
oh, well, they're just letters, not actual evidence.

192
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,080
And one wonders what actual evidence Stefan is waiting for, really, from Fort Pitt in 1763.

193
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,920
Video footage, perhaps? Who knows.

194
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,320
Now, the effects of the deliberate infection attempt at Fort Pitt are, of course,

195
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,240
impossible to ascertain.

196
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,280
Any outbreak of smallpox after the blanket incident could have been unconnected to it.

197
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,720
Also impossible to ascertain is the frequency of this tactic,

198
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,040
though I'd personally say that the fact multiple people all spoke about the plan

199
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,080
without commenting on its unusualness or immorality

200
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,520
suggests it was a tactic that was at least known about beforehand,

201
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,640
even if it wasn't necessarily widely practiced.

202
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,840
However, with regards to our genocide question,

203
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,840
the efficacy of the blanket tactic doesn't actually matter.

204
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,160
The legal definition of genocide states,

205
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,840
any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy.

206
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,200
Intent.

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,520
They intentionally tried to spread disease in order to,

208
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,360
as General Amherst openly stated, exterminate a race.

209
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
It doesn't matter how well it worked.

210
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,680
You know, they don't get let off the hook for being bad at genocide.

211
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,840
What matters is that they tried to do it.

212
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,960
Let's move on and discuss the unintentional deaths by disease and its effects.

213
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,200
If you are infected with a disease,

214
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
you don't even know it, no one tells you about it,

215
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,960
there's no symptoms, nobody knows what's going on,

216
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,720
and you go and hug some family member,

217
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,800
and unknowingly, unwittingly infect that family member with your disease,

218
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,520
we would consider that a terrible tragedy.

219
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,040
We would not charge you with murder.

220
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,600
Come on, I mean, this is not that morally complicated.

221
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,120
Not that morally complicated, eh?

222
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,440
Well, we'll see about that.

223
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Stefan's little analogy there is pretty telling.

224
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,520
Throughout the sections of his video entitled Disease, Empty and Effects of Disease,

225
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,680
he repeatedly stresses the completely innocent and unintentional way

226
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,160
in which Native Americans contracted and died from various diseases.

227
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,560
After all, we can hardly blame the white settlers

228
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,240
for the diseases they passed on unintentionally, can we?

229
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,440
Things aren't that simple, unfortunately.

230
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,480
There's several factors that Stefan fails to either notice or mention here.

231
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,760
He treats every death from disease or its effects as a completely blameless accident.

232
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,360
And to examine this, we'll again use a comparison to the genocide carried out by Nazi Germany.

233
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,160
Many of the deaths in German concentration camps during the Second World War were due to disease,

234
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,360
and many of these could also be called unintentional.

235
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,880
In one sense, it wasn't as if the Nazis were deliberately infecting

236
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,240
each and every individual prisoner who died of disease.

237
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,240
Rather, the terrible conditions under which the Nazis forced their prisoners to exist

238
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,120
facilitated the easy spread of disease.

239
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,440
Malnourishment, close confinement, overwork, stress, denial of proper healthcare,

240
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,880
all these things can help disease to spread.

241
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,320
Now, the Nazis are, of course, still at fault for those deaths,

242
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,000
even though it was technically the disease and not them that did the killing.

243
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,720
My point here being that, of course, not all disease deaths are blameless,

244
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,480
even if the disease itself wasn't intentionally passed on.

245
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,640
So how applicable is this comparison to the treatment of Native Americans?

246
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,520
Could the actions of the white invaders have contributed to the spread of disease,

247
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,360
even unintentionally?

248
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,040
And to start to answer this, let's watch two little clips of Stefan here.

249
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,160
First up, from his section titled Effects of Disease.

250
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,480
And it wasn't just the direct effects of the disease, right?

251
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,240
So often, so many adult natives were incapacitated by disease

252
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,760
that the others, like the pregnant women, the children who relied on their food gathering,

253
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,200
died from starvation.

254
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,760
Sometimes, as many died from hunger as died from disease.

255
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,200
So Stefan is right there.

256
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,160
Often, it wasn't the disease that killed directly,

257
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,800
it just made it harder to hunt or gather food, which then led to starvation.

258
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,520
And this relationship also goes the other way.

259
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Malnourished bodies are less likely to fight off disease and infection,

260
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,280
and therefore lack of food facilitated the spread of disease.

261
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,440
And now let's watch the second clip from his segment entitled Alliances.

262
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,560
Now, whites who were unable to beat the natives on the plains

263
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,120
would wait till they went to ground for the winter,

264
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,760
and then would destroy the food stores during the winter.

265
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,960
And this was, in fact, the impetus for the initial reservation system.

266
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,640
Whites destroyed native food stores during winter.

267
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,960
Now, I trust most of you will have got the point already right now,

268
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,000
but just to make it clear, actions of the white European Americans,

269
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,240
such as burning the natives' food stores, helped disease to spread.

270
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,680
And as such, we can't designate all the deaths from disease or starvation as blameless,

271
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,720
as many of them may not have happened if it were not for the additional actions of the white people.

272
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,760
Now, destruction of material resources is one such action

273
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,360
that would encourage the spread of disease,

274
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,200
but others include the forced removal of native people from their lands.

275
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,880
For example, many of the deaths associated with the Trail of Tears

276
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,560
were due to disease or starvation.

277
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,480
The rounding up of native people into internment camps and so on,

278
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,280
these actions all helped disease to spread.

279
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,800
And I'd again like to make something clear here that Stefan doesn't mention,

280
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,560
whether deliberately or not.

281
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,680
The period of time he's talking about,

282
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,400
from when the first Europeans encountered native American people to the present day,

283
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,080
is several centuries long.

284
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,640
Not all disease deaths occurred at the initial moment of contact,

285
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,240
and often it was only later,

286
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,520
once the native peoples had been weakened, impoverished,

287
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,520
and rounded up into internment camps that epidemic diseases had the opportunity to spread.

288
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,480
In fact, not all disease deaths were even due to new diseases brought by the Europeans,

289
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,560
but rather existing diseases that the actions of the European Americans had made more dangerous.

290
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,600
Stefan's metaphor, in which one unintentionally gives someone else a disease which kills them,

291
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
with a hug, of all things,

292
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,480
is not really the most apt here.

293
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,120
A better metaphor would be one person imprisoning and starving another person

294
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,560
until they're so weak their body can no longer fight off disease.

295
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,520
And should that person then die of a disease,

296
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,120
how responsible would we say the imprisonment is?

297
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,240
Now, to be fair here, my metaphor there involves one person breaking the law.

298
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,280
And Stefan has claimed that whatever violent acts were committed against the Native Americans,

299
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,120
such as burning their food stores,

300
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,520
were justified by the laws of war that were accepted at the time.

301
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,520
So if that were true, my metaphor would also be a bad one.

302
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,840
So is Stefan right there?

303
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,200
We're now going to take a look at the sections of his video where he discusses

304
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,680
and attempts to justify the intentional violence inflicted upon the Native Americans.

305
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,840
Is it true that it was always justified by warfare?

306
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,040
Well, let's see.

307
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,520
And, of course, there are many different massacres and atrocities I could point to

308
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,200
and tell you about here where white people slaughtered defenseless,

309
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,840
peaceful Native people and destroyed their homes.

310
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,600
But I'll just do one.

311
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,840
The one I mentioned earlier.

312
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,160
Let's talk about the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864.

313
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,560
So way back in 1851, 13 years before the massacre,

314
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:31,480
the United States and several Native American tribes signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie,

315
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,720
in which the United States recognized large amounts of land as Native territory,

316
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,040
which they held no claim over.

317
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,080
This included parts of modern-day Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas.

318
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,000
So not exactly an insignificant amount of land there.

319
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,280
However, seven years later, in 1858,

320
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,800
gold was discovered in Colorado, triggering the Pike's Peak Gold Rush.

321
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,080
And that meant that a large amount of European American settlers

322
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,080
started violating the treaty and illegally moving into and settling on Native land.

323
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Stefan at one point mentions a similar series of events in California,

324
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,120
stating the discovery of gold in California exacerbated tensions.

325
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:21,400
Now, what exacerbated tensions means is trigger the genocide of the Native population

326
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,760
in what's known to history as the California genocide.

327
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,760
And even by the most conservative possible definition of the word genocide,

328
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,600
what happened in California undoubtedly qualifies.

329
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,680
Militia groups waged a war of extermination against the Native people,

330
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,040
often with implicit, and sometimes even explicit,

331
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,600
support from both the state and federal governments.

332
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,480
In 1851, California governor John McDougall announced his intent to make war upon the Indians,

333
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,000
which must, of necessity, be one of extermination to many of the tribes.

334
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,560
And if that's not outright genocidal intent,

335
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,320
I don't know what is.

336
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,360
So that's your exacerbated tensions there.

337
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,920
What a wonderfully cowardly revisionist fig leaf that phrase is.

338
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,120
Tom broke into Bill's house, murdered his family, and stole all of his possessions.

339
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,320
And that really exacerbated tensions between the two.

340
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,840
Anyway.

341
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,360
So back to the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1858.

342
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,960
After the discovery of gold in Colorado, there was a flood of European American settlers

343
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,640
illegally crossing into Native lands and exacerbating tensions all over the place.

344
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,480
Now, in an attempt to keep the peace,

345
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,040
a designation of chiefs from both the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes

346
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,720
signed the Treaty of Fort Wise, ceding to the United States

347
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,600
most of the lands they currently held claim to.

348
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,080
This new territory was less than one-thirteenth the size of the land claimed by them

349
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,960
in the Treaty of Fort Laramie a decade earlier.

350
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,840
So they forked over the vast majority of their lands in order to keep the peace with the states.

351
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,080
Among the Cheyenne chiefs who signed the treaty were Black Kettle,

352
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,720
White Antelope, and Lean Bear.

353
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,280
And they're important, so remember those names.

354
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,040
Sorry, I realize there's a lot of dry history recitation in this section,

355
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,000
but I promise it's all important for fully realizing

356
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,920
just how incredibly fucked the Sand Creek Massacre was.

357
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,320
So three years later, 1864, the year of the massacre,

358
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,800
Colorado troops under the command of US Army Colonel John Chivington

359
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:31,560
began, without any declaration of war, mind, or real reason, apparently,

360
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,360
attacking and destroying Cheyenne camps.

361
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,680
And on May 16th, 1864, a detachment of these soldiers

362
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,600
encountered a group of Native Americans in a buffalo hunting camp.

363
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,720
This group included Black Kettle and Lean Bear,

364
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,000
two of the chiefs who had three years ago signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States.

365
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,440
Lean Bear rode out to meet the soldiers, fully confident of a peaceful encounter.

366
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,840
You see, Lean Bear had previously met with President Lincoln in the White House

367
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,040
and carried with him documents signed by Lincoln

368
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,480
explaining he was a friend of the United States and was peaceful.

369
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,200
As he approached the soldiers, they opened fire and murdered him.

370
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,440
They were acting on orders from Chivington to kill every Cheyenne they encountered.

371
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,880
And to quote the man himself,

372
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,680
I have come to kill Indians and believe it's right and honorable

373
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,600
to use any means under God's heaven to kill Indians.

374
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,840
Kill and scalp all, big and little, knits make lice.

375
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,160
Pleasant chap there.

376
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,480
Anyway, tensions now very exacerbated.

377
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,360
The governor of Colorado, John Evans, sent a letter to the various local tribes

378
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,200
inviting all who desired peace to report to Fort Lyon

379
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,520
where they would be recognized as peaceful

380
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,960
and placed under the protection of the United States government.

381
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,080
Black Kettle then led a group of his people to Fort Lyon

382
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,120
where they were directed to settle at Sand Creek.

383
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,000
In the center of the camp, over his lodge,

384
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,240
Black Kettle flew an American flag with a white flag tied beneath it

385
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,720
to signal they were peaceful and under the protection of the United States.

386
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,320
The majority of people present at the camp were women and children

387
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,120
as most of the warriors were away hunting.

388
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,480
So let's just recap how these people got here.

389
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,520
Two times they had signed treaties with the United States

390
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,160
and two times people from the United States had violated those treaties,

391
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,200
invaded their lands, and killed their people.

392
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,320
The natives had signed away most of their remaining lands

393
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,280
attempting to keep the peace with the United States.

394
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,720
Lean Bear, one of their chiefs, was murdered in cold blood

395
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,120
attempting to keep peace with the United States.

396
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,920
And now finally they had surrendered themselves to the mercy of the United States,

397
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,440
settled where they were told to,

398
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,320
and were fully under the impression that they were at peace

399
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,280
and had been guaranteed protection and safety.

400
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,360
Now, uh, content warning for this next bit.

401
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,920
I'm about to read some pretty nasty stuff.

402
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,560
If you're bothered by descriptions of violence, I'd skip ahead a little ways.

403
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,320
So okay, on November 29th, 1864,

404
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,760
Colonel Chivington had a detachment of his men surround the camp at Sand Creek with guns

405
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
and ordered them to open fire.

406
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,560
The women and children in the camp gathered around the American flag above Black Kettle's Lodge.

407
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,160
White Antelope, one of the chiefs I mentioned earlier,

408
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,320
was shot down as he approached the troops,

409
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,480
shouting for them to stop firing.

410
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,400
His body was later mutilated,

411
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,720
he was scalped and had his nose, ears, and genitals cut off.

412
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,240
The soldiers then moved into the camp with rifles and sabers

413
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,560
and massacred everyone they could.

414
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,440
Witness accounts speak of scalped children,

415
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,680
children with their brains knocked out,

416
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,520
pregnant women being cut open,

417
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,200
children being used as target practice by the soldiers,

418
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,760
mutilated corpses,

419
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,080
all manner of dreadful things like that.

420
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,520
More than 100 people were murdered at Sand Creek,

421
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,680
the majority women and children,

422
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,120
and all of them peaceful.

423
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,400
Black Kettle, the chief, managed to escape the camp

424
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,400
and somehow remained dedicated to achieving a lasting peace

425
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,680
right up until 1868 when he was shot in the back

426
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,520
and killed by US Army soldiers when he was crossing a river.

427
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,800
Chivington, the colonel who orchestrated the massacre,

428
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,120
never faced criminal charges.

429
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,480
So what does this guy have to say about Sand Creek,

430
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,360
or indeed any massacre or atrocity carried out against the Native Americans?

431
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,000
Well, absolutely nothing.

432
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,800
Stefan deals with the issue by just not mentioning it at all,

433
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,320
besides one passing reference to there being examples of cruelty on both sides.

434
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,840
There's no mention of Wounded Knee or Sand Creek or any other atrocity.

435
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,400
In fact, actually in a video entitled

436
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,960
The Truth About the Native American Genocide,

437
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Stefan never once names or quotes a Native American person.

438
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,120
Does that seem odd to you?

439
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,640
Because it should.

440
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,600
How can a video profess to tell the truth about history

441
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,960
while completely ignoring one side of the history?

442
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,080
Stefan only talks about white violence against the Natives

443
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,560
when he thinks he can justify it.

444
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,200
And let's have a listen to him attempt to do that.

445
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,160
Now say what you like.

446
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,600
These actions were almost certainly in conformity with the laws of the war

447
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,800
that were accepted at the time.

448
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,320
The villagers of warring Natives who refused to surrender

449
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,560
were viewed as legitimate military targets and could be acted against,

450
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,120
and this of course occurred significantly later

451
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,080
when Churchill bombed the Germans and so on.

452
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,440
So like it or not, those are part of the rules of war at the time

453
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,800
and considerably thereafter.

454
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,040
So Stefan's argument is weak here, of course,

455
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,880
because there is no good argument in defense of what he's trying to defend.

456
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,640
He compares the destruction of Native American food stores

457
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,880
and villages to the Allied bombing of German cities in World War II,

458
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
which is a bit silly for several reasons.

459
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,400
Firstly, that Allied bombing of German cities

460
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,640
is actually a rather contentious issue.

461
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,560
But regardless of that, whatever your opinion of Churchill

462
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
or the actions of the Allied forces,

463
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,320
they were at the very least fighting against an expansionist,

464
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,280
genocidal fascist state that would have invaded

465
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,240
and conquered their countries if it had the opportunity.

466
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,360
The white people in America were fighting against

467
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,880
some Native people whose land they wanted to steal.

468
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,360
And Stefan's metaphor further casts the Native Americans as the Nazis,

469
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,920
which, you know, piss off.

470
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,360
The other way Stefan's argument is weak here is that throughout this section,

471
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,080
he mentions several instances of Native violence against white people.

472
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,960
And he's saying, this is what was normal at the time.

473
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,280
You can't blame anyone in particular for that.

474
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,480
It wasn't just the white people doing the violence.

475
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,560
Mom, mom, they did it too.

476
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,520
You know, it's a childish argument of moral equivalence there.

477
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,400
And I thought it was the leftist Marxist professor types

478
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,880
who went in for all that stuff, not you, Stefan.

479
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,640
Anyway, attempting to equate the violence of the Natives

480
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,640
with the violence of the European Americans is wrong for a few reasons.

481
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,000
Mainly, obviously, the scale.

482
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,720
The whites had cannons and rifles and organized military.

483
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,240
They had a much greater ability to inflict violence.

484
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,800
But even if we ignore that material inequality

485
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,960
and we give Native people all the same equipment

486
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,080
and assume an equal number of people killed on each side,

487
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,680
one side was still fighting to defend their lands from invasion

488
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,880
and the other side was the one doing the invading.

489
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,440
The Native people always come out morally superior if that's how we're measuring it.

490
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,760
The other odd thing about Stefan's argument here

491
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,760
is that he, in his introduction, mentions the superiority of white Western civilization.

492
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,040
That is, of course, what he's trying to preserve and defend,

493
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,720
the idea that white Western European people are superior.

494
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,520
Though I'm sure he wouldn't put it quite that bluntly.

495
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,360
This moral equivalence argument from later in his video

496
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,400
is completely at odds with that idea, however.

497
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,040
If you're trying to argue Western Europeans are supposedly a superior people,

498
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,520
then that's what you have to prove.

499
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,280
Moral superiority, not moral equivalence,

500
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,920
but they did it too, isn't a good enough argument, Stefan.

501
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,400
Anyway, we're getting pretty close to wrapping up now,

502
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,680
but before we do, I'd like to touch on a few more aspects

503
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,360
of the genocide debate that Stefan doesn't mention in his video.

504
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,840
And they relate to the following section of the UN's legal definition of genocide.

505
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,480
And I quote,

506
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,040
"...imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,

507
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,800
and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

508
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,080
Both these things can be classified as genocide."

509
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,880
So first up, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.

510
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,600
So, in the 1960s and 70s, the United States Indian Health Service

511
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,720
sterilized thousands of Native American women,

512
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,040
often without their consent, and sometimes without even their knowledge.

513
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,760
And well, that's all I have to say about that, really.

514
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,960
It so perfectly fits the exact legal definition there

515
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,360
that I don't really need to elaborate, I don't think.

516
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,720
Yes, that really happened, and no, Stefan doesn't mention it.

517
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,440
Next up is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

518
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,800
Well, I won't dwell on this,

519
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,440
but let's briefly talk about the Canadian-Indian residential school system.

520
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
So this was a system of boarding schools

521
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,360
that indigenous children were required to attend.

522
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,520
The purpose of these schools was to, quote,

523
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,640
"...kill the Indian to save the man."

524
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,280
A quote from a chap called Richard Henry Pratt there,

525
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,840
who founded the first such boarding school.

526
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,240
And these schools were notoriously harsh and brutal places to be.

527
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,960
They were located far from reservations,

528
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,640
so that the children would have little contact with their families or culture,

529
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,280
and thus separated, the children were forced to speak another language,

530
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,480
and the practice of native cultural activities was banned,

531
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,920
with corporal punishment being used to enforce these rules.

532
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,320
These schools, the purpose of which was obviously to eradicate native culture

533
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,160
and replace it with the dominant culture,

534
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,720
were operated into the 1980s.

535
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,600
And several apologies have since been issued

536
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,920
by the Canadian government on the matter.

537
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,120
So, there we go.

538
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,640
Two examples there of acts that can be called genocidal,

539
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,240
continuing into very recent times, only a few decades ago.

540
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,040
Stefan doesn't consider these factors.

541
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,480
Perhaps they don't meet his definition of genocide,

542
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,720
but it's worthwhile asking here,

543
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,200
what is Stefan's definition of genocide as presented in this video?

544
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,720
He seems to think that the only acceptable definition of genocide

545
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,280
is the total unanimous and unceasing attempt of one people

546
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,720
to wipe out another people.

547
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,160
And is that a reasonable definition?

548
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,560
I'll leave that up to you to decide.

549
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,120
So, we're back to arguing definitions of genocide again.

550
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,520
And I suppose much of the debate depends upon

551
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,680
whether you believe genocide describes the intent or the result.

552
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,480
Of course, for the most part, the United States wanted territorial expansion,

553
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,440
and it was willing to use genocide as both a threat

554
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,000
and a practical weapon to achieve that goal.

555
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,120
Stefan at one point mentions Thomas Jefferson's attempts

556
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,600
to inoculate natives against disease,

557
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,400
but even Jefferson, in other circumstances,

558
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,040
was willing to threaten native people with genocide.

559
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,200
In 1807, he wrote,

560
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,480
So, genocide was clearly on the table then,

561
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,000
at least as a threat.

562
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,280
And it's genocide as a means rather than an end,

563
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,520
but is that still genocide?

564
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,600
Well, personally, I've seen it argued that

565
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,280
ethnic cleansing is a more generally appropriate term here,

566
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,920
though I'd still argue that the history is peppered with,

567
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,800
at the very least, genocidal moments, genocidal incidents,

568
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,120
even if genocide wasn't continuous and unceasing government policy

569
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,800
throughout the whole period.

570
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,200
But regardless of how we classify it,

571
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,760
and this is going all the way back to the start of the video here,

572
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,720
Regardless of how we classify the actions

573
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,200
of the invading European Americans,

574
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,560
how they treated the Native Americans was, for the most part,

575
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,680
completely unjustified, morally wrong,

576
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,640
and only defensible if you, as Stefan does,

577
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,920
completely ignore the majority of the actual history.

578
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,440
I'd like to end today with a brief note about white guilt.

579
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,160
That being what Stefan says is behind the attempts

580
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,840
to distort the true history in which white people were always great.

581
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,120
Lawrence Southern has also used this excuse

582
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,840
to explain some of the horrible stuff she believes.

583
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,840
White people hate themselves and are so guilty about the sins of the past

584
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,360
that they're ignoring reality and deluding themselves in the present.

585
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,400
And, well, it's not true.

586
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,680
Now, I'm not saying white guilt is impossible as a concept,

587
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,920
just that people like Stefan and Lawrence Southern aren't applying it correctly.

588
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,880
Reading the history of what happened to the Native Americans,

589
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,640
I was often outraged, sometimes disgusted,

590
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,280
but I never felt personally guilty,

591
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,400
just saddened by what people can do to one another.

592
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,720
Acknowledging offense from the past

593
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,840
in which white people have been in the wrong isn't driven by guilt,

594
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,440
just honesty.

595
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,320
Understanding is not guilt.

596
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,120
Hiding from the historical record,

597
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,360
cherry-picking from it,

598
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,400
whitewashing it to erase atrocities committed,

599
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,680
well, that's real guilt in action right there.

600
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,040
Thanks for watching, everyone.

601
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,400
Like, subscribe, leave a comment,

602
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,720
and basically just have a grand old time interacting with YouTube right there.

603
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,600
Thanks especially, as always, to my supporters on Patreon,

604
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,400
who enable me to keep making videos like this.

605
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,320
We're closing in on our next goal, which is scary,

606
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,360
so head over there and check it out, if you feel like.

607
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,080
I'm also thinking of doing another Q&A video for 25k subscribers,

608
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,920
which should be coming up fairly soon.

609
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
So if you want to ask a question,

610
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,480
send it me over on Curious Cat,

611
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,600
and make sure to sign a name at the bottom if you want a name read out,

612
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,960
and put for your Q&A video at the top or something,

613
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,680
so I know it's not just a regular question.

614
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,280
Okay, folks, thanks a lot, and I'll see you next time.
