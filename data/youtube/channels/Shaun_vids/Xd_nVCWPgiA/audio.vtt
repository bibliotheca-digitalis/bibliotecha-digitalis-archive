00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Hello everyone. Today we're going to be talking about a Stefan Molyneux video,

00:04.680 --> 00:07.600
the truth about the Native American genocide,

00:07.600 --> 00:14.120
which is just one in a series of videos that covers history, pop culture, public figures, you name it.

00:14.120 --> 00:19.000
And let's start off by watching just a short clip from the introduction to this particular video.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.800
Hi everybody, this is Stefan Molyneux from Free Domain Radio.

00:21.800 --> 00:27.720
I hope you're doing well, and I hope you're as sick and tired as I am of being lied to

00:27.760 --> 00:33.440
about everything, all the time, your history is lied about in order to control your future.

00:33.440 --> 00:39.200
I'm sick and tired of it, and I'm going to help you break out of the matrix of Marxist delusions

00:39.200 --> 00:42.720
that have birthed our self-destructive modern culture. So...

00:43.440 --> 00:45.120
So, quite an intro there.

00:45.120 --> 00:49.080
And this is what I find interesting about Stefan's The Truth About series.

00:49.080 --> 00:55.120
He openly starts off with the assumption that the established and accepted history is a lie.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.480
The description to his video reads,

00:57.480 --> 01:02.040
"...interactions between the early European settlers and America's native population

01:02.040 --> 01:07.160
are often described using terms such as slaughter, genocide, and holocaust."

01:07.160 --> 01:10.680
But what is the truth about the Native American genocide?

01:10.680 --> 01:13.720
With the implication being that apparently terms like slaughter,

01:13.720 --> 01:17.320
genocide, and holocaust could not possibly be the truth.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.720
You see, for Stefan, there was the actual true historical event,

01:21.800 --> 01:28.760
and then that truth was perverted and warped by liberal, leftist, white-guilt, Marxist professor types

01:28.760 --> 01:31.960
in order to control society, or whatever it is they do.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.800
And then after that comes Stefan, who's going to see through their lies and their ideology,

01:37.800 --> 01:42.200
re-establish the truth, and thereby save the world, or something.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.720
Now, just to lay all my cards on the table at the start here,

01:45.720 --> 01:49.880
I don't agree with Stefan there, you might be surprised to hear.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.240
For me, it goes, there was an actual historical event,

01:53.240 --> 01:58.840
let's say the violence against the various Native American peoples by white people invading their lands.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.080
Then there were proposed justifications for that behavior

02:03.080 --> 02:07.320
in an attempt to absolve the white folk of any guilt in the situation.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.440
Then after that came the book-learning professor types,

02:10.440 --> 02:15.160
who, through historical research and actually, you know, interviewing Native American people

02:15.160 --> 02:19.480
and asking them about it, uncovered the truth of the situation.

02:20.200 --> 02:25.000
For white people, of course, the Native people already knew the truth of the situation.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.920
Then comes Stefan, who is fed up not with being lied to,

02:28.920 --> 02:33.240
but that the truth is now being told, because it's a truth he doesn't want to hear.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.720
So he dismisses the modern historical consensus as a lie,

02:37.720 --> 02:44.040
and tries to get us back to this point when white people were good and absolved of any wrongdoing ever.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.640
And wouldn't that be nice?

02:45.640 --> 02:48.200
So which of us is correct there?

02:48.200 --> 02:51.320
Well, to find out, we're gonna take a look at Stefan's video.

02:51.320 --> 02:57.240
That the established history is a lie is a pretty big claim and would require a lot of proof.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.360
So we're gonna see what Stefan has to offer on that front.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.960
And as always, except for the times when I forget to say this,

03:03.960 --> 03:08.920
I recommend that you also watch his video so that you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting it.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.480
I'll put a link in the description below.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.680
So, okay, welcome back, uh, quotes.

03:14.920 --> 03:18.600
And let's start off by giving a brief overview of Stefan's video.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.640
Firstly, in the section titled Estimates,

03:21.640 --> 03:25.800
Stefan lays out his best guess for the native population decline in numbers.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.520
Then in the section titled Declines,

03:28.520 --> 03:33.160
he argues that since there are more native people alive today than at his lowest estimate,

03:33.160 --> 03:37.480
around 1880, that a genocide could therefore not have occurred.

03:37.480 --> 03:41.800
Next, in the sections titled Disease, Empty and Effects of Disease,

03:41.800 --> 03:44.120
he makes the case that a genocide could not have occurred

03:44.120 --> 03:49.560
because the majority of Native American deaths were attributable to disease and starvation.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.680
Then in the sections titled Warfare and Alliances,

03:52.680 --> 03:55.960
he lists some native violence against the white population

03:55.960 --> 03:58.760
and makes the case that any white violence was justified

03:58.760 --> 04:01.480
by the fact they were at war with the natives.

04:01.480 --> 04:05.800
So a genocide could not have occurred because the actions of any white people were, quote,

04:06.360 --> 04:10.840
"...in conformity with the laws of war that were accepted at the time."

04:10.840 --> 04:14.680
Now, you may have noticed there that Stefan's video is primarily concerned

04:14.680 --> 04:19.800
with whether or not what happens to the Native Americans can technically be called genocide.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.440
And there is much academic debate on that subject,

04:22.440 --> 04:27.640
most of it boiling down to what particular definition of genocide one happens to be using.

04:27.640 --> 04:31.160
Now, personally, I think it's something of a goalpost shift.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.200
Stefan is hiding from the actual interesting question,

04:34.200 --> 04:38.840
which is, was what happened to the Native Americans right or wrong,

04:38.840 --> 04:41.800
by instead having the dictionary definition argument,

04:41.800 --> 04:45.480
as if by potentially proving that what happened to the Native Americans

04:45.480 --> 04:48.040
could not technically be called genocide,

04:48.040 --> 04:50.440
it was therefore somehow justifiable.

04:50.440 --> 04:56.520
Now, there's obviously a lot of moral ground between justifiable action and outright genocide,

04:56.520 --> 05:00.200
of course, but Stefan's video is about the genocide question,

05:00.200 --> 05:03.720
so that's what we're going to be attempting to answer too.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.960
So then, was what happened to the Native Americans a genocide?

05:08.040 --> 05:11.960
And there are three main points Stefan makes when answering this question.

05:11.960 --> 05:16.360
He says no genocide could have occurred because not all Native people were killed,

05:17.080 --> 05:20.360
most deaths were due to disease or starvation,

05:20.360 --> 05:25.160
and white violence against the Natives was justified by the rules of warfare.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.280
And we're going to go through these one by one in more detail.

05:28.280 --> 05:32.200
But first off, we're going to read the legal definition of genocide from the UN,

05:32.200 --> 05:34.520
so we know exactly what we're looking for.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.440
Genocide is defined in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment

05:38.440 --> 05:41.400
of the Crime of Genocide, 1948, as,

05:41.400 --> 05:42.200
quote,

05:42.200 --> 05:46.440
"...any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part,

05:46.440 --> 05:50.440
a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such,

05:50.440 --> 05:55.720
killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group,

05:55.720 --> 05:59.000
deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated

05:59.000 --> 06:01.800
to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part,

06:02.520 --> 06:05.640
imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,

06:06.200 --> 06:09.640
and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."

06:09.640 --> 06:12.200
So commit all that to memory, folks.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.880
And okay, with that very lengthy introduction out of the way,

06:15.880 --> 06:18.440
let's get to Stefan's arguments.

06:18.440 --> 06:22.680
Firstly, the fact that not all Native people were killed.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.440
Now in 2014, those who directly self-report as Native Americans

06:26.440 --> 06:29.320
numbered just under three million people.

06:29.320 --> 06:36.520
So, over a few hundred years, the European control of North America has increased

06:36.520 --> 06:39.720
Native American genetic expression enormously.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.440
Diluted, no question, but it has increased.

06:42.440 --> 06:47.960
That is not technically, or even allegorically, genocide in any way.

06:47.960 --> 06:52.280
Genocide is when the gene pool gets wiped out, not when it flourishes.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.720
So here, Stefan is making the case that there are about three million

06:55.720 --> 06:58.520
self-identified Native Americans in the US today,

06:58.520 --> 07:04.680
as well as a varying amount of Natives contained within other racial populations,

07:04.680 --> 07:06.040
whatever that's supposed to mean.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.240
And he declares that a genocide could not have happened,

07:09.240 --> 07:12.520
otherwise neither of these things would be the case.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.680
And there's a few problems with that argument.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.920
The first is that just because there are still Native Americans around today

07:18.920 --> 07:22.840
doesn't necessarily mean a genocide could not have happened in the past.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.480
The legal definition of genocide accounts for acts

07:25.480 --> 07:30.040
committed with intent to destroy a people in whole or in part.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.080
Not every single Native American person

07:33.080 --> 07:36.360
would have to have been killed for it to count as a genocide.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.920
As a comparison, in the year 1900,

07:38.920 --> 07:43.800
there were around an estimated 11 million Jewish people living in the world.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.520
Today, there are more than 14 million.

07:46.520 --> 07:51.160
The number of Jewish people alive has increased over the last hundred years.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.280
Does that mean that there could not have been a genocide

07:54.280 --> 07:57.880
committed against Jewish people sometime in between those two dates?

07:57.880 --> 08:01.000
Are we therefore to conclude the Holocaust could not have happened

08:01.000 --> 08:04.040
simply because it did not kill every single Jewish person?

08:04.600 --> 08:06.600
Of course not, that's ridiculous.

08:06.600 --> 08:11.000
And Stefan is talking about a history that is several centuries long.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.800
You can't just look at the starting population number and the ending population number

08:15.800 --> 08:20.680
and conclude entirely from that that no genocide happened between those two times.

08:20.680 --> 08:25.320
The next problem here is that Stefan is only considering race and genetics.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.440
The legal definition of genocide also accounts for

08:28.440 --> 08:32.440
attempts to destroy national, ethnical, and religious groups.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.840
An important thing to remember here

08:34.840 --> 08:38.120
is that Native Americans were not a single monolithic group.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.440
There were many, many different groups of people

08:40.440 --> 08:43.880
living under the umbrella term Native American.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.320
An attempt to destroy any particular one of these groups

08:47.320 --> 08:50.120
could be classified as genocidal in and of itself

08:50.120 --> 08:55.160
without necessarily having to include wiping out everyone else of that racial group.

08:55.160 --> 08:59.560
The Sand Creek Massacre in 1864, which we'll talk about later,

08:59.560 --> 09:04.280
just to pick one example, was undoubtedly a singular genocidal act

09:04.280 --> 09:07.800
even though the aim was only to kill the Native Americans present

09:07.800 --> 09:10.680
rather than all Native Americans everywhere.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.440
So I'm forced to conclude that these numbers are, to quote Stefan,

09:14.440 --> 09:18.280
not an argument since with regards to our genocide question

09:18.280 --> 09:22.120
it doesn't matter how many Native Americans still wear before colonization

09:22.120 --> 09:25.000
or how many Native American people there are today.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.720
Those numbers by themselves cannot tell us anything

09:27.720 --> 09:30.440
about whether a genocide was committed in the interim.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.800
Anyway, let's move on and talk about disease and starvation

09:33.800 --> 09:36.280
and we'll tackle the most contentious issue first

09:36.280 --> 09:38.920
which is the alleged use of smallpox blankets

09:38.920 --> 09:41.560
to deliberately infect the Native population.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.480
So deliberate infection from smallpox blankets.

09:45.560 --> 09:49.320
Well, these are based entirely on two letters from British soldiers in 1763.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.720
Not a government program, not a government policy,

09:51.720 --> 09:53.880
no evidence that it was actually done.

09:53.880 --> 09:58.120
Now, in 1763, this is long after smallpox had actually peaked

09:58.120 --> 10:00.280
and there's no evidence of a significant outbreak

10:00.280 --> 10:03.720
as a result of this vaguely theoretical bioweapon.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.640
So first off here, where Stefan says the stories of deliberate infection

10:07.640 --> 10:12.040
are based entirely on two letters from British soldiers in 1763.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.760
That's a lie, unfortunately.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.000
We do have a series of letters sent between General Geoffrey Amherst

10:19.000 --> 10:22.760
and one of his colonels discussing a plan to deliberately spread smallpox

10:22.760 --> 10:27.640
with infected blankets during the Siege of Fort Pitt in 1763.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.040
During which Amherst states,

10:30.040 --> 10:33.960
you will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets

10:33.960 --> 10:38.920
as well as try every other method that can serve to extirpate this excreble race.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.440
Extirpate meaning to exterminate there.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.160
So there's no doubt what their intent was here.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.800
Now, Stefan claims the stories of deliberate infection

10:47.800 --> 10:49.800
stem entirely from these letters,

10:49.800 --> 10:52.680
with there being no evidence such a thing was actually done.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.600
However, over here in... reality,

10:56.600 --> 11:01.080
we also have the journal of merchant and militia commander, William Trent,

11:01.080 --> 11:05.800
who was at Fort Pitt and he writes of a parlay with the besieging native people.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.320
Out of our regard to them, them being the natives there,

11:09.320 --> 11:13.960
we gave them two blankets and a handkerchief out of the smallpox hospital.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.600
I hope it will have the desired effect.

11:16.600 --> 11:20.840
And we even have the army invoice for the blankets and handkerchief,

11:20.840 --> 11:26.760
quote, taken from the people in the hospital to convey the smallpox to the Indians.

11:26.760 --> 11:31.960
Now, either everyone in Fort Pitt decided to play a bit of a practical joke on later historians,

11:31.960 --> 11:36.920
or, actually, their letters and records describe them doing a thing that they actually did.

11:37.560 --> 11:41.800
And Stefan is elsewhere happy to accept letters from the time as being truthful.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.280
In the section of his video titled Empty,

11:44.280 --> 11:48.120
he quotes something a John Winthrop wrote without once noting that,

11:48.120 --> 11:52.920
of course, this is just one letter, it's not necessarily truthful, etc.,

11:52.920 --> 11:57.000
because that letter was saying something he thinks bolsters his argument.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.720
When the letters say something he doesn't like, though,

11:59.720 --> 12:02.760
oh, well, they're just letters, not actual evidence.

12:02.760 --> 12:09.080
And one wonders what actual evidence Stefan is waiting for, really, from Fort Pitt in 1763.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.920
Video footage, perhaps? Who knows.

12:12.920 --> 12:17.320
Now, the effects of the deliberate infection attempt at Fort Pitt are, of course,

12:17.320 --> 12:19.240
impossible to ascertain.

12:19.240 --> 12:24.280
Any outbreak of smallpox after the blanket incident could have been unconnected to it.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.720
Also impossible to ascertain is the frequency of this tactic,

12:27.720 --> 12:32.040
though I'd personally say that the fact multiple people all spoke about the plan

12:32.040 --> 12:35.080
without commenting on its unusualness or immorality

12:35.080 --> 12:38.520
suggests it was a tactic that was at least known about beforehand,

12:38.520 --> 12:41.640
even if it wasn't necessarily widely practiced.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.840
However, with regards to our genocide question,

12:44.840 --> 12:48.840
the efficacy of the blanket tactic doesn't actually matter.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.160
The legal definition of genocide states,

12:51.160 --> 12:54.840
any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy.

12:55.640 --> 12:56.200
Intent.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.520
They intentionally tried to spread disease in order to,

13:00.520 --> 13:04.360
as General Amherst openly stated, exterminate a race.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.920
It doesn't matter how well it worked.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.680
You know, they don't get let off the hook for being bad at genocide.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.840
What matters is that they tried to do it.

13:13.400 --> 13:17.960
Let's move on and discuss the unintentional deaths by disease and its effects.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.200
If you are infected with a disease,

13:20.760 --> 13:22.760
you don't even know it, no one tells you about it,

13:22.760 --> 13:25.960
there's no symptoms, nobody knows what's going on,

13:25.960 --> 13:27.720
and you go and hug some family member,

13:28.600 --> 13:33.800
and unknowingly, unwittingly infect that family member with your disease,

13:33.800 --> 13:36.520
we would consider that a terrible tragedy.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.040
We would not charge you with murder.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.600
Come on, I mean, this is not that morally complicated.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.120
Not that morally complicated, eh?

13:45.080 --> 13:46.440
Well, we'll see about that.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.200
Stefan's little analogy there is pretty telling.

13:50.200 --> 13:54.520
Throughout the sections of his video entitled Disease, Empty and Effects of Disease,

13:54.600 --> 13:58.680
he repeatedly stresses the completely innocent and unintentional way

13:58.680 --> 14:03.160
in which Native Americans contracted and died from various diseases.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.560
After all, we can hardly blame the white settlers

14:05.560 --> 14:09.240
for the diseases they passed on unintentionally, can we?

14:10.040 --> 14:12.440
Things aren't that simple, unfortunately.

14:12.440 --> 14:17.480
There's several factors that Stefan fails to either notice or mention here.

14:17.480 --> 14:22.760
He treats every death from disease or its effects as a completely blameless accident.

14:23.320 --> 14:28.360
And to examine this, we'll again use a comparison to the genocide carried out by Nazi Germany.

14:28.360 --> 14:33.160
Many of the deaths in German concentration camps during the Second World War were due to disease,

14:33.720 --> 14:36.360
and many of these could also be called unintentional.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.880
In one sense, it wasn't as if the Nazis were deliberately infecting

14:39.880 --> 14:43.240
each and every individual prisoner who died of disease.

14:43.880 --> 14:49.240
Rather, the terrible conditions under which the Nazis forced their prisoners to exist

14:49.240 --> 14:52.120
facilitated the easy spread of disease.

14:52.200 --> 14:58.440
Malnourishment, close confinement, overwork, stress, denial of proper healthcare,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.880
all these things can help disease to spread.

15:01.880 --> 15:05.320
Now, the Nazis are, of course, still at fault for those deaths,

15:05.320 --> 15:09.000
even though it was technically the disease and not them that did the killing.

15:09.640 --> 15:13.720
My point here being that, of course, not all disease deaths are blameless,

15:13.720 --> 15:17.480
even if the disease itself wasn't intentionally passed on.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.640
So how applicable is this comparison to the treatment of Native Americans?

15:22.120 --> 15:26.520
Could the actions of the white invaders have contributed to the spread of disease,

15:26.520 --> 15:28.360
even unintentionally?

15:28.360 --> 15:32.040
And to start to answer this, let's watch two little clips of Stefan here.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.160
First up, from his section titled Effects of Disease.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.480
And it wasn't just the direct effects of the disease, right?

15:39.480 --> 15:43.240
So often, so many adult natives were incapacitated by disease

15:43.240 --> 15:46.760
that the others, like the pregnant women, the children who relied on their food gathering,

15:46.760 --> 15:48.200
died from starvation.

15:48.200 --> 15:52.760
Sometimes, as many died from hunger as died from disease.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.200
So Stefan is right there.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.160
Often, it wasn't the disease that killed directly,

15:57.160 --> 16:01.800
it just made it harder to hunt or gather food, which then led to starvation.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.520
And this relationship also goes the other way.

16:04.520 --> 16:08.520
Malnourished bodies are less likely to fight off disease and infection,

16:08.520 --> 16:12.280
and therefore lack of food facilitated the spread of disease.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.440
And now let's watch the second clip from his segment entitled Alliances.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.560
Now, whites who were unable to beat the natives on the plains

16:21.560 --> 16:24.120
would wait till they went to ground for the winter,

16:24.120 --> 16:28.760
and then would destroy the food stores during the winter.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.960
And this was, in fact, the impetus for the initial reservation system.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.640
Whites destroyed native food stores during winter.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.960
Now, I trust most of you will have got the point already right now,

16:39.960 --> 16:45.000
but just to make it clear, actions of the white European Americans,

16:45.000 --> 16:49.240
such as burning the natives' food stores, helped disease to spread.

16:49.800 --> 16:54.680
And as such, we can't designate all the deaths from disease or starvation as blameless,

16:54.680 --> 16:59.720
as many of them may not have happened if it were not for the additional actions of the white people.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.760
Now, destruction of material resources is one such action

17:02.760 --> 17:04.360
that would encourage the spread of disease,

17:04.360 --> 17:08.200
but others include the forced removal of native people from their lands.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.880
For example, many of the deaths associated with the Trail of Tears

17:11.880 --> 17:13.560
were due to disease or starvation.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.480
The rounding up of native people into internment camps and so on,

17:17.480 --> 17:20.280
these actions all helped disease to spread.

17:20.280 --> 17:23.800
And I'd again like to make something clear here that Stefan doesn't mention,

17:23.800 --> 17:25.560
whether deliberately or not.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.680
The period of time he's talking about,

17:28.680 --> 17:33.400
from when the first Europeans encountered native American people to the present day,

17:33.400 --> 17:35.080
is several centuries long.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.640
Not all disease deaths occurred at the initial moment of contact,

17:39.640 --> 17:41.240
and often it was only later,

17:41.240 --> 17:44.520
once the native peoples had been weakened, impoverished,

17:44.520 --> 17:50.520
and rounded up into internment camps that epidemic diseases had the opportunity to spread.

17:50.520 --> 17:55.480
In fact, not all disease deaths were even due to new diseases brought by the Europeans,

17:55.480 --> 18:01.560
but rather existing diseases that the actions of the European Americans had made more dangerous.

18:01.560 --> 18:06.600
Stefan's metaphor, in which one unintentionally gives someone else a disease which kills them,

18:07.240 --> 18:09.240
with a hug, of all things,

18:09.240 --> 18:11.480
is not really the most apt here.

18:11.480 --> 18:16.120
A better metaphor would be one person imprisoning and starving another person

18:16.120 --> 18:19.560
until they're so weak their body can no longer fight off disease.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.520
And should that person then die of a disease,

18:23.160 --> 18:26.120
how responsible would we say the imprisonment is?

18:26.120 --> 18:31.240
Now, to be fair here, my metaphor there involves one person breaking the law.

18:31.880 --> 18:36.280
And Stefan has claimed that whatever violent acts were committed against the Native Americans,

18:36.280 --> 18:38.120
such as burning their food stores,

18:38.120 --> 18:42.520
were justified by the laws of war that were accepted at the time.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.520
So if that were true, my metaphor would also be a bad one.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.840
So is Stefan right there?

18:48.840 --> 18:52.200
We're now going to take a look at the sections of his video where he discusses

18:52.200 --> 18:56.680
and attempts to justify the intentional violence inflicted upon the Native Americans.

18:57.320 --> 19:00.840
Is it true that it was always justified by warfare?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.040
Well, let's see.

19:02.040 --> 19:06.520
And, of course, there are many different massacres and atrocities I could point to

19:06.520 --> 19:10.200
and tell you about here where white people slaughtered defenseless,

19:10.200 --> 19:12.840
peaceful Native people and destroyed their homes.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.600
But I'll just do one.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.840
The one I mentioned earlier.

19:16.840 --> 19:21.160
Let's talk about the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.560
So way back in 1851, 13 years before the massacre,

19:25.560 --> 19:31.480
the United States and several Native American tribes signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie,

19:31.480 --> 19:35.720
in which the United States recognized large amounts of land as Native territory,

19:35.720 --> 19:38.040
which they held no claim over.

19:38.040 --> 19:43.080
This included parts of modern-day Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas.

19:43.080 --> 19:47.000
So not exactly an insignificant amount of land there.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.280
However, seven years later, in 1858,

19:50.280 --> 19:55.800
gold was discovered in Colorado, triggering the Pike's Peak Gold Rush.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.080
And that meant that a large amount of European American settlers

19:59.080 --> 20:05.080
started violating the treaty and illegally moving into and settling on Native land.

20:05.080 --> 20:09.080
Stefan at one point mentions a similar series of events in California,

20:09.080 --> 20:14.120
stating the discovery of gold in California exacerbated tensions.

20:14.680 --> 20:21.400
Now, what exacerbated tensions means is trigger the genocide of the Native population

20:21.400 --> 20:24.760
in what's known to history as the California genocide.

20:24.760 --> 20:28.760
And even by the most conservative possible definition of the word genocide,

20:28.760 --> 20:32.600
what happened in California undoubtedly qualifies.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.680
Militia groups waged a war of extermination against the Native people,

20:36.680 --> 20:40.040
often with implicit, and sometimes even explicit,

20:40.040 --> 20:42.600
support from both the state and federal governments.

20:43.240 --> 20:49.480
In 1851, California governor John McDougall announced his intent to make war upon the Indians,

20:49.480 --> 20:55.000
which must, of necessity, be one of extermination to many of the tribes.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.560
And if that's not outright genocidal intent,

20:58.120 --> 20:59.320
I don't know what is.

20:59.320 --> 21:02.360
So that's your exacerbated tensions there.

21:02.360 --> 21:06.920
What a wonderfully cowardly revisionist fig leaf that phrase is.

21:06.920 --> 21:12.120
Tom broke into Bill's house, murdered his family, and stole all of his possessions.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.320
And that really exacerbated tensions between the two.

21:15.960 --> 21:16.840
Anyway.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.360
So back to the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1858.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.960
After the discovery of gold in Colorado, there was a flood of European American settlers

21:25.960 --> 21:31.640
illegally crossing into Native lands and exacerbating tensions all over the place.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.480
Now, in an attempt to keep the peace,

21:33.480 --> 21:38.040
a designation of chiefs from both the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes

21:38.040 --> 21:41.720
signed the Treaty of Fort Wise, ceding to the United States

21:41.720 --> 21:44.600
most of the lands they currently held claim to.

21:44.600 --> 21:49.080
This new territory was less than one-thirteenth the size of the land claimed by them

21:49.080 --> 21:51.960
in the Treaty of Fort Laramie a decade earlier.

21:51.960 --> 21:56.840
So they forked over the vast majority of their lands in order to keep the peace with the states.

21:57.640 --> 22:01.080
Among the Cheyenne chiefs who signed the treaty were Black Kettle,

22:01.080 --> 22:03.720
White Antelope, and Lean Bear.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.280
And they're important, so remember those names.

22:06.280 --> 22:10.040
Sorry, I realize there's a lot of dry history recitation in this section,

22:10.040 --> 22:13.000
but I promise it's all important for fully realizing

22:13.000 --> 22:16.920
just how incredibly fucked the Sand Creek Massacre was.

22:16.920 --> 22:21.320
So three years later, 1864, the year of the massacre,

22:21.320 --> 22:25.800
Colorado troops under the command of US Army Colonel John Chivington

22:25.800 --> 22:31.560
began, without any declaration of war, mind, or real reason, apparently,

22:31.560 --> 22:34.360
attacking and destroying Cheyenne camps.

22:34.360 --> 22:38.680
And on May 16th, 1864, a detachment of these soldiers

22:38.680 --> 22:42.600
encountered a group of Native Americans in a buffalo hunting camp.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.720
This group included Black Kettle and Lean Bear,

22:45.720 --> 22:51.000
two of the chiefs who had three years ago signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States.

22:51.080 --> 22:56.440
Lean Bear rode out to meet the soldiers, fully confident of a peaceful encounter.

22:56.440 --> 23:00.840
You see, Lean Bear had previously met with President Lincoln in the White House

23:00.840 --> 23:04.040
and carried with him documents signed by Lincoln

23:04.040 --> 23:07.480
explaining he was a friend of the United States and was peaceful.

23:08.280 --> 23:12.200
As he approached the soldiers, they opened fire and murdered him.

23:12.200 --> 23:16.440
They were acting on orders from Chivington to kill every Cheyenne they encountered.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.880
And to quote the man himself,

23:18.760 --> 23:22.680
I have come to kill Indians and believe it's right and honorable

23:22.680 --> 23:26.600
to use any means under God's heaven to kill Indians.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.840
Kill and scalp all, big and little, knits make lice.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.160
Pleasant chap there.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.480
Anyway, tensions now very exacerbated.

23:37.480 --> 23:42.360
The governor of Colorado, John Evans, sent a letter to the various local tribes

23:42.360 --> 23:46.200
inviting all who desired peace to report to Fort Lyon

23:46.200 --> 23:48.520
where they would be recognized as peaceful

23:48.520 --> 23:51.960
and placed under the protection of the United States government.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.080
Black Kettle then led a group of his people to Fort Lyon

23:55.080 --> 23:58.120
where they were directed to settle at Sand Creek.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.000
In the center of the camp, over his lodge,

24:01.000 --> 24:05.240
Black Kettle flew an American flag with a white flag tied beneath it

24:05.240 --> 24:09.720
to signal they were peaceful and under the protection of the United States.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.320
The majority of people present at the camp were women and children

24:13.320 --> 24:16.120
as most of the warriors were away hunting.

24:16.200 --> 24:19.480
So let's just recap how these people got here.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.520
Two times they had signed treaties with the United States

24:22.520 --> 24:27.160
and two times people from the United States had violated those treaties,

24:27.160 --> 24:30.200
invaded their lands, and killed their people.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.320
The natives had signed away most of their remaining lands

24:33.320 --> 24:36.280
attempting to keep the peace with the United States.

24:36.280 --> 24:39.720
Lean Bear, one of their chiefs, was murdered in cold blood

24:39.720 --> 24:42.120
attempting to keep peace with the United States.

24:42.120 --> 24:46.920
And now finally they had surrendered themselves to the mercy of the United States,

24:46.920 --> 24:48.440
settled where they were told to,

24:48.440 --> 24:51.320
and were fully under the impression that they were at peace

24:51.320 --> 24:54.280
and had been guaranteed protection and safety.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.360
Now, uh, content warning for this next bit.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.920
I'm about to read some pretty nasty stuff.

25:00.920 --> 25:05.560
If you're bothered by descriptions of violence, I'd skip ahead a little ways.

25:05.560 --> 25:09.320
So okay, on November 29th, 1864,

25:09.320 --> 25:14.760
Colonel Chivington had a detachment of his men surround the camp at Sand Creek with guns

25:14.760 --> 25:16.760
and ordered them to open fire.

25:16.760 --> 25:21.560
The women and children in the camp gathered around the American flag above Black Kettle's Lodge.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.160
White Antelope, one of the chiefs I mentioned earlier,

25:25.160 --> 25:27.320
was shot down as he approached the troops,

25:27.320 --> 25:29.480
shouting for them to stop firing.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.400
His body was later mutilated,

25:31.400 --> 25:35.720
he was scalped and had his nose, ears, and genitals cut off.

25:35.720 --> 25:39.240
The soldiers then moved into the camp with rifles and sabers

25:39.240 --> 25:41.560
and massacred everyone they could.

25:41.560 --> 25:44.440
Witness accounts speak of scalped children,

25:44.440 --> 25:46.680
children with their brains knocked out,

25:46.680 --> 25:48.520
pregnant women being cut open,

25:49.080 --> 25:52.200
children being used as target practice by the soldiers,

25:52.840 --> 25:54.760
mutilated corpses,

25:54.760 --> 25:57.080
all manner of dreadful things like that.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.520
More than 100 people were murdered at Sand Creek,

26:00.520 --> 26:02.680
the majority women and children,

26:02.680 --> 26:04.120
and all of them peaceful.

26:04.120 --> 26:07.400
Black Kettle, the chief, managed to escape the camp

26:07.400 --> 26:11.400
and somehow remained dedicated to achieving a lasting peace

26:11.400 --> 26:14.680
right up until 1868 when he was shot in the back

26:14.680 --> 26:18.520
and killed by US Army soldiers when he was crossing a river.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.800
Chivington, the colonel who orchestrated the massacre,

26:21.800 --> 26:24.120
never faced criminal charges.

26:24.120 --> 26:27.480
So what does this guy have to say about Sand Creek,

26:27.480 --> 26:32.360
or indeed any massacre or atrocity carried out against the Native Americans?

26:32.440 --> 26:35.000
Well, absolutely nothing.

26:35.560 --> 26:39.800
Stefan deals with the issue by just not mentioning it at all,

26:39.800 --> 26:45.320
besides one passing reference to there being examples of cruelty on both sides.

26:45.960 --> 26:50.840
There's no mention of Wounded Knee or Sand Creek or any other atrocity.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.400
In fact, actually in a video entitled

26:53.400 --> 26:55.960
The Truth About the Native American Genocide,

26:55.960 --> 26:59.960
Stefan never once names or quotes a Native American person.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.120
Does that seem odd to you?

27:02.120 --> 27:03.640
Because it should.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.600
How can a video profess to tell the truth about history

27:06.600 --> 27:09.960
while completely ignoring one side of the history?

27:09.960 --> 27:13.080
Stefan only talks about white violence against the Natives

27:13.080 --> 27:15.560
when he thinks he can justify it.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.200
And let's have a listen to him attempt to do that.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.160
Now say what you like.

27:21.160 --> 27:24.600
These actions were almost certainly in conformity with the laws of the war

27:24.600 --> 27:27.800
that were accepted at the time.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.320
The villagers of warring Natives who refused to surrender

27:31.320 --> 27:35.560
were viewed as legitimate military targets and could be acted against,

27:35.560 --> 27:38.120
and this of course occurred significantly later

27:38.120 --> 27:41.080
when Churchill bombed the Germans and so on.

27:41.080 --> 27:44.440
So like it or not, those are part of the rules of war at the time

27:44.440 --> 27:45.800
and considerably thereafter.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.040
So Stefan's argument is weak here, of course,

27:50.040 --> 27:53.880
because there is no good argument in defense of what he's trying to defend.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.640
He compares the destruction of Native American food stores

27:57.640 --> 28:01.880
and villages to the Allied bombing of German cities in World War II,

28:01.880 --> 28:03.880
which is a bit silly for several reasons.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.400
Firstly, that Allied bombing of German cities

28:07.400 --> 28:09.640
is actually a rather contentious issue.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.560
But regardless of that, whatever your opinion of Churchill

28:13.560 --> 28:15.560
or the actions of the Allied forces,

28:15.560 --> 28:19.320
they were at the very least fighting against an expansionist,

28:19.320 --> 28:22.280
genocidal fascist state that would have invaded

28:22.280 --> 28:25.240
and conquered their countries if it had the opportunity.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.360
The white people in America were fighting against

28:28.360 --> 28:31.880
some Native people whose land they wanted to steal.

28:31.880 --> 28:36.360
And Stefan's metaphor further casts the Native Americans as the Nazis,

28:36.360 --> 28:38.920
which, you know, piss off.

28:38.920 --> 28:42.360
The other way Stefan's argument is weak here is that throughout this section,

28:42.360 --> 28:47.080
he mentions several instances of Native violence against white people.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.960
And he's saying, this is what was normal at the time.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.280
You can't blame anyone in particular for that.

28:52.280 --> 28:55.480
It wasn't just the white people doing the violence.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.560
Mom, mom, they did it too.

28:58.200 --> 29:02.520
You know, it's a childish argument of moral equivalence there.

29:02.520 --> 29:05.400
And I thought it was the leftist Marxist professor types

29:05.400 --> 29:07.880
who went in for all that stuff, not you, Stefan.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.640
Anyway, attempting to equate the violence of the Natives

29:11.640 --> 29:15.640
with the violence of the European Americans is wrong for a few reasons.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.000
Mainly, obviously, the scale.

29:19.480 --> 29:23.720
The whites had cannons and rifles and organized military.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.240
They had a much greater ability to inflict violence.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.800
But even if we ignore that material inequality

29:29.800 --> 29:31.960
and we give Native people all the same equipment

29:31.960 --> 29:35.080
and assume an equal number of people killed on each side,

29:35.080 --> 29:38.680
one side was still fighting to defend their lands from invasion

29:38.680 --> 29:41.880
and the other side was the one doing the invading.

29:41.880 --> 29:46.440
The Native people always come out morally superior if that's how we're measuring it.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.760
The other odd thing about Stefan's argument here

29:48.760 --> 29:54.760
is that he, in his introduction, mentions the superiority of white Western civilization.

29:54.760 --> 29:58.040
That is, of course, what he's trying to preserve and defend,

29:58.040 --> 30:01.720
the idea that white Western European people are superior.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.520
Though I'm sure he wouldn't put it quite that bluntly.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.360
This moral equivalence argument from later in his video

30:08.360 --> 30:11.400
is completely at odds with that idea, however.

30:11.400 --> 30:16.040
If you're trying to argue Western Europeans are supposedly a superior people,

30:16.600 --> 30:18.520
then that's what you have to prove.

30:18.600 --> 30:22.280
Moral superiority, not moral equivalence,

30:22.280 --> 30:26.920
but they did it too, isn't a good enough argument, Stefan.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.400
Anyway, we're getting pretty close to wrapping up now,

30:29.400 --> 30:32.680
but before we do, I'd like to touch on a few more aspects

30:32.680 --> 30:36.360
of the genocide debate that Stefan doesn't mention in his video.

30:36.360 --> 30:40.840
And they relate to the following section of the UN's legal definition of genocide.

30:40.840 --> 30:41.480
And I quote,

30:42.120 --> 30:46.040
"...imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,

30:46.040 --> 30:49.800
and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

30:49.800 --> 30:53.080
Both these things can be classified as genocide."

30:53.080 --> 30:57.880
So first up, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.

30:57.880 --> 31:02.600
So, in the 1960s and 70s, the United States Indian Health Service

31:02.600 --> 31:05.720
sterilized thousands of Native American women,

31:05.720 --> 31:10.040
often without their consent, and sometimes without even their knowledge.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.760
And well, that's all I have to say about that, really.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.960
It so perfectly fits the exact legal definition there

31:17.960 --> 31:20.360
that I don't really need to elaborate, I don't think.

31:21.080 --> 31:25.720
Yes, that really happened, and no, Stefan doesn't mention it.

31:25.720 --> 31:30.440
Next up is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.800
Well, I won't dwell on this,

31:31.800 --> 31:36.440
but let's briefly talk about the Canadian-Indian residential school system.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.240
So this was a system of boarding schools

31:39.240 --> 31:42.360
that indigenous children were required to attend.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.520
The purpose of these schools was to, quote,

31:45.080 --> 31:47.640
"...kill the Indian to save the man."

31:48.600 --> 31:52.280
A quote from a chap called Richard Henry Pratt there,

31:52.280 --> 31:54.840
who founded the first such boarding school.

31:54.840 --> 31:59.240
And these schools were notoriously harsh and brutal places to be.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.960
They were located far from reservations,

32:01.960 --> 32:05.640
so that the children would have little contact with their families or culture,

32:05.640 --> 32:10.280
and thus separated, the children were forced to speak another language,

32:10.280 --> 32:13.480
and the practice of native cultural activities was banned,

32:13.480 --> 32:16.920
with corporal punishment being used to enforce these rules.

32:16.920 --> 32:21.320
These schools, the purpose of which was obviously to eradicate native culture

32:21.320 --> 32:23.160
and replace it with the dominant culture,

32:23.160 --> 32:25.720
were operated into the 1980s.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.600
And several apologies have since been issued

32:28.600 --> 32:30.920
by the Canadian government on the matter.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.120
So, there we go.

32:32.120 --> 32:35.640
Two examples there of acts that can be called genocidal,

32:35.640 --> 32:39.240
continuing into very recent times, only a few decades ago.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.040
Stefan doesn't consider these factors.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.480
Perhaps they don't meet his definition of genocide,

32:45.480 --> 32:47.720
but it's worthwhile asking here,

32:47.720 --> 32:52.200
what is Stefan's definition of genocide as presented in this video?

32:52.200 --> 32:55.720
He seems to think that the only acceptable definition of genocide

32:55.720 --> 33:00.280
is the total unanimous and unceasing attempt of one people

33:00.280 --> 33:01.720
to wipe out another people.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.160
And is that a reasonable definition?

33:05.160 --> 33:07.560
I'll leave that up to you to decide.

33:07.640 --> 33:12.120
So, we're back to arguing definitions of genocide again.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.520
And I suppose much of the debate depends upon

33:14.520 --> 33:18.680
whether you believe genocide describes the intent or the result.

33:18.680 --> 33:23.480
Of course, for the most part, the United States wanted territorial expansion,

33:23.480 --> 33:26.440
and it was willing to use genocide as both a threat

33:26.440 --> 33:29.000
and a practical weapon to achieve that goal.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.120
Stefan at one point mentions Thomas Jefferson's attempts

33:32.120 --> 33:34.600
to inoculate natives against disease,

33:34.600 --> 33:37.400
but even Jefferson, in other circumstances,

33:37.400 --> 33:40.040
was willing to threaten native people with genocide.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.200
In 1807, he wrote,

33:56.760 --> 33:59.480
So, genocide was clearly on the table then,

33:59.480 --> 34:01.000
at least as a threat.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.280
And it's genocide as a means rather than an end,

34:04.280 --> 34:06.520
but is that still genocide?

34:06.520 --> 34:08.600
Well, personally, I've seen it argued that

34:08.600 --> 34:12.280
ethnic cleansing is a more generally appropriate term here,

34:12.280 --> 34:14.920
though I'd still argue that the history is peppered with,

34:14.920 --> 34:19.800
at the very least, genocidal moments, genocidal incidents,

34:19.800 --> 34:24.120
even if genocide wasn't continuous and unceasing government policy

34:24.120 --> 34:25.800
throughout the whole period.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.200
But regardless of how we classify it,

34:28.200 --> 34:30.760
and this is going all the way back to the start of the video here,

34:31.320 --> 34:33.720
Regardless of how we classify the actions

34:33.720 --> 34:36.200
of the invading European Americans,

34:36.200 --> 34:39.560
how they treated the Native Americans was, for the most part,

34:39.560 --> 34:42.680
completely unjustified, morally wrong,

34:42.680 --> 34:45.640
and only defensible if you, as Stefan does,

34:45.640 --> 34:48.920
completely ignore the majority of the actual history.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.440
I'd like to end today with a brief note about white guilt.

34:52.440 --> 34:55.160
That being what Stefan says is behind the attempts

34:55.160 --> 34:58.840
to distort the true history in which white people were always great.

34:59.720 --> 35:02.120
Lawrence Southern has also used this excuse

35:02.120 --> 35:04.840
to explain some of the horrible stuff she believes.

35:04.840 --> 35:08.840
White people hate themselves and are so guilty about the sins of the past

35:08.840 --> 35:12.360
that they're ignoring reality and deluding themselves in the present.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.400
And, well, it's not true.

35:15.400 --> 35:18.680
Now, I'm not saying white guilt is impossible as a concept,

35:18.680 --> 35:22.920
just that people like Stefan and Lawrence Southern aren't applying it correctly.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.880
Reading the history of what happened to the Native Americans,

35:25.880 --> 35:29.640
I was often outraged, sometimes disgusted,

35:29.640 --> 35:32.280
but I never felt personally guilty,

35:32.280 --> 35:35.400
just saddened by what people can do to one another.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.720
Acknowledging offense from the past

35:37.720 --> 35:40.840
in which white people have been in the wrong isn't driven by guilt,

35:41.400 --> 35:42.440
just honesty.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.320
Understanding is not guilt.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.120
Hiding from the historical record,

35:48.760 --> 35:50.360
cherry-picking from it,

35:50.360 --> 35:53.400
whitewashing it to erase atrocities committed,

35:53.400 --> 35:56.680
well, that's real guilt in action right there.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.040
Thanks for watching, everyone.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.400
Like, subscribe, leave a comment,

36:01.400 --> 36:05.720
and basically just have a grand old time interacting with YouTube right there.

36:06.520 --> 36:10.600
Thanks especially, as always, to my supporters on Patreon,

36:10.600 --> 36:13.400
who enable me to keep making videos like this.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.320
We're closing in on our next goal, which is scary,

36:17.320 --> 36:20.360
so head over there and check it out, if you feel like.

36:20.360 --> 36:25.080
I'm also thinking of doing another Q&A video for 25k subscribers,

36:25.080 --> 36:26.920
which should be coming up fairly soon.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.800
So if you want to ask a question,

36:29.800 --> 36:31.480
send it me over on Curious Cat,

36:31.480 --> 36:34.600
and make sure to sign a name at the bottom if you want a name read out,

36:34.600 --> 36:37.960
and put for your Q&A video at the top or something,

36:38.520 --> 36:40.680
so I know it's not just a regular question.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.280
Okay, folks, thanks a lot, and I'll see you next time.
