0	4680	Hello everyone. Today we're going to be talking about a Stefan Molyneux video,
4680	7600	the truth about the Native American genocide,
7600	14120	which is just one in a series of videos that covers history, pop culture, public figures, you name it.
14120	19000	And let's start off by watching just a short clip from the introduction to this particular video.
19000	21800	Hi everybody, this is Stefan Molyneux from Free Domain Radio.
21800	27720	I hope you're doing well, and I hope you're as sick and tired as I am of being lied to
27760	33440	about everything, all the time, your history is lied about in order to control your future.
33440	39200	I'm sick and tired of it, and I'm going to help you break out of the matrix of Marxist delusions
39200	42720	that have birthed our self-destructive modern culture. So...
43440	45120	So, quite an intro there.
45120	49080	And this is what I find interesting about Stefan's The Truth About series.
49080	55120	He openly starts off with the assumption that the established and accepted history is a lie.
55160	57480	The description to his video reads,
57480	62040	"...interactions between the early European settlers and America's native population
62040	67160	are often described using terms such as slaughter, genocide, and holocaust."
67160	70680	But what is the truth about the Native American genocide?
70680	73720	With the implication being that apparently terms like slaughter,
73720	77320	genocide, and holocaust could not possibly be the truth.
77320	81720	You see, for Stefan, there was the actual true historical event,
81800	88760	and then that truth was perverted and warped by liberal, leftist, white-guilt, Marxist professor types
88760	91960	in order to control society, or whatever it is they do.
91960	97800	And then after that comes Stefan, who's going to see through their lies and their ideology,
97800	102200	re-establish the truth, and thereby save the world, or something.
102200	105720	Now, just to lay all my cards on the table at the start here,
105720	109880	I don't agree with Stefan there, you might be surprised to hear.
110120	113240	For me, it goes, there was an actual historical event,
113240	118840	let's say the violence against the various Native American peoples by white people invading their lands.
119720	123080	Then there were proposed justifications for that behavior
123080	127320	in an attempt to absolve the white folk of any guilt in the situation.
127320	130440	Then after that came the book-learning professor types,
130440	135160	who, through historical research and actually, you know, interviewing Native American people
135160	139480	and asking them about it, uncovered the truth of the situation.
140200	145000	For white people, of course, the Native people already knew the truth of the situation.
145000	148920	Then comes Stefan, who is fed up not with being lied to,
148920	153240	but that the truth is now being told, because it's a truth he doesn't want to hear.
153800	157720	So he dismisses the modern historical consensus as a lie,
157720	164040	and tries to get us back to this point when white people were good and absolved of any wrongdoing ever.
164040	165640	And wouldn't that be nice?
165640	168200	So which of us is correct there?
168200	171320	Well, to find out, we're gonna take a look at Stefan's video.
171320	177240	That the established history is a lie is a pretty big claim and would require a lot of proof.
177240	180360	So we're gonna see what Stefan has to offer on that front.
180360	183960	And as always, except for the times when I forget to say this,
183960	188920	I recommend that you also watch his video so that you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting it.
188920	191480	I'll put a link in the description below.
191480	194680	So, okay, welcome back, uh, quotes.
194920	198600	And let's start off by giving a brief overview of Stefan's video.
199160	201640	Firstly, in the section titled Estimates,
201640	205800	Stefan lays out his best guess for the native population decline in numbers.
206360	208520	Then in the section titled Declines,
208520	213160	he argues that since there are more native people alive today than at his lowest estimate,
213160	217480	around 1880, that a genocide could therefore not have occurred.
217480	221800	Next, in the sections titled Disease, Empty and Effects of Disease,
221800	224120	he makes the case that a genocide could not have occurred
224120	229560	because the majority of Native American deaths were attributable to disease and starvation.
229560	232680	Then in the sections titled Warfare and Alliances,
232680	235960	he lists some native violence against the white population
235960	238760	and makes the case that any white violence was justified
238760	241480	by the fact they were at war with the natives.
241480	245800	So a genocide could not have occurred because the actions of any white people were, quote,
246360	250840	"...in conformity with the laws of war that were accepted at the time."
250840	254680	Now, you may have noticed there that Stefan's video is primarily concerned
254680	259800	with whether or not what happens to the Native Americans can technically be called genocide.
259800	262440	And there is much academic debate on that subject,
262440	267640	most of it boiling down to what particular definition of genocide one happens to be using.
267640	271160	Now, personally, I think it's something of a goalpost shift.
271160	274200	Stefan is hiding from the actual interesting question,
274200	278840	which is, was what happened to the Native Americans right or wrong,
278840	281800	by instead having the dictionary definition argument,
281800	285480	as if by potentially proving that what happened to the Native Americans
285480	288040	could not technically be called genocide,
288040	290440	it was therefore somehow justifiable.
290440	296520	Now, there's obviously a lot of moral ground between justifiable action and outright genocide,
296520	300200	of course, but Stefan's video is about the genocide question,
300200	303720	so that's what we're going to be attempting to answer too.
303720	307960	So then, was what happened to the Native Americans a genocide?
308040	311960	And there are three main points Stefan makes when answering this question.
311960	316360	He says no genocide could have occurred because not all Native people were killed,
317080	320360	most deaths were due to disease or starvation,
320360	325160	and white violence against the Natives was justified by the rules of warfare.
325160	328280	And we're going to go through these one by one in more detail.
328280	332200	But first off, we're going to read the legal definition of genocide from the UN,
332200	334520	so we know exactly what we're looking for.
334520	338440	Genocide is defined in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment
338440	341400	of the Crime of Genocide, 1948, as,
341400	342200	quote,
342200	346440	"...any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part,
346440	350440	a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such,
350440	355720	killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group,
355720	359000	deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated
359000	361800	to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part,
362520	365640	imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,
366200	369640	and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."
369640	372200	So commit all that to memory, folks.
372760	375880	And okay, with that very lengthy introduction out of the way,
375880	378440	let's get to Stefan's arguments.
378440	382680	Firstly, the fact that not all Native people were killed.
383320	386440	Now in 2014, those who directly self-report as Native Americans
386440	389320	numbered just under three million people.
389320	396520	So, over a few hundred years, the European control of North America has increased
396520	399720	Native American genetic expression enormously.
399720	402440	Diluted, no question, but it has increased.
402440	407960	That is not technically, or even allegorically, genocide in any way.
407960	412280	Genocide is when the gene pool gets wiped out, not when it flourishes.
412280	415720	So here, Stefan is making the case that there are about three million
415720	418520	self-identified Native Americans in the US today,
418520	424680	as well as a varying amount of Natives contained within other racial populations,
424680	426040	whatever that's supposed to mean.
426680	429240	And he declares that a genocide could not have happened,
429240	432520	otherwise neither of these things would be the case.
432520	434680	And there's a few problems with that argument.
434680	438920	The first is that just because there are still Native Americans around today
438920	442840	doesn't necessarily mean a genocide could not have happened in the past.
442840	445480	The legal definition of genocide accounts for acts
445480	450040	committed with intent to destroy a people in whole or in part.
450680	453080	Not every single Native American person
453080	456360	would have to have been killed for it to count as a genocide.
456360	458920	As a comparison, in the year 1900,
458920	463800	there were around an estimated 11 million Jewish people living in the world.
463800	466520	Today, there are more than 14 million.
466520	471160	The number of Jewish people alive has increased over the last hundred years.
471800	474280	Does that mean that there could not have been a genocide
474280	477880	committed against Jewish people sometime in between those two dates?
477880	481000	Are we therefore to conclude the Holocaust could not have happened
481000	484040	simply because it did not kill every single Jewish person?
484600	486600	Of course not, that's ridiculous.
486600	491000	And Stefan is talking about a history that is several centuries long.
491000	495800	You can't just look at the starting population number and the ending population number
495800	500680	and conclude entirely from that that no genocide happened between those two times.
500680	505320	The next problem here is that Stefan is only considering race and genetics.
505320	508440	The legal definition of genocide also accounts for
508440	512440	attempts to destroy national, ethnical, and religious groups.
513080	514840	An important thing to remember here
514840	518120	is that Native Americans were not a single monolithic group.
518120	520440	There were many, many different groups of people
520440	523880	living under the umbrella term Native American.
523880	527320	An attempt to destroy any particular one of these groups
527320	530120	could be classified as genocidal in and of itself
530120	535160	without necessarily having to include wiping out everyone else of that racial group.
535160	539560	The Sand Creek Massacre in 1864, which we'll talk about later,
539560	544280	just to pick one example, was undoubtedly a singular genocidal act
544280	547800	even though the aim was only to kill the Native Americans present
547800	550680	rather than all Native Americans everywhere.
550680	554440	So I'm forced to conclude that these numbers are, to quote Stefan,
554440	558280	not an argument since with regards to our genocide question
558280	562120	it doesn't matter how many Native Americans still wear before colonization
562120	565000	or how many Native American people there are today.
565000	567720	Those numbers by themselves cannot tell us anything
567720	570440	about whether a genocide was committed in the interim.
570440	573800	Anyway, let's move on and talk about disease and starvation
573800	576280	and we'll tackle the most contentious issue first
576280	578920	which is the alleged use of smallpox blankets
578920	581560	to deliberately infect the Native population.
582920	585480	So deliberate infection from smallpox blankets.
585560	589320	Well, these are based entirely on two letters from British soldiers in 1763.
589320	591720	Not a government program, not a government policy,
591720	593880	no evidence that it was actually done.
593880	598120	Now, in 1763, this is long after smallpox had actually peaked
598120	600280	and there's no evidence of a significant outbreak
600280	603720	as a result of this vaguely theoretical bioweapon.
603720	607640	So first off here, where Stefan says the stories of deliberate infection
607640	612040	are based entirely on two letters from British soldiers in 1763.
612840	614760	That's a lie, unfortunately.
615240	619000	We do have a series of letters sent between General Geoffrey Amherst
619000	622760	and one of his colonels discussing a plan to deliberately spread smallpox
622760	627640	with infected blankets during the Siege of Fort Pitt in 1763.
628200	630040	During which Amherst states,
630040	633960	you will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets
633960	638920	as well as try every other method that can serve to extirpate this excreble race.
639880	642440	Extirpate meaning to exterminate there.
642440	645160	So there's no doubt what their intent was here.
645160	647800	Now, Stefan claims the stories of deliberate infection
647800	649800	stem entirely from these letters,
649800	652680	with there being no evidence such a thing was actually done.
653400	656600	However, over here in... reality,
656600	661080	we also have the journal of merchant and militia commander, William Trent,
661080	665800	who was at Fort Pitt and he writes of a parlay with the besieging native people.
665800	669320	Out of our regard to them, them being the natives there,
669320	673960	we gave them two blankets and a handkerchief out of the smallpox hospital.
673960	676600	I hope it will have the desired effect.
676600	680840	And we even have the army invoice for the blankets and handkerchief,
680840	686760	quote, taken from the people in the hospital to convey the smallpox to the Indians.
686760	691960	Now, either everyone in Fort Pitt decided to play a bit of a practical joke on later historians,
691960	696920	or, actually, their letters and records describe them doing a thing that they actually did.
697560	701800	And Stefan is elsewhere happy to accept letters from the time as being truthful.
701800	704280	In the section of his video titled Empty,
704280	708120	he quotes something a John Winthrop wrote without once noting that,
708120	712920	of course, this is just one letter, it's not necessarily truthful, etc.,
712920	717000	because that letter was saying something he thinks bolsters his argument.
717000	719720	When the letters say something he doesn't like, though,
719720	722760	oh, well, they're just letters, not actual evidence.
722760	729080	And one wonders what actual evidence Stefan is waiting for, really, from Fort Pitt in 1763.
729880	732920	Video footage, perhaps? Who knows.
732920	737320	Now, the effects of the deliberate infection attempt at Fort Pitt are, of course,
737320	739240	impossible to ascertain.
739240	744280	Any outbreak of smallpox after the blanket incident could have been unconnected to it.
744280	747720	Also impossible to ascertain is the frequency of this tactic,
747720	752040	though I'd personally say that the fact multiple people all spoke about the plan
752040	755080	without commenting on its unusualness or immorality
755080	758520	suggests it was a tactic that was at least known about beforehand,
758520	761640	even if it wasn't necessarily widely practiced.
762280	764840	However, with regards to our genocide question,
764840	768840	the efficacy of the blanket tactic doesn't actually matter.
768840	771160	The legal definition of genocide states,
771160	774840	any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy.
775640	776200	Intent.
777000	780520	They intentionally tried to spread disease in order to,
780520	784360	as General Amherst openly stated, exterminate a race.
784920	786920	It doesn't matter how well it worked.
786920	790680	You know, they don't get let off the hook for being bad at genocide.
790680	792840	What matters is that they tried to do it.
793400	797960	Let's move on and discuss the unintentional deaths by disease and its effects.
798680	800200	If you are infected with a disease,
800760	802760	you don't even know it, no one tells you about it,
802760	805960	there's no symptoms, nobody knows what's going on,
805960	807720	and you go and hug some family member,
808600	813800	and unknowingly, unwittingly infect that family member with your disease,
813800	816520	we would consider that a terrible tragedy.
816520	818040	We would not charge you with murder.
818040	820600	Come on, I mean, this is not that morally complicated.
821800	824120	Not that morally complicated, eh?
825080	826440	Well, we'll see about that.
827400	830200	Stefan's little analogy there is pretty telling.
830200	834520	Throughout the sections of his video entitled Disease, Empty and Effects of Disease,
834600	838680	he repeatedly stresses the completely innocent and unintentional way
838680	843160	in which Native Americans contracted and died from various diseases.
843160	845560	After all, we can hardly blame the white settlers
845560	849240	for the diseases they passed on unintentionally, can we?
850040	852440	Things aren't that simple, unfortunately.
852440	857480	There's several factors that Stefan fails to either notice or mention here.
857480	862760	He treats every death from disease or its effects as a completely blameless accident.
863320	868360	And to examine this, we'll again use a comparison to the genocide carried out by Nazi Germany.
868360	873160	Many of the deaths in German concentration camps during the Second World War were due to disease,
873720	876360	and many of these could also be called unintentional.
876360	879880	In one sense, it wasn't as if the Nazis were deliberately infecting
879880	883240	each and every individual prisoner who died of disease.
883880	889240	Rather, the terrible conditions under which the Nazis forced their prisoners to exist
889240	892120	facilitated the easy spread of disease.
892200	898440	Malnourishment, close confinement, overwork, stress, denial of proper healthcare,
899000	901880	all these things can help disease to spread.
901880	905320	Now, the Nazis are, of course, still at fault for those deaths,
905320	909000	even though it was technically the disease and not them that did the killing.
909640	913720	My point here being that, of course, not all disease deaths are blameless,
913720	917480	even if the disease itself wasn't intentionally passed on.
917480	921640	So how applicable is this comparison to the treatment of Native Americans?
922120	926520	Could the actions of the white invaders have contributed to the spread of disease,
926520	928360	even unintentionally?
928360	932040	And to start to answer this, let's watch two little clips of Stefan here.
932040	935160	First up, from his section titled Effects of Disease.
936520	939480	And it wasn't just the direct effects of the disease, right?
939480	943240	So often, so many adult natives were incapacitated by disease
943240	946760	that the others, like the pregnant women, the children who relied on their food gathering,
946760	948200	died from starvation.
948200	952760	Sometimes, as many died from hunger as died from disease.
952760	954200	So Stefan is right there.
954200	957160	Often, it wasn't the disease that killed directly,
957160	961800	it just made it harder to hunt or gather food, which then led to starvation.
961800	964520	And this relationship also goes the other way.
964520	968520	Malnourished bodies are less likely to fight off disease and infection,
968520	972280	and therefore lack of food facilitated the spread of disease.
972280	976440	And now let's watch the second clip from his segment entitled Alliances.
977320	981560	Now, whites who were unable to beat the natives on the plains
981560	984120	would wait till they went to ground for the winter,
984120	988760	and then would destroy the food stores during the winter.
988760	991960	And this was, in fact, the impetus for the initial reservation system.
992600	995640	Whites destroyed native food stores during winter.
996200	999960	Now, I trust most of you will have got the point already right now,
999960	1005000	but just to make it clear, actions of the white European Americans,
1005000	1009240	such as burning the natives' food stores, helped disease to spread.
1009800	1014680	And as such, we can't designate all the deaths from disease or starvation as blameless,
1014680	1019720	as many of them may not have happened if it were not for the additional actions of the white people.
1019720	1022760	Now, destruction of material resources is one such action
1022760	1024360	that would encourage the spread of disease,
1024360	1028200	but others include the forced removal of native people from their lands.
1028760	1031880	For example, many of the deaths associated with the Trail of Tears
1031880	1033560	were due to disease or starvation.
1034200	1037480	The rounding up of native people into internment camps and so on,
1037480	1040280	these actions all helped disease to spread.
1040280	1043800	And I'd again like to make something clear here that Stefan doesn't mention,
1043800	1045560	whether deliberately or not.
1046200	1048680	The period of time he's talking about,
1048680	1053400	from when the first Europeans encountered native American people to the present day,
1053400	1055080	is several centuries long.
1055960	1059640	Not all disease deaths occurred at the initial moment of contact,
1059640	1061240	and often it was only later,
1061240	1064520	once the native peoples had been weakened, impoverished,
1064520	1070520	and rounded up into internment camps that epidemic diseases had the opportunity to spread.
1070520	1075480	In fact, not all disease deaths were even due to new diseases brought by the Europeans,
1075480	1081560	but rather existing diseases that the actions of the European Americans had made more dangerous.
1081560	1086600	Stefan's metaphor, in which one unintentionally gives someone else a disease which kills them,
1087240	1089240	with a hug, of all things,
1089240	1091480	is not really the most apt here.
1091480	1096120	A better metaphor would be one person imprisoning and starving another person
1096120	1099560	until they're so weak their body can no longer fight off disease.
1100200	1102520	And should that person then die of a disease,
1103160	1106120	how responsible would we say the imprisonment is?
1106120	1111240	Now, to be fair here, my metaphor there involves one person breaking the law.
1111880	1116280	And Stefan has claimed that whatever violent acts were committed against the Native Americans,
1116280	1118120	such as burning their food stores,
1118120	1122520	were justified by the laws of war that were accepted at the time.
1123080	1126520	So if that were true, my metaphor would also be a bad one.
1127240	1128840	So is Stefan right there?
1128840	1132200	We're now going to take a look at the sections of his video where he discusses
1132200	1136680	and attempts to justify the intentional violence inflicted upon the Native Americans.
1137320	1140840	Is it true that it was always justified by warfare?
1140840	1142040	Well, let's see.
1142040	1146520	And, of course, there are many different massacres and atrocities I could point to
1146520	1150200	and tell you about here where white people slaughtered defenseless,
1150200	1152840	peaceful Native people and destroyed their homes.
1153400	1154600	But I'll just do one.
1155320	1156840	The one I mentioned earlier.
1156840	1161160	Let's talk about the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864.
1161160	1165560	So way back in 1851, 13 years before the massacre,
1165560	1171480	the United States and several Native American tribes signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie,
1171480	1175720	in which the United States recognized large amounts of land as Native territory,
1175720	1178040	which they held no claim over.
1178040	1183080	This included parts of modern-day Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas.
1183080	1187000	So not exactly an insignificant amount of land there.
1187000	1190280	However, seven years later, in 1858,
1190280	1195800	gold was discovered in Colorado, triggering the Pike's Peak Gold Rush.
1195800	1199080	And that meant that a large amount of European American settlers
1199080	1205080	started violating the treaty and illegally moving into and settling on Native land.
1205080	1209080	Stefan at one point mentions a similar series of events in California,
1209080	1214120	stating the discovery of gold in California exacerbated tensions.
1214680	1221400	Now, what exacerbated tensions means is trigger the genocide of the Native population
1221400	1224760	in what's known to history as the California genocide.
1224760	1228760	And even by the most conservative possible definition of the word genocide,
1228760	1232600	what happened in California undoubtedly qualifies.
1232600	1236680	Militia groups waged a war of extermination against the Native people,
1236680	1240040	often with implicit, and sometimes even explicit,
1240040	1242600	support from both the state and federal governments.
1243240	1249480	In 1851, California governor John McDougall announced his intent to make war upon the Indians,
1249480	1255000	which must, of necessity, be one of extermination to many of the tribes.
1255000	1257560	And if that's not outright genocidal intent,
1258120	1259320	I don't know what is.
1259320	1262360	So that's your exacerbated tensions there.
1262360	1266920	What a wonderfully cowardly revisionist fig leaf that phrase is.
1266920	1272120	Tom broke into Bill's house, murdered his family, and stole all of his possessions.
1272120	1275320	And that really exacerbated tensions between the two.
1275960	1276840	Anyway.
1276840	1280360	So back to the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1858.
1281000	1285960	After the discovery of gold in Colorado, there was a flood of European American settlers
1285960	1291640	illegally crossing into Native lands and exacerbating tensions all over the place.
1291640	1293480	Now, in an attempt to keep the peace,
1293480	1298040	a designation of chiefs from both the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes
1298040	1301720	signed the Treaty of Fort Wise, ceding to the United States
1301720	1304600	most of the lands they currently held claim to.
1304600	1309080	This new territory was less than one-thirteenth the size of the land claimed by them
1309080	1311960	in the Treaty of Fort Laramie a decade earlier.
1311960	1316840	So they forked over the vast majority of their lands in order to keep the peace with the states.
1317640	1321080	Among the Cheyenne chiefs who signed the treaty were Black Kettle,
1321080	1323720	White Antelope, and Lean Bear.
1323720	1326280	And they're important, so remember those names.
1326280	1330040	Sorry, I realize there's a lot of dry history recitation in this section,
1330040	1333000	but I promise it's all important for fully realizing
1333000	1336920	just how incredibly fucked the Sand Creek Massacre was.
1336920	1341320	So three years later, 1864, the year of the massacre,
1341320	1345800	Colorado troops under the command of US Army Colonel John Chivington
1345800	1351560	began, without any declaration of war, mind, or real reason, apparently,
1351560	1354360	attacking and destroying Cheyenne camps.
1354360	1358680	And on May 16th, 1864, a detachment of these soldiers
1358680	1362600	encountered a group of Native Americans in a buffalo hunting camp.
1362600	1365720	This group included Black Kettle and Lean Bear,
1365720	1371000	two of the chiefs who had three years ago signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States.
1371080	1376440	Lean Bear rode out to meet the soldiers, fully confident of a peaceful encounter.
1376440	1380840	You see, Lean Bear had previously met with President Lincoln in the White House
1380840	1384040	and carried with him documents signed by Lincoln
1384040	1387480	explaining he was a friend of the United States and was peaceful.
1388280	1392200	As he approached the soldiers, they opened fire and murdered him.
1392200	1396440	They were acting on orders from Chivington to kill every Cheyenne they encountered.
1396440	1397880	And to quote the man himself,
1398760	1402680	I have come to kill Indians and believe it's right and honorable
1402680	1406600	to use any means under God's heaven to kill Indians.
1406600	1410840	Kill and scalp all, big and little, knits make lice.
1412040	1413160	Pleasant chap there.
1413880	1417480	Anyway, tensions now very exacerbated.
1417480	1422360	The governor of Colorado, John Evans, sent a letter to the various local tribes
1422360	1426200	inviting all who desired peace to report to Fort Lyon
1426200	1428520	where they would be recognized as peaceful
1428520	1431960	and placed under the protection of the United States government.
1431960	1435080	Black Kettle then led a group of his people to Fort Lyon
1435080	1438120	where they were directed to settle at Sand Creek.
1438120	1441000	In the center of the camp, over his lodge,
1441000	1445240	Black Kettle flew an American flag with a white flag tied beneath it
1445240	1449720	to signal they were peaceful and under the protection of the United States.
1449720	1453320	The majority of people present at the camp were women and children
1453320	1456120	as most of the warriors were away hunting.
1456200	1459480	So let's just recap how these people got here.
1459480	1462520	Two times they had signed treaties with the United States
1462520	1467160	and two times people from the United States had violated those treaties,
1467160	1470200	invaded their lands, and killed their people.
1470200	1473320	The natives had signed away most of their remaining lands
1473320	1476280	attempting to keep the peace with the United States.
1476280	1479720	Lean Bear, one of their chiefs, was murdered in cold blood
1479720	1482120	attempting to keep peace with the United States.
1482120	1486920	And now finally they had surrendered themselves to the mercy of the United States,
1486920	1488440	settled where they were told to,
1488440	1491320	and were fully under the impression that they were at peace
1491320	1494280	and had been guaranteed protection and safety.
1495000	1498360	Now, uh, content warning for this next bit.
1498360	1500920	I'm about to read some pretty nasty stuff.
1500920	1505560	If you're bothered by descriptions of violence, I'd skip ahead a little ways.
1505560	1509320	So okay, on November 29th, 1864,
1509320	1514760	Colonel Chivington had a detachment of his men surround the camp at Sand Creek with guns
1514760	1516760	and ordered them to open fire.
1516760	1521560	The women and children in the camp gathered around the American flag above Black Kettle's Lodge.
1522520	1525160	White Antelope, one of the chiefs I mentioned earlier,
1525160	1527320	was shot down as he approached the troops,
1527320	1529480	shouting for them to stop firing.
1529480	1531400	His body was later mutilated,
1531400	1535720	he was scalped and had his nose, ears, and genitals cut off.
1535720	1539240	The soldiers then moved into the camp with rifles and sabers
1539240	1541560	and massacred everyone they could.
1541560	1544440	Witness accounts speak of scalped children,
1544440	1546680	children with their brains knocked out,
1546680	1548520	pregnant women being cut open,
1549080	1552200	children being used as target practice by the soldiers,
1552840	1554760	mutilated corpses,
1554760	1557080	all manner of dreadful things like that.
1557080	1560520	More than 100 people were murdered at Sand Creek,
1560520	1562680	the majority women and children,
1562680	1564120	and all of them peaceful.
1564120	1567400	Black Kettle, the chief, managed to escape the camp
1567400	1571400	and somehow remained dedicated to achieving a lasting peace
1571400	1574680	right up until 1868 when he was shot in the back
1574680	1578520	and killed by US Army soldiers when he was crossing a river.
1578520	1581800	Chivington, the colonel who orchestrated the massacre,
1581800	1584120	never faced criminal charges.
1584120	1587480	So what does this guy have to say about Sand Creek,
1587480	1592360	or indeed any massacre or atrocity carried out against the Native Americans?
1592440	1595000	Well, absolutely nothing.
1595560	1599800	Stefan deals with the issue by just not mentioning it at all,
1599800	1605320	besides one passing reference to there being examples of cruelty on both sides.
1605960	1610840	There's no mention of Wounded Knee or Sand Creek or any other atrocity.
1610840	1613400	In fact, actually in a video entitled
1613400	1615960	The Truth About the Native American Genocide,
1615960	1619960	Stefan never once names or quotes a Native American person.
1620600	1622120	Does that seem odd to you?
1622120	1623640	Because it should.
1623640	1626600	How can a video profess to tell the truth about history
1626600	1629960	while completely ignoring one side of the history?
1629960	1633080	Stefan only talks about white violence against the Natives
1633080	1635560	when he thinks he can justify it.
1635560	1638200	And let's have a listen to him attempt to do that.
1639960	1641160	Now say what you like.
1641160	1644600	These actions were almost certainly in conformity with the laws of the war
1644600	1647800	that were accepted at the time.
1647800	1651320	The villagers of warring Natives who refused to surrender
1651320	1655560	were viewed as legitimate military targets and could be acted against,
1655560	1658120	and this of course occurred significantly later
1658120	1661080	when Churchill bombed the Germans and so on.
1661080	1664440	So like it or not, those are part of the rules of war at the time
1664440	1665800	and considerably thereafter.
1667240	1670040	So Stefan's argument is weak here, of course,
1670040	1673880	because there is no good argument in defense of what he's trying to defend.
1674600	1677640	He compares the destruction of Native American food stores
1677640	1681880	and villages to the Allied bombing of German cities in World War II,
1681880	1683880	which is a bit silly for several reasons.
1684600	1687400	Firstly, that Allied bombing of German cities
1687400	1689640	is actually a rather contentious issue.
1690280	1693560	But regardless of that, whatever your opinion of Churchill
1693560	1695560	or the actions of the Allied forces,
1695560	1699320	they were at the very least fighting against an expansionist,
1699320	1702280	genocidal fascist state that would have invaded
1702280	1705240	and conquered their countries if it had the opportunity.
1705240	1708360	The white people in America were fighting against
1708360	1711880	some Native people whose land they wanted to steal.
1711880	1716360	And Stefan's metaphor further casts the Native Americans as the Nazis,
1716360	1718920	which, you know, piss off.
1718920	1722360	The other way Stefan's argument is weak here is that throughout this section,
1722360	1727080	he mentions several instances of Native violence against white people.
1727080	1729960	And he's saying, this is what was normal at the time.
1729960	1732280	You can't blame anyone in particular for that.
1732280	1735480	It wasn't just the white people doing the violence.
1735480	1737560	Mom, mom, they did it too.
1738200	1742520	You know, it's a childish argument of moral equivalence there.
1742520	1745400	And I thought it was the leftist Marxist professor types
1745400	1747880	who went in for all that stuff, not you, Stefan.
1748440	1751640	Anyway, attempting to equate the violence of the Natives
1751640	1755640	with the violence of the European Americans is wrong for a few reasons.
1756520	1759000	Mainly, obviously, the scale.
1759480	1763720	The whites had cannons and rifles and organized military.
1763720	1767240	They had a much greater ability to inflict violence.
1767240	1769800	But even if we ignore that material inequality
1769800	1771960	and we give Native people all the same equipment
1771960	1775080	and assume an equal number of people killed on each side,
1775080	1778680	one side was still fighting to defend their lands from invasion
1778680	1781880	and the other side was the one doing the invading.
1781880	1786440	The Native people always come out morally superior if that's how we're measuring it.
1786440	1788760	The other odd thing about Stefan's argument here
1788760	1794760	is that he, in his introduction, mentions the superiority of white Western civilization.
1794760	1798040	That is, of course, what he's trying to preserve and defend,
1798040	1801720	the idea that white Western European people are superior.
1802360	1804520	Though I'm sure he wouldn't put it quite that bluntly.
1805400	1808360	This moral equivalence argument from later in his video
1808360	1811400	is completely at odds with that idea, however.
1811400	1816040	If you're trying to argue Western Europeans are supposedly a superior people,
1816600	1818520	then that's what you have to prove.
1818600	1822280	Moral superiority, not moral equivalence,
1822280	1826920	but they did it too, isn't a good enough argument, Stefan.
1826920	1829400	Anyway, we're getting pretty close to wrapping up now,
1829400	1832680	but before we do, I'd like to touch on a few more aspects
1832680	1836360	of the genocide debate that Stefan doesn't mention in his video.
1836360	1840840	And they relate to the following section of the UN's legal definition of genocide.
1840840	1841480	And I quote,
1842120	1846040	"...imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,
1846040	1849800	and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
1849800	1853080	Both these things can be classified as genocide."
1853080	1857880	So first up, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.
1857880	1862600	So, in the 1960s and 70s, the United States Indian Health Service
1862600	1865720	sterilized thousands of Native American women,
1865720	1870040	often without their consent, and sometimes without even their knowledge.
1872520	1874760	And well, that's all I have to say about that, really.
1874760	1877960	It so perfectly fits the exact legal definition there
1877960	1880360	that I don't really need to elaborate, I don't think.
1881080	1885720	Yes, that really happened, and no, Stefan doesn't mention it.
1885720	1890440	Next up is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
1890440	1891800	Well, I won't dwell on this,
1891800	1896440	but let's briefly talk about the Canadian-Indian residential school system.
1897240	1899240	So this was a system of boarding schools
1899240	1902360	that indigenous children were required to attend.
1902360	1904520	The purpose of these schools was to, quote,
1905080	1907640	"...kill the Indian to save the man."
1908600	1912280	A quote from a chap called Richard Henry Pratt there,
1912280	1914840	who founded the first such boarding school.
1914840	1919240	And these schools were notoriously harsh and brutal places to be.
1919240	1921960	They were located far from reservations,
1921960	1925640	so that the children would have little contact with their families or culture,
1925640	1930280	and thus separated, the children were forced to speak another language,
1930280	1933480	and the practice of native cultural activities was banned,
1933480	1936920	with corporal punishment being used to enforce these rules.
1936920	1941320	These schools, the purpose of which was obviously to eradicate native culture
1941320	1943160	and replace it with the dominant culture,
1943160	1945720	were operated into the 1980s.
1946360	1948600	And several apologies have since been issued
1948600	1950920	by the Canadian government on the matter.
1950920	1952120	So, there we go.
1952120	1955640	Two examples there of acts that can be called genocidal,
1955640	1959240	continuing into very recent times, only a few decades ago.
1959960	1962040	Stefan doesn't consider these factors.
1962760	1965480	Perhaps they don't meet his definition of genocide,
1965480	1967720	but it's worthwhile asking here,
1967720	1972200	what is Stefan's definition of genocide as presented in this video?
1972200	1975720	He seems to think that the only acceptable definition of genocide
1975720	1980280	is the total unanimous and unceasing attempt of one people
1980280	1981720	to wipe out another people.
1982440	1985160	And is that a reasonable definition?
1985160	1987560	I'll leave that up to you to decide.
1987640	1992120	So, we're back to arguing definitions of genocide again.
1992120	1994520	And I suppose much of the debate depends upon
1994520	1998680	whether you believe genocide describes the intent or the result.
1998680	2003480	Of course, for the most part, the United States wanted territorial expansion,
2003480	2006440	and it was willing to use genocide as both a threat
2006440	2009000	and a practical weapon to achieve that goal.
2009000	2012120	Stefan at one point mentions Thomas Jefferson's attempts
2012120	2014600	to inoculate natives against disease,
2014600	2017400	but even Jefferson, in other circumstances,
2017400	2020040	was willing to threaten native people with genocide.
2020600	2022200	In 1807, he wrote,
2036760	2039480	So, genocide was clearly on the table then,
2039480	2041000	at least as a threat.
2041000	2044280	And it's genocide as a means rather than an end,
2044280	2046520	but is that still genocide?
2046520	2048600	Well, personally, I've seen it argued that
2048600	2052280	ethnic cleansing is a more generally appropriate term here,
2052280	2054920	though I'd still argue that the history is peppered with,
2054920	2059800	at the very least, genocidal moments, genocidal incidents,
2059800	2064120	even if genocide wasn't continuous and unceasing government policy
2064120	2065800	throughout the whole period.
2065800	2068200	But regardless of how we classify it,
2068200	2070760	and this is going all the way back to the start of the video here,
2071320	2073720	Regardless of how we classify the actions
2073720	2076200	of the invading European Americans,
2076200	2079560	how they treated the Native Americans was, for the most part,
2079560	2082680	completely unjustified, morally wrong,
2082680	2085640	and only defensible if you, as Stefan does,
2085640	2088920	completely ignore the majority of the actual history.
2088920	2092440	I'd like to end today with a brief note about white guilt.
2092440	2095160	That being what Stefan says is behind the attempts
2095160	2098840	to distort the true history in which white people were always great.
2099720	2102120	Lawrence Southern has also used this excuse
2102120	2104840	to explain some of the horrible stuff she believes.
2104840	2108840	White people hate themselves and are so guilty about the sins of the past
2108840	2112360	that they're ignoring reality and deluding themselves in the present.
2112920	2115400	And, well, it's not true.
2115400	2118680	Now, I'm not saying white guilt is impossible as a concept,
2118680	2122920	just that people like Stefan and Lawrence Southern aren't applying it correctly.
2122920	2125880	Reading the history of what happened to the Native Americans,
2125880	2129640	I was often outraged, sometimes disgusted,
2129640	2132280	but I never felt personally guilty,
2132280	2135400	just saddened by what people can do to one another.
2135960	2137720	Acknowledging offense from the past
2137720	2140840	in which white people have been in the wrong isn't driven by guilt,
2141400	2142440	just honesty.
2143080	2145320	Understanding is not guilt.
2146040	2148120	Hiding from the historical record,
2148760	2150360	cherry-picking from it,
2150360	2153400	whitewashing it to erase atrocities committed,
2153400	2156680	well, that's real guilt in action right there.
2156680	2158040	Thanks for watching, everyone.
2158760	2161400	Like, subscribe, leave a comment,
2161400	2165720	and basically just have a grand old time interacting with YouTube right there.
2166520	2170600	Thanks especially, as always, to my supporters on Patreon,
2170600	2173400	who enable me to keep making videos like this.
2173960	2177320	We're closing in on our next goal, which is scary,
2177320	2180360	so head over there and check it out, if you feel like.
2180360	2185080	I'm also thinking of doing another Q&A video for 25k subscribers,
2185080	2186920	which should be coming up fairly soon.
2187800	2189800	So if you want to ask a question,
2189800	2191480	send it me over on Curious Cat,
2191480	2194600	and make sure to sign a name at the bottom if you want a name read out,
2194600	2197960	and put for your Q&A video at the top or something,
2198520	2200680	so I know it's not just a regular question.
2201320	2204280	Okay, folks, thanks a lot, and I'll see you next time.
