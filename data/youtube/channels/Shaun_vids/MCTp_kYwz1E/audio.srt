00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,280
On the 29th of July, the PragerU Twitter account posted this tweet,

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:06,840
which says,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,800
And it quotes said activist as saying,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,800
And if we click through, we see a video of a supposed civil rights activist participating in some sort of staged use of force training

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,720
intended to prove that the police just have to kill people.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,240
They can't help it.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,960
Never mind all those other countries with different police tactics where the police don't kill a fraction of the people as in the United States.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,600
Anyway, that aside, PragerU comments on this video about police tactics by saying,

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,080
It's that simple.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,760
Comply with the police or they can kill you is the message, of course. Simple enough.

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,080
And I'd like to compare that quote to this other tweet from PragerU posted on the 16th of July.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:11,120
There is a point at which law-abiding follows neither logic nor morality.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:19,680
From the 1930s Germany dissenters to Rosa Parks, history is full of noble examples of civil disobedience.

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
Dennis Prager reflects on the difficult question of when it's time to take a stand.

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:36,560
And the video posted with the tweet is of Dennis PragerU doing one of his fireside chats in which he states that he would disobey a law requiring him to use a mask outdoors.

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:20,480
Yes, Dennis Prager is the next Rosa Parks, I guess.

18
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,080
And, watching this clip, I was reminded of the following bit of advice given in the PragerU video, Cops are the Good Guys.

19
00:02:50,480 --> 00:03:05,760
Now, PragerU's position here, you've probably already noticed, seems a little contradictory, doesn't it?

20
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,880
On the one hand, they're saying that you have a duty to follow the law and obey commands from the police even if you disagree.

21
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,720
And on the other, they're saying that actually, disobeying laws you disagree with can be very noble and awesome and it's a good thing to break them.

22
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Now, this seeming hypocrisy should prompt a question.

23
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,680
If a police officer came up to Dennis PragerU outside and ordered him to put on a mask, would he do it?

24
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,000
I mean, he says that he wouldn't do it because he disagrees with the policy. He thinks it's absurd.

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,840
But his website and YouTube channel are plastered in messages saying that you should always obey the police even if you disagree with their commands.

26
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,800
So how do we explain this discrepancy?

27
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,840
Now, we could just say that Dennis Prager is a hypocrite who thinks that laws are for other people but he should get to do whatever he likes, right?

28
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,120
Which, to be fair, is probably at least partially true.

29
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,440
But we'd be missing something there, I think.

30
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,680
Because this isn't just an individual level Dennis Prager problem.

31
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,840
There's a deeper point to be made here about how conservatives across the board view the concept of the law.

32
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,600
And to explore this a little more, I want to take a look at a couple of points from a few different PragerU videos now.

33
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,880
And we'll stick with cops are the good guys for a minute.

34
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,560
So, just before the narrator starts talking about how you should always obey the police even if you disagree, he says the following.

35
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:41,040
It is this lack of respect for authority, fostered over decades by the progressive left and its Fear the Police narrative, that has led to the needless deaths of so many young black men.

36
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,920
When Officer Darren Wilson told Michael Brown to get out of the middle of the street in Ferguson, Missouri, did Brown comply?

37
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,880
No.

38
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,640
When officers in Baltimore told Freddie Gray to stop resisting arrest, did he comply?

39
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,600
No.

40
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,960
When officers in New York City told Eric Garner to stop resisting arrest, did he comply?

41
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,180
No.

42
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,120
So when he then goes on to talk about obeying the police being a matter of life and death,

43
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,160
it's explicitly in the context of the deaths of these black men who were killed by the police.

44
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,960
And there's a couple of important points to be made here.

45
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,800
Firstly is that Dennis Prager, as an old rich white man, can be reasonably sure that if he were to disobey an order from the police,

46
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,400
they would be unlikely, relatively speaking anyway, to immediately murder him.

47
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:37,680
When he talks about being willing to accept the consequences of disobeying the law, he's not imagining himself being shot or choked to death, is he?

48
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
He's imagining that consequence being, at most, probably a fine.

49
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,280
He's not imagining the sorts of things that happen to black people when they tell the police no.

50
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,560
So there's an obvious double standard here, isn't there?

51
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,480
How you react can be a matter of life or death is obviously more true for certain sections of the population than for others.

52
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,680
Dennis Prager is willing to accept his own consequences,

53
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,600
but he wouldn't be willing to accept Freddie Gray's consequences or Eric Garner's consequences.

54
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,160
Now, the other double standard going on here is between the victims of police violence and the police themselves.

55
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,920
Freddie Gray, for instance, was killed while in police custody.

56
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,920
His death was ruled a homicide after he was handcuffed and placed unrestrained in the back of a police van,

57
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,480
which was then driven around, during which time Gray received fatal injuries.

58
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,840
Gray not being secured with a seat belt while in the van was against the police department's policies.

59
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,040
The cops who were arresting Gray didn't follow their own rules, and as a result of that, they caused his death.

60
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:48,800
Similarly, Eric Garner was killed after being subjected to a chokehold, something which is prohibited by NYPD regulations.

61
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,120
The police officer who put Garner in the chokehold was later fired for it,

62
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,440
with an investigating judge writing that his use of a chokehold fell so far short of objective reasonableness

63
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,280
that this tribunal found it to be reckless, a gross deviation from the standard of conduct established for a New York City police officer.

64
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,360
And they also accuse him of being untruthful and disingenuous in his interviews with investigators.

65
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,400
But cops are the good guys, remember.

66
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,760
What we learn about PragerU's point of view here is that police should not be expected to have to act according to their own rules,

67
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,840
so long as they're serving their function within the conservative system.

68
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,840
And the function the police are serving here is to enforce an order, a hierarchical social order,

69
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,880
one with the conservative ingroup at the top and their outgroups at the bottom.

70
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,400
When conservatives demand compliance, it rarely has anything to do with the law as it is written.

71
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,120
Much more often, what they're demanding is compliance with this social hierarchy.

72
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,800
And I'd like to show you a very explicit example of what I'm talking about.

73
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,400
Back in September of 2019, in relation to the ongoing argument over the Trump administration's family separation policy,

74
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,360
conservative political commentator and regular PragerU contributor Candace Owens posted the following tweet.

75
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,480
Now, absent here is what Candace Owens actually thinks about the policy in question.

76
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,200
Is it a just policy? Is the punishment for breaking it proportional?

77
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:33,440
Is it fair to separate families who are just seeking asylum and put them through this horrible experience?

78
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
I mean, no, right? It's awful.

79
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,800
Taking children from their families and putting them in child prison, it's very villainous behavior, it's difficult to defend.

80
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:54,000
So what Owens does instead is shift the responsibility for this horrible thing to the victims of the horrible thing by hiding behind the law.

81
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,920
They're only being punished because they broke the law, she claims.

82
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,480
Whether the law is just or unjust doesn't matter here. The law is the law. Do not break the law.

83
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,360
Now, I find this a very narrow-minded and cowardly point of view, obviously.

84
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:19,280
Gesturing to the concept of lawfulness to avoid confronting the consequences of the policies you support is a cop-out, obviously, if you'll pardon the pun.

85
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:29,520
It's also a seemingly unusual line of defense in this case, anyway, because seeking asylum at an international border is not actually against the law to begin with.

86
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,880
So invoking the law here is a little strange. In many cases, no laws have been broken.

87
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:43,600
Anyway, I want to compare this tweet to another tweet from Candace Owens, now one from December of 2020 concerning coronavirus lockdown orders.

88
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:54,240
For years, I have used my platform to hashtag back the blue when the media and left-wing politicians baselessly attack LEOs, that's law enforcement officers.

89
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:04,320
Now it's time to discover if the blue backs us. I stand with every business owner who is opening their doors in defiance of tyrannical Democrat lockdowns.

90
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:17,600
So this tweet was posted in relation to a news story about a restaurant owner in Michigan who was keeping his restaurant open for indoor dining despite lockdown orders saying not to do that on account of the coronavirus pandemic.

91
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:25,760
And as a result of that, he was fined by the government. So we have to ask why Candace Owens responded so differently in this case.

92
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,800
These orders were lawful orders issued by democratically elected leaders.

93
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:39,600
If Candace Owens was being consistent in her beliefs, she would say if you're a restaurant owner who doesn't want to be fined, just don't break the law, right?

94
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,720
But she doesn't do that here. She does just the opposite, in fact, and expresses support for business owners defying the lockdown.

95
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:54,480
She also cites her own support of the police in her call for them to stand with the business owners by not enforcing the law.

96
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,240
The actual written law is obviously a distant second here to enforcing the hierarchy.

97
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,360
A hierarchy in which business owners rank highly and thus should be protected by the police even as they break the law,

98
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,240
but asylum seekers rank lowly and thus should be punished as if they have broken the law even if they haven't.

99
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,400
I'd like now to take a look at a similar example from the PragerU video,

100
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
What Do We Do About The Homeless?

101
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,480
And we can see the in-group versus out-group mindset very clearly right from the title here.

102
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,600
What Do We Do About The Homeless?

103
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,240
This video makes the disgusting argument that homelessness is some sort of individual moral failing or, like,

104
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,960
just some bad decision people are making, and the solution is, of course, to get tough on homelessness.

105
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:50,880
And they judge success not by housing homeless people or improving their lives somehow, but by making them go away, basically.

106
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,200
Now, there's a good video by the YouTube channel Thought Slime which goes into this video in more detail than I'm going to,

107
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,040
and I'll link that below in the video description if you'd like to check it out.

108
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,720
What I want to focus on in my video is the following clip.

109
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,600
Make your city attractive for the homeless, and they'll beat a path to your doorway.

110
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,200
The Venice Boulevard underpass on the border of Los Angeles and Culver City brings home this point.

111
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,040
It's one of thousands of concrete structures in Los Angeles County, but there's a curious detail.

112
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,160
The Los Angeles side is full of tents, and the Culver City side is empty.

113
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,440
Why?

114
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
Because the two cities have different public policies.

115
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:38,160
Los Angeles has effectively decriminalized public camping and drug consumption, while Culver City enforces the law.

116
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,480
So, firstly, let's take this series of statements at face value and imagine they're true.

117
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,920
They're not true, but for the moment, we'll pretend, right?

118
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,080
And you might already see a problem here.

119
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,440
The two cities have different public policies.

120
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,760
Los Angeles has effectively decriminalized public camping and drug consumption, while Culver City enforces the law.

121
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,440
Now, what does this mean with regards to the law?

122
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,920
If LA did actually decriminalize public camping and drug consumption,

123
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,560
then they wouldn't be failing to enforce the law by not treating people as criminals for doing those things.

124
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,600
Because they wouldn't be criminal acts, would they?

125
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,000
This PragerU video appears to take the position that camping under an underpass is, by default, illegal,

126
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,960
according to some sort of objective, universal truth that supersedes what the actual written laws are.

127
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,640
And this all gets weirder when we look into the source for their claim about the Venice Boulevard underpass,

128
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,480
and that's an LA Times article from June 2019 titled,

129
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,360
"'Neighboring cities are pushing homeless into LA,' Councilman alleged."

130
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,240
The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that homeless individuals

131
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,800
may not be held criminally responsible for sleeping on government property when no alternative shelter is available.

132
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,760
City Councilmember Mike Bonin, whose council district touches Santa Monica, Culver City, and El Segundo,

133
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,880
said he believes many cities in the region are not complying with that decision.

134
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,440
Instead of allowing people to sleep on their sidewalks,

135
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,960
they're encouraging people or compelling people to move to the city of Los Angeles to do that, he said.

136
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,760
Such a disparity can be seen on Venice Boulevard at the 405 freeway, Bonin said,

137
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,400
with homeless people on the LA side of the street but not on the Culver City side.

138
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,320
People are understandably asking why the hell that is, Bonin said,

139
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,960
and it's because the city of Los Angeles is obeying the court dictates and the city across the street isn't.

140
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,880
Now this is interesting, isn't it?

141
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,560
PragerU's source here contains the exact opposite claim that they make in their video.

142
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,200
They say that LA is not enforcing the law while Culver City is,

143
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,160
but their source for that information, an LA City Councilmember quoted in the LA Times,

144
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,840
claims that the disparity in homeless populations between those two places

145
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,880
was because LA was complying with the law and Culver City wasn't.

146
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,720
The article even quotes someone who has been living under the underpass who say,

147
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,400
So firstly, PragerU's overall point is ridiculous, obviously.

148
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,880
Even if they were right here, Culver City wouldn't have solved homelessness

149
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,560
just by forcing all the homeless people to go somewhere else.

150
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,480
And if LA does, air quotes,

151
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,240
enforce the law in a similar way and also start forcing all the homeless people to go elsewhere,

152
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,480
that wouldn't solve anything either.

153
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
And coincidentally, LA did actually recently take measures to criminalize homelessness,

154
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,040
which, coupled with the suspension on evictions due to the coronavirus being allowed to expire,

155
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,120
seems particularly cruel.

156
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,400
Of course, getting tough on homelessness is not actually about addressing homelessness.

157
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,400
It's about enforcing the same hierarchy that we talked about earlier.

158
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,000
Homeless people, like asylum seekers, are low down in the conservative hierarchy

159
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,640
and thus just are illegal, intrinsically, all the time.

160
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,400
From the conservative perspective,

161
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,000
enforcing the law here means punishing homeless people and punishing asylum seekers,

162
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,320
regardless of what the actual law is or if it was broken.

163
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,080
They're below us on the ladder, which means we kick them in the head.

164
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,360
That's the point.

165
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,040
This isn't a means to an end, it's just the end.

166
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,240
And I'm reminded of the story of the Trump voter who,

167
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,960
feeling let down by his administration,

168
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,200
expressed their disappointment by saying,

169
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,040
He's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting,

170
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,400
revealing that they supported Trump specifically because they wanted him to hurt people.

171
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,440
They just didn't think the one being hurt would be them.

172
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'd like to move on now and talk about how this conservative view of the law

173
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,880
interacts with the partisan political divide.

174
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,000
But one thing I'd like to make clear first here is that when I've been saying conservative today,

175
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,120
I do not mean Republican, as in the Republican Party in the United States.

176
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,680
Now, there's a lot of overlap there, of course,

177
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:20,160
but the Republicans by no means have a monopoly on this sort of hierarchical in-group, out-group thinking.

178
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,760
PragerU and their Republican commentators obviously try to weaponize law and order narratives

179
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,600
against the Democrats, painting them as weak on crime and so on.

180
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,040
But this does not mean that the Democrats are not just as able to use the same conservative messaging,

181
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,160
as we just saw with the Democratic mayor of LA cracking down on homelessness.

182
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
Not that PragerU cares much, of course.

183
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,920
The particular rhetorical trick they use to score points against the Democrats is this.

184
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,960
If the leader is a Republican, then the laws are just the law, innately.

185
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,440
Whereas if the leader is a Democrat, laws are called Democrat laws,

186
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,920
and they're described as absurd or biased or tyrannical.

187
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,920
And there's certainly something to be said here about how PragerU swapped from saying

188
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,000
follow the law without question under a Republican president

189
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
to not following the law makes you like Rosa Parks, actually,

190
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,040
right around the time a Democrat came into office.

191
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,400
I'd like now to take a look at another PragerU video titled

192
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,560
Is Voter Fraud Real?, which opens with the following statement.

193
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,920
While the major media fixates on the influence of foreign powers on American elections,

194
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,800
a much more serious attack has been taking place right under our noses.

195
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,920
Good, old-fashioned, homegrown voter fraud.

196
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,120
Let's look at three of the worst offenses.

197
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,320
And then it goes on to talk about all the terrible voter fraud

198
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,800
that is probably for sure happening wherever Republicans happen to not be winning elections, right?

199
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,880
Shockingly, the video does actually mention the hypothetical possibility of Republican corruption.

200
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,760
However, all the actual examples of supposed voter fraud contained within the video

201
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,400
are in places where Democrats won elections over their Republican rivals.

202
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,160
And we see in this video the same disconnect between the conservative ideal of the law

203
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,920
and the actual law.

204
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,840
The second of their voter fraud examples is to complain about California legalizing,

205
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,720
quote, the practice of ballot solicitation,

206
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
saying organizations are legally permitted to go to a location,

207
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,480
say a nursing home or a church, and collect ballots.

208
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,920
Now, this seems obvious, of course, but if this practice is legal, as they state,

209
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,560
then it wouldn't be voter fraud, would it?

210
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,160
Because it would be legal.

211
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,840
What PragerU are actually concerned about here is a possible altering of the votes

212
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
after they've been collected,

213
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,960
but that doesn't make the collecting of the votes fraud if it's legal to do so, does it?

214
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,840
They also lay the blame for ballot harvesting specifically at the feet of the left,

215
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,320
or who they think the left is, anyway,

216
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,600
saying it's one of the, quote,

217
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,640
ways in which the left creates a clear advantage for itself on election day.

218
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,160
And in light of that, quote, let me just read you a brief news story here.

219
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,200
California Republicans embrace legally dubious ballot harvesting

220
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,800
after Trump and the GOP spent months decrying the practice.

221
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,880
The California Republican Party doubled down on its use of unauthorized ballot drop boxes,

222
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,360
potentially in violation of state law,

223
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,160
shortly before state officials issued cease and desist orders compelling them to stop.

224
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,480
Election officials are investigating and addressing multiple instances

225
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,040
in Los Angeles, Orange, and Fresno counties

226
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,000
of Republicans setting up unauthorized drop boxes for their voters' mail ballots.

227
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,680
The state Republican Party defended itself on Twitter by citing

228
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,200
California law allowing third-party ballot collection,

229
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,360
but officials have noted that state law clearly prohibits drop boxes

230
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,000
not established by election officials.

231
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,080
Anyway, I wouldn't blame anyone for thinking voter fraud is an odd crime

232
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,560
for PragerU to be concerned about to begin with,

233
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,240
given their frequent collaborations with Dinesh D'Souza.

234
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,680
Now, D'Souza is the narrator of several PragerU videos,

235
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,040
such as Are Some Cultures Better Than Others?,

236
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,960
Capitalism or Socialism?,

237
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,200
Which One is More Democratic?,

238
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,840
and Is Fascism Right or Left?

239
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,600
Who knows?

240
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,360
In addition to being the narrator of these PragerU videos,

241
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,320
Dinesh D'Souza is also a convicted felon

242
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,960
who pled guilty to committing election fraud

243
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,400
by way of making illegal campaign contributions.

244
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
D'Souza was sentenced to eight months in a community confinement center,

245
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,840
five years probation, and to pay a $30,000 fine.

246
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,120
So when PragerU say election fraud has been taking place right under their noses,

247
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,280
well, yes, it has.

248
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,480
Now, I'd like to end today with a quote.

249
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,520
This quote is often attributed to American political scientist Francis M. Wilhite,

250
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,480
but upon investigation it appears it was actually posted in the comments of an internet blog

251
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,440
several years after Francis M. Wilhite died

252
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,120
by a different fellow by the name of Frank Wilhite.

253
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,560
And that's one way to secure yourself a memorable quote, isn't it?

254
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,400
Just have a very similar name to a famous political scientist.

255
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,120
Anyway, internet blog comment or no.

256
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,520
I like the quote, so there you go.

257
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,440
Thanks a lot for watching today, folks.

258
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,960
And thank you especially to my supporters over on Patreon,

259
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,440
some of whom should be scrolling by right now.

260
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,000
Patrons get early access to all my videos,

261
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,880
which I'm told is a high so incredibly thrilling

262
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,200
that the remainder of your life will appear drab and boring by comparison.

263
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,880
Seems a little exaggerated to me, but that's what I am told, apparently.

264
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,800
Someone told me that.

265
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,600
You can't prove they didn't.
