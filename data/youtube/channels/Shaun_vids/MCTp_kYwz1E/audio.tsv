0	1520	Hello, everyone.
1520	6280	On the 29th of July, the PragerU Twitter account posted this tweet,
6280	6840	which says,
10840	12800	And it quotes said activist as saying,
16440	23800	And if we click through, we see a video of a supposed civil rights activist participating in some sort of staged use of force training
23800	26720	intended to prove that the police just have to kill people.
26720	28240	They can't help it.
28240	34960	Never mind all those other countries with different police tactics where the police don't kill a fraction of the people as in the United States.
34960	39600	Anyway, that aside, PragerU comments on this video about police tactics by saying,
42600	44080	It's that simple.
44080	49760	Comply with the police or they can kill you is the message, of course. Simple enough.
49760	56080	And I'd like to compare that quote to this other tweet from PragerU posted on the 16th of July.
58240	71120	There is a point at which law-abiding follows neither logic nor morality.
71120	79680	From the 1930s Germany dissenters to Rosa Parks, history is full of noble examples of civil disobedience.
79680	84880	Dennis Prager reflects on the difficult question of when it's time to take a stand.
84880	96560	And the video posted with the tweet is of Dennis PragerU doing one of his fireside chats in which he states that he would disobey a law requiring him to use a mask outdoors.
114880	140480	Yes, Dennis Prager is the next Rosa Parks, I guess.
140480	148080	And, watching this clip, I was reminded of the following bit of advice given in the PragerU video, Cops are the Good Guys.
170480	185760	Now, PragerU's position here, you've probably already noticed, seems a little contradictory, doesn't it?
185760	192880	On the one hand, they're saying that you have a duty to follow the law and obey commands from the police even if you disagree.
192880	200720	And on the other, they're saying that actually, disobeying laws you disagree with can be very noble and awesome and it's a good thing to break them.
200720	204720	Now, this seeming hypocrisy should prompt a question.
204720	211680	If a police officer came up to Dennis PragerU outside and ordered him to put on a mask, would he do it?
211680	218000	I mean, he says that he wouldn't do it because he disagrees with the policy. He thinks it's absurd.
218000	225840	But his website and YouTube channel are plastered in messages saying that you should always obey the police even if you disagree with their commands.
225840	228800	So how do we explain this discrepancy?
228800	235840	Now, we could just say that Dennis Prager is a hypocrite who thinks that laws are for other people but he should get to do whatever he likes, right?
235840	239120	Which, to be fair, is probably at least partially true.
239120	241440	But we'd be missing something there, I think.
241440	245680	Because this isn't just an individual level Dennis Prager problem.
245680	251840	There's a deeper point to be made here about how conservatives across the board view the concept of the law.
251840	257600	And to explore this a little more, I want to take a look at a couple of points from a few different PragerU videos now.
257600	260880	And we'll stick with cops are the good guys for a minute.
260880	268560	So, just before the narrator starts talking about how you should always obey the police even if you disagree, he says the following.
268560	281040	It is this lack of respect for authority, fostered over decades by the progressive left and its Fear the Police narrative, that has led to the needless deaths of so many young black men.
281040	287920	When Officer Darren Wilson told Michael Brown to get out of the middle of the street in Ferguson, Missouri, did Brown comply?
287920	288880	No.
288880	294640	When officers in Baltimore told Freddie Gray to stop resisting arrest, did he comply?
294640	295600	No.
295600	300960	When officers in New York City told Eric Garner to stop resisting arrest, did he comply?
301680	302180	No.
302560	307120	So when he then goes on to talk about obeying the police being a matter of life and death,
307120	312160	it's explicitly in the context of the deaths of these black men who were killed by the police.
312160	314960	And there's a couple of important points to be made here.
314960	322800	Firstly is that Dennis Prager, as an old rich white man, can be reasonably sure that if he were to disobey an order from the police,
322800	328400	they would be unlikely, relatively speaking anyway, to immediately murder him.
328400	337680	When he talks about being willing to accept the consequences of disobeying the law, he's not imagining himself being shot or choked to death, is he?
337680	342160	He's imagining that consequence being, at most, probably a fine.
342160	347280	He's not imagining the sorts of things that happen to black people when they tell the police no.
347280	350560	So there's an obvious double standard here, isn't there?
350560	358480	How you react can be a matter of life or death is obviously more true for certain sections of the population than for others.
358480	361680	Dennis Prager is willing to accept his own consequences,
361680	367600	but he wouldn't be willing to accept Freddie Gray's consequences or Eric Garner's consequences.
367600	374160	Now, the other double standard going on here is between the victims of police violence and the police themselves.
374160	377920	Freddie Gray, for instance, was killed while in police custody.
377920	383920	His death was ruled a homicide after he was handcuffed and placed unrestrained in the back of a police van,
383920	388480	which was then driven around, during which time Gray received fatal injuries.
388480	393840	Gray not being secured with a seat belt while in the van was against the police department's policies.
393840	401040	The cops who were arresting Gray didn't follow their own rules, and as a result of that, they caused his death.
401040	408800	Similarly, Eric Garner was killed after being subjected to a chokehold, something which is prohibited by NYPD regulations.
408800	413120	The police officer who put Garner in the chokehold was later fired for it,
413120	419440	with an investigating judge writing that his use of a chokehold fell so far short of objective reasonableness
419440	427280	that this tribunal found it to be reckless, a gross deviation from the standard of conduct established for a New York City police officer.
427280	433360	And they also accuse him of being untruthful and disingenuous in his interviews with investigators.
433360	436400	But cops are the good guys, remember.
436400	443760	What we learn about PragerU's point of view here is that police should not be expected to have to act according to their own rules,
443760	447840	so long as they're serving their function within the conservative system.
447840	453840	And the function the police are serving here is to enforce an order, a hierarchical social order,
453920	458880	one with the conservative ingroup at the top and their outgroups at the bottom.
458880	464400	When conservatives demand compliance, it rarely has anything to do with the law as it is written.
464400	469120	Much more often, what they're demanding is compliance with this social hierarchy.
469120	472800	And I'd like to show you a very explicit example of what I'm talking about.
472800	480400	Back in September of 2019, in relation to the ongoing argument over the Trump administration's family separation policy,
480400	487360	conservative political commentator and regular PragerU contributor Candace Owens posted the following tweet.
497120	502480	Now, absent here is what Candace Owens actually thinks about the policy in question.
502480	507200	Is it a just policy? Is the punishment for breaking it proportional?
507200	513440	Is it fair to separate families who are just seeking asylum and put them through this horrible experience?
513440	516640	I mean, no, right? It's awful.
516640	524800	Taking children from their families and putting them in child prison, it's very villainous behavior, it's difficult to defend.
524800	534000	So what Owens does instead is shift the responsibility for this horrible thing to the victims of the horrible thing by hiding behind the law.
534000	537920	They're only being punished because they broke the law, she claims.
537920	544480	Whether the law is just or unjust doesn't matter here. The law is the law. Do not break the law.
544480	549360	Now, I find this a very narrow-minded and cowardly point of view, obviously.
549360	559280	Gesturing to the concept of lawfulness to avoid confronting the consequences of the policies you support is a cop-out, obviously, if you'll pardon the pun.
559360	569520	It's also a seemingly unusual line of defense in this case, anyway, because seeking asylum at an international border is not actually against the law to begin with.
569520	574880	So invoking the law here is a little strange. In many cases, no laws have been broken.
574880	583600	Anyway, I want to compare this tweet to another tweet from Candace Owens, now one from December of 2020 concerning coronavirus lockdown orders.
583600	594240	For years, I have used my platform to hashtag back the blue when the media and left-wing politicians baselessly attack LEOs, that's law enforcement officers.
594240	604320	Now it's time to discover if the blue backs us. I stand with every business owner who is opening their doors in defiance of tyrannical Democrat lockdowns.
604320	617600	So this tweet was posted in relation to a news story about a restaurant owner in Michigan who was keeping his restaurant open for indoor dining despite lockdown orders saying not to do that on account of the coronavirus pandemic.
617600	625760	And as a result of that, he was fined by the government. So we have to ask why Candace Owens responded so differently in this case.
625760	630800	These orders were lawful orders issued by democratically elected leaders.
630800	639600	If Candace Owens was being consistent in her beliefs, she would say if you're a restaurant owner who doesn't want to be fined, just don't break the law, right?
639600	646720	But she doesn't do that here. She does just the opposite, in fact, and expresses support for business owners defying the lockdown.
646720	654480	She also cites her own support of the police in her call for them to stand with the business owners by not enforcing the law.
654480	660240	The actual written law is obviously a distant second here to enforcing the hierarchy.
660240	667360	A hierarchy in which business owners rank highly and thus should be protected by the police even as they break the law,
667360	674240	but asylum seekers rank lowly and thus should be punished as if they have broken the law even if they haven't.
674240	678400	I'd like now to take a look at a similar example from the PragerU video,
678400	680800	What Do We Do About The Homeless?
680800	686480	And we can see the in-group versus out-group mindset very clearly right from the title here.
686480	689600	What Do We Do About The Homeless?
689600	696240	This video makes the disgusting argument that homelessness is some sort of individual moral failing or, like,
696240	702960	just some bad decision people are making, and the solution is, of course, to get tough on homelessness.
702960	710880	And they judge success not by housing homeless people or improving their lives somehow, but by making them go away, basically.
710880	717200	Now, there's a good video by the YouTube channel Thought Slime which goes into this video in more detail than I'm going to,
717200	721040	and I'll link that below in the video description if you'd like to check it out.
721040	724720	What I want to focus on in my video is the following clip.
724720	729600	Make your city attractive for the homeless, and they'll beat a path to your doorway.
729600	735200	The Venice Boulevard underpass on the border of Los Angeles and Culver City brings home this point.
735200	741040	It's one of thousands of concrete structures in Los Angeles County, but there's a curious detail.
741040	746160	The Los Angeles side is full of tents, and the Culver City side is empty.
746160	747440	Why?
747440	751040	Because the two cities have different public policies.
751040	758160	Los Angeles has effectively decriminalized public camping and drug consumption, while Culver City enforces the law.
758160	764480	So, firstly, let's take this series of statements at face value and imagine they're true.
764480	767920	They're not true, but for the moment, we'll pretend, right?
767920	770080	And you might already see a problem here.
770080	773440	The two cities have different public policies.
773440	781760	Los Angeles has effectively decriminalized public camping and drug consumption, while Culver City enforces the law.
781760	785440	Now, what does this mean with regards to the law?
785440	789920	If LA did actually decriminalize public camping and drug consumption,
789920	796560	then they wouldn't be failing to enforce the law by not treating people as criminals for doing those things.
796560	799600	Because they wouldn't be criminal acts, would they?
799600	806000	This PragerU video appears to take the position that camping under an underpass is, by default, illegal,
806000	812960	according to some sort of objective, universal truth that supersedes what the actual written laws are.
812960	818640	And this all gets weirder when we look into the source for their claim about the Venice Boulevard underpass,
818640	822480	and that's an LA Times article from June 2019 titled,
822480	827360	"'Neighboring cities are pushing homeless into LA,' Councilman alleged."
827360	832240	The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that homeless individuals
832240	838800	may not be held criminally responsible for sleeping on government property when no alternative shelter is available.
838800	845760	City Councilmember Mike Bonin, whose council district touches Santa Monica, Culver City, and El Segundo,
845760	850880	said he believes many cities in the region are not complying with that decision.
850880	853440	Instead of allowing people to sleep on their sidewalks,
853440	858960	they're encouraging people or compelling people to move to the city of Los Angeles to do that, he said.
858960	863760	Such a disparity can be seen on Venice Boulevard at the 405 freeway, Bonin said,
863760	868400	with homeless people on the LA side of the street but not on the Culver City side.
868400	872320	People are understandably asking why the hell that is, Bonin said,
872320	878960	and it's because the city of Los Angeles is obeying the court dictates and the city across the street isn't.
878960	880880	Now this is interesting, isn't it?
880880	886560	PragerU's source here contains the exact opposite claim that they make in their video.
886560	891200	They say that LA is not enforcing the law while Culver City is,
891200	896160	but their source for that information, an LA City Councilmember quoted in the LA Times,
896160	899840	claims that the disparity in homeless populations between those two places
899840	904880	was because LA was complying with the law and Culver City wasn't.
904880	908720	The article even quotes someone who has been living under the underpass who say,
917760	922400	So firstly, PragerU's overall point is ridiculous, obviously.
922480	926880	Even if they were right here, Culver City wouldn't have solved homelessness
926880	930560	just by forcing all the homeless people to go somewhere else.
930560	932480	And if LA does, air quotes,
932480	938240	enforce the law in a similar way and also start forcing all the homeless people to go elsewhere,
938240	940480	that wouldn't solve anything either.
940480	945680	And coincidentally, LA did actually recently take measures to criminalize homelessness,
945680	951040	which, coupled with the suspension on evictions due to the coronavirus being allowed to expire,
951040	953120	seems particularly cruel.
953120	958400	Of course, getting tough on homelessness is not actually about addressing homelessness.
958400	962400	It's about enforcing the same hierarchy that we talked about earlier.
963040	968000	Homeless people, like asylum seekers, are low down in the conservative hierarchy
968000	972640	and thus just are illegal, intrinsically, all the time.
972640	974400	From the conservative perspective,
974400	980000	enforcing the law here means punishing homeless people and punishing asylum seekers,
980000	984320	regardless of what the actual law is or if it was broken.
984320	988080	They're below us on the ladder, which means we kick them in the head.
988080	989360	That's the point.
989360	993040	This isn't a means to an end, it's just the end.
993040	996240	And I'm reminded of the story of the Trump voter who,
996240	998960	feeling let down by his administration,
998960	1001200	expressed their disappointment by saying,
1001200	1005040	He's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting,
1005040	1010400	revealing that they supported Trump specifically because they wanted him to hurt people.
1010400	1013440	They just didn't think the one being hurt would be them.
1014000	1018000	I'd like to move on now and talk about how this conservative view of the law
1018000	1020880	interacts with the partisan political divide.
1020880	1026000	But one thing I'd like to make clear first here is that when I've been saying conservative today,
1026000	1031120	I do not mean Republican, as in the Republican Party in the United States.
1031120	1033680	Now, there's a lot of overlap there, of course,
1033680	1040160	but the Republicans by no means have a monopoly on this sort of hierarchical in-group, out-group thinking.
1040160	1045760	PragerU and their Republican commentators obviously try to weaponize law and order narratives
1045760	1049600	against the Democrats, painting them as weak on crime and so on.
1049600	1055040	But this does not mean that the Democrats are not just as able to use the same conservative messaging,
1055040	1060160	as we just saw with the Democratic mayor of LA cracking down on homelessness.
1060160	1063200	Not that PragerU cares much, of course.
1063200	1067920	The particular rhetorical trick they use to score points against the Democrats is this.
1067920	1072960	If the leader is a Republican, then the laws are just the law, innately.
1072960	1077440	Whereas if the leader is a Democrat, laws are called Democrat laws,
1077440	1081920	and they're described as absurd or biased or tyrannical.
1081920	1085920	And there's certainly something to be said here about how PragerU swapped from saying
1085920	1090000	follow the law without question under a Republican president
1090000	1094000	to not following the law makes you like Rosa Parks, actually,
1094000	1097040	right around the time a Democrat came into office.
1097040	1100400	I'd like now to take a look at another PragerU video titled
1100400	1104560	Is Voter Fraud Real?, which opens with the following statement.
1104560	1109920	While the major media fixates on the influence of foreign powers on American elections,
1109920	1114800	a much more serious attack has been taking place right under our noses.
1114800	1117920	Good, old-fashioned, homegrown voter fraud.
1118480	1121120	Let's look at three of the worst offenses.
1121120	1124320	And then it goes on to talk about all the terrible voter fraud
1124320	1130800	that is probably for sure happening wherever Republicans happen to not be winning elections, right?
1130800	1136880	Shockingly, the video does actually mention the hypothetical possibility of Republican corruption.
1136880	1141760	However, all the actual examples of supposed voter fraud contained within the video
1141760	1146400	are in places where Democrats won elections over their Republican rivals.
1146400	1152160	And we see in this video the same disconnect between the conservative ideal of the law
1152160	1153920	and the actual law.
1153920	1159840	The second of their voter fraud examples is to complain about California legalizing,
1159840	1162720	quote, the practice of ballot solicitation,
1162720	1166720	saying organizations are legally permitted to go to a location,
1166720	1170480	say a nursing home or a church, and collect ballots.
1170480	1175920	Now, this seems obvious, of course, but if this practice is legal, as they state,
1175920	1178560	then it wouldn't be voter fraud, would it?
1178560	1180160	Because it would be legal.
1180800	1185840	What PragerU are actually concerned about here is a possible altering of the votes
1185840	1187600	after they've been collected,
1187600	1192960	but that doesn't make the collecting of the votes fraud if it's legal to do so, does it?
1192960	1197840	They also lay the blame for ballot harvesting specifically at the feet of the left,
1197840	1200320	or who they think the left is, anyway,
1200320	1201600	saying it's one of the, quote,
1201600	1206640	ways in which the left creates a clear advantage for itself on election day.
1206640	1210160	And in light of that, quote, let me just read you a brief news story here.
1211040	1215200	California Republicans embrace legally dubious ballot harvesting
1215200	1218800	after Trump and the GOP spent months decrying the practice.
1218800	1224880	The California Republican Party doubled down on its use of unauthorized ballot drop boxes,
1224880	1227360	potentially in violation of state law,
1227360	1232160	shortly before state officials issued cease and desist orders compelling them to stop.
1232880	1236480	Election officials are investigating and addressing multiple instances
1236480	1239040	in Los Angeles, Orange, and Fresno counties
1239040	1244000	of Republicans setting up unauthorized drop boxes for their voters' mail ballots.
1244000	1247680	The state Republican Party defended itself on Twitter by citing
1247680	1251200	California law allowing third-party ballot collection,
1251200	1255360	but officials have noted that state law clearly prohibits drop boxes
1255360	1258000	not established by election officials.
1258000	1262080	Anyway, I wouldn't blame anyone for thinking voter fraud is an odd crime
1262080	1264560	for PragerU to be concerned about to begin with,
1264560	1268240	given their frequent collaborations with Dinesh D'Souza.
1268240	1271680	Now, D'Souza is the narrator of several PragerU videos,
1271680	1275040	such as Are Some Cultures Better Than Others?,
1275040	1276960	Capitalism or Socialism?,
1276960	1279200	Which One is More Democratic?,
1279200	1281840	and Is Fascism Right or Left?
1282960	1283600	Who knows?
1284160	1287360	In addition to being the narrator of these PragerU videos,
1287360	1290320	Dinesh D'Souza is also a convicted felon
1290320	1292960	who pled guilty to committing election fraud
1292960	1296400	by way of making illegal campaign contributions.
1296400	1300000	D'Souza was sentenced to eight months in a community confinement center,
1300000	1303840	five years probation, and to pay a $30,000 fine.
1303840	1309120	So when PragerU say election fraud has been taking place right under their noses,
1309120	1311280	well, yes, it has.
1312080	1314480	Now, I'd like to end today with a quote.
1328400	1333520	This quote is often attributed to American political scientist Francis M. Wilhite,
1333520	1338480	but upon investigation it appears it was actually posted in the comments of an internet blog
1338560	1341440	several years after Francis M. Wilhite died
1341440	1345120	by a different fellow by the name of Frank Wilhite.
1345120	1348560	And that's one way to secure yourself a memorable quote, isn't it?
1348560	1352400	Just have a very similar name to a famous political scientist.
1352400	1355120	Anyway, internet blog comment or no.
1355120	1357520	I like the quote, so there you go.
1357520	1359440	Thanks a lot for watching today, folks.
1359440	1362960	And thank you especially to my supporters over on Patreon,
1362960	1365440	some of whom should be scrolling by right now.
1365440	1368000	Patrons get early access to all my videos,
1368000	1370880	which I'm told is a high so incredibly thrilling
1370880	1375200	that the remainder of your life will appear drab and boring by comparison.
1377920	1382880	Seems a little exaggerated to me, but that's what I am told, apparently.
1383440	1384800	Someone told me that.
1386080	1387600	You can't prove they didn't.
