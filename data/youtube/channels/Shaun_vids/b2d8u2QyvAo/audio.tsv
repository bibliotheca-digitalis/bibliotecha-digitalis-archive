0	6600	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about former President Trump's 1776 Commission,
6600	10700	which he set up to promote what he called patriotic education.
10700	19600	The 1776 Commission released the 1776 Report on the 18th of January, just two days before Trump left office.
19600	26100	Incoming President Joe Biden dissolved the 1776 Commission on the first day of his presidency,
26100	30500	and the Commission's report was immediately deleted from the White House website.
30500	36000	This short-lived patriotic education report was intended to summarize, quote,
36000	41300	"...the principles of the American founding and how those principles have shaped our country."
41300	43300	The introduction to the report states,
43300	49500	"...the President's Advisory 1776 Commission presents this first report with the intention of cultivating
49500	53900	a better education among Americans in the principles and history of our nation,
53900	58600	and in the hope that a rediscovery of those principles and the forms of constitutional government
58600	61000	will lead to a more perfect union."
61000	67200	In the couple of days before it was deleted, this report was widely criticized and, well, laughed at
67200	70600	by a variety of historians and academics.
70600	76200	Because as an academic work of history, this report is very silly indeed.
76200	82400	Firstly, the Commission's 18 members included zero professional historians of United States history,
82400	88700	but did find space for former Trump staffers, conservative politicians, and Charlie Kirk.
88700	94200	It's not clear who wrote what parts of the report, it has no listed author or authors,
94200	98500	there's no bibliography, there are no citations for any of its claims.
98500	103900	Some folks on Twitter ran the report through the Turnitin website, a service for detecting plagiarism,
103900	108100	and found that whole sections of the report were simply copied from other places,
108100	111700	largely from previous works by members of the committee.
111700	115200	The report has a very last-minute feel to it in general,
115200	121000	and it seems as though the committee was rushing to get anything at all out the door before Trump's term was up.
121000	127000	It's very short overall, but still manages to fill a lot of space with pictures and lengthy quotations,
127000	132200	and several pages are simply a reprint of the Declaration of Independence in its entirety.
132200	139100	Any college student who's ever had to pad a thin essay to hit a page count will recognize what's going on here.
139100	142600	Various historical facts in the report are incorrect.
142600	147500	Widely criticized, for instance, was its claim that by the end of his life George Washington, quote,
147500	152500	freed all the slaves in his family estate, which is not really true.
152500	159300	As well as the historical, uh, inaccuracies, the report omits enormous parts of American history.
159300	163300	For instance, Native Americans are simply not mentioned at all,
163300	167300	except, of course, for in the fully quoted Declaration of Independence,
167300	171300	which refers to them as, quote, the merciless Indian savages.
171300	177300	It does speak of Americans carving communities out of a vast, untamed wilderness, though,
177300	181300	with zero mention of the people who were already there.
181300	187300	Commenting on the publication of the report, the Association of University Press has described it as being, quote,
187300	193300	plagued by procedural deficiencies that would render it unpublishable as a serious work of scholarship.
193300	199300	It omits citations to any authority, fails to credit or note permissions for its reused content or images,
199300	203300	and was produced without sufficient time for adequate peer review.
203300	210300	So, as a work of history, as an academic work, this is all fairly laughable on the surface.
210300	215300	Especially as a presidentially ordered report published on the White House website.
215300	222300	As a comparison, if we take a look at, say, former President Clinton's One America Initiative report on race relations,
222300	229300	published in 1997, we see that that is much longer, it contains many citations, graphs of relevant data,
229300	233300	and so on. It is a much more rigorous academic work.
233300	242300	So, we could simply let the 1776 report pass into history as a funny footnote at the end of Trump's term in office.
242300	246300	Or his first term in office, if we live in the bad timeline.
246300	249300	But I think we'd be missing an opportunity if we did that.
249300	256300	If we simply dismiss it as a poor academic work, we run the risk of missing that it was not intended to be a good academic work.
256300	262300	The 1776 report was not written to impress or convince a bunch of historians and academic types.
262300	269300	The authors of this report don't care if a bunch of snooty college professors look down at them for not having proper footnotes,
269300	272300	or getting basic historical facts wrong.
272300	276300	This wasn't written for them. This was written for an entirely different audience.
276300	281300	Allow me to go briefly off track here and offer a hopefully relevant anecdote.
281300	287300	So, when I was in high school, I was lucky enough, or unlucky enough, depending on your point of view,
287300	292300	to witness an actual real-life creationism versus evolution debate.
292300	297300	So how this came about was that an exchange teacher who was a rather staunch religious type,
297300	303300	somehow talked my school into allowing him to debate one of the science teachers on the issue of creationism.
303300	306300	And the format was that he would talk for a time and then take questions,
306300	310300	and then the science teacher would talk for a time and then take questions.
310300	315300	Now, in lieu of photographs of these two people, I'm going to be using pictures of two Simpsons characters
315300	318300	who they kinda had the same vibe as, right?
318300	325300	So, the creationist exchange teacher was very passionate about creationism and argued for it effectively.
325300	330300	He was confident in what he said, he used simple language and relatable metaphors,
330300	337300	he smartly avoided preaching his religion too heavily and instead stuck to trying to poke holes in the theory of evolution.
337300	345300	He gave some basic criticisms of evolution and followed up with some basic creationist responses to common arguments for evolution.
345300	352300	His arguments were targeted to his audience, easy to understand, and entirely, completely wrong.
352300	357300	I mean, any halfway intelligent adult could have pointed out the lie in everything he was saying,
357300	362300	except he wasn't talking to halfway intelligent adults, was he?
362300	368300	He was talking to a group of teenage boys who weren't equipped to challenge him on what he was saying.
368300	375300	And his position of authority over that group of teenage boys as their teacher gave an extra weight to what he was saying.
375300	380300	The science teacher, on the other hand, gave out a printed list of facts about evolution
380300	383300	and then proceeded to read them out, boringly.
383300	386300	Now, I don't really blame her for this.
386300	391300	It's not her job to debate whichever weirdo turned up at the school that day looking for an argument.
391300	399300	I got the feeling she simply drew the short straw on who was gonna have to miss a break period in order to debate the creationist.
399300	402300	So we can forgive her low energy to some extent here.
402300	408300	Of course, all the facts on the list she handed out were true, but she wasn't selling them to the audience.
408300	412300	And the creationist had already provided counterarguments for many of them.
412300	415300	She was simply arguing for evolution.
415300	421300	But the creationist was arguing for creationism and against evolution, if you follow.
421300	423300	He wasn't just arguing for his side.
423300	429300	He was trying to define, in the minds of the audience, the form of the larger argument in question.
429300	435300	Much more important than who was technically correct on the facts, which weren't being checked in the moment anyway,
435300	441300	was who could better frame the discussion and then tell the more engaging story within that space.
441300	448300	He wasn't just handing out facts, he was pitching a narrative, one in which a bunch of egghead evolutionist types are,
448300	455300	far from being smart and clever and better than you, actually very silly and easy to trip up with these very simple arguments,
455300	457300	which I'm now going to teach you.
457300	465300	And of course, even if the science teacher had matched the creationist for enthusiasm and rhetorical skill to the actual children in the audience,
465300	469300	the impression would be, well, I guess people disagree about this issue.
469300	474300	It looks like it's still up for debate, which would be a win for the creationist.
474300	481300	The fact that the debate existed at all and was framed as a debate gave the creationist arguments an undue level of respect.
481300	484300	He won once he got the platform to spread his ideas.
484300	490300	The fact that the science teacher didn't properly challenge those ideas was simply the icing on the cake.
490300	494300	So I want to talk about this idea of narrative framing today.
494300	499300	I want to examine the 1776 report as a work of rhetoric, which is what it is.
499300	505300	It is an attempt to persuade, to argue for a particular version of American history.
505300	510300	And it's a version of American history where the facts aren't all that important.
510300	514300	The authors of this report are trying to argue for their version of history.
514300	517300	They're not trying to prove it true.
517300	521300	And that's a subtle distinction, granted, but it's an important one.
521300	527300	Now, of course, the 1776 Commission was dissolved and their report was quickly discredited academically and deleted,
527300	534300	but the version of history it's trying to sell and the motivations behind its doing so sadly haven't gone anywhere.
534300	538300	So we're gonna take a quick read through the report today and see the story it's telling
538300	541300	and the rhetorical tricks it uses to argue its case.
541300	546300	Before we get to that, though, we need to start off by talking about the 1619 Project,
546300	553300	because the 1776 Report is, in many ways, even in name, a response to the 1619 Project.
553300	556300	And to quote the introduction to the project itself,
556300	563300	the 1619 Project is an ongoing initiative from the New York Times Magazine that began in August 2019,
563300	567300	the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery.
567300	572300	It aims to reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery
572300	577300	and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.
577300	582300	So this, too, is self-admittedly an attempt to frame history in a particular way.
582300	589300	It's a response to those versions of history that leave out the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans.
589300	595300	The introductory essay to the project is written by journalist Nicole Hannah-Jones and titled
595300	599300	America Wasn't a Democracy Until Black Americans Made It One.
599300	601300	And this essay opens with the quote,
601300	608300	Are democracies founding ideals were false when they were written? Black Americans have fought to make them true.
608300	614300	And the essay goes on to argue that when the American founders talked about freedom and equality and all that,
614300	620300	it wasn't really true, in large part because they were slave owners living in a slave trading society.
620300	627300	And it goes on to highlight the role that black Americans have played in bringing America closer to those ideals.
627300	630300	Other articles in the project are titled things like
630300	635300	What the Reactionary Politics of 2019 Owe to the Politics of Slavery,
635300	640300	and Why American Prisons Owe Their Cruelty to Slavery, and so on.
640300	646300	It's directly tying modern problems in American society to its history of slavery.
646300	650300	Now, if you want my opinion, well, it's my video, isn't it?
650300	656300	I find the main idea behind the 1619 project to be vitally important and sorely needed,
656300	663300	but the actual project itself is, in a few ways, kind of disappointing, which is unfortunate.
663300	668300	Firstly, it's marred by a rather overstated case in one instance in particular.
668300	672300	Nicole Hannah-Jones' opening essay was published with the claim that
672300	677300	one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain
677300	681300	was that they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.
681300	684300	Now, this makes it sound like the American colonists, as a group,
684300	690300	all decided to declare their independence from Britain so they could keep the slave trade, which is not true.
690300	695300	Now, as far as I'm aware, the British did at one point increase support for the revolutionary cause
695300	702300	in certain areas of the colonies by offering to free slaves who crossed the lines and fought for the British.
702300	707300	And an early draft of the Declaration of Independence even sees Jefferson complaining about this very offer.
707300	713300	But it's a stretch to imply that this was a primary reason for revolt among the colonists in general.
713300	717300	And this is something with which the New York Times eventually agreed,
717300	724300	amending the quote to say that protecting slavery was a primary motivation for some of the colonists.
724300	728300	Now, this was a clarification that really shouldn't have had to have been made.
728300	732300	Historian Leslie M. Harris wrote an article in Politico titled
732300	737300	I Helped Fact Check the 1619 Project, The Times Ignored Me,
737300	741300	in which she claims that she disputed the overstated claim in question,
741300	744300	but that the New York Times went ahead and published it anyway.
744300	746300	And to quote that article briefly,
762300	767300	So far, that's exactly what has happened.
767300	771300	And that's an interesting article, so I'll leave a link to that below if you want to check it out.
771300	774300	So that's rather unfortunate, isn't it?
774300	779300	Aside from that, allow me to briefly poke a false dichotomy here and bring up class.
779300	784300	And I say false dichotomy because sadly, in certain circles of the internet,
784300	790300	any mention of class during a discussion of race will see a few accusations of class reductionism thrown around.
791300	797300	And indeed, any mention of race during a discussion of class will see a few accusations of race reductionism thrown around.
797300	800300	And the answer to this has always been, and always will be,
800300	805300	that both issues are inextricably interlinked and need to be both given time and understood together.
805300	809300	Now, most people understand that idea, I trust.
809300	816300	So, with that in mind, America wasn't a democracy until black Americans made it one.
816300	822300	Now, this implies America wasn't a democracy at some point in the past, but it is now.
822300	824300	But is it really?
824300	829300	You know, it wasn't when black people and other groups were entirely prohibited from participation, of course,
829300	835300	but if we're using people's inability to participate in democracy to declare America to not be a democracy,
835300	837300	then it still isn't today.
837300	841300	Many people still can't participate, and even for those who can,
841300	849300	their level of participation in the political process is dictated directly by their wealth and position within the economic system.
849300	855300	Black people have the right to vote, which is great, but there are a hundred ways that vote can be stolen from them.
855300	861300	Perfectly legally, too, with gerrymandering, various forms of voter suppression,
861300	865300	the enormous amount of money influencing politics, and so on.
865300	870300	The problem is that the principles of democracy run counter to the principles of capitalism.
871300	876300	And this is the main reason I personally find the 1619 Project to be rather disappointing.
876300	881300	When it comes time to criticize capitalism, it doesn't go far enough.
881300	884300	Another essay in the 1619 Project is titled,
884300	888300	American Capitalism is Brutal, You Can Trace That to the Plantation.
888300	893300	And that essay does as it says, it looks at modern economic inequality and injustices,
893300	898300	and finds roots or comparisons for those things in the practices of the slave trade.
898300	903300	The essay highlights that it wasn't only racism motivating the actions of the slave owners,
903300	907300	there were systemic financial incentives for a lot of what they were doing.
907300	910300	So this all sounds fine on the surface, right?
910300	915300	The problem for me is that the essay pulls up short of really condemning capitalism.
915300	921300	American capitalism is called a racist capitalism, or low-road capitalism,
921300	927300	and is compared unfavorably to other capitalist countries that have better workers' rights,
927300	930300	higher wages, more union representation, and so on.
930300	935300	And this is just taking too narrow a view of capitalism, in my opinion.
935300	939300	It implies that what needs to happen is for America to cast off its racism
939300	945300	and take the high road in capitalism, ensuring workers get better rights and higher wages and all that.
945300	949300	Which, fair enough, it does. That does need to happen.
949300	953300	But that won't solve the issues at the heart of capitalism.
953300	958300	You can make things temporarily and locally nicer under capitalism.
958300	964300	There are capitalist countries, as the essay points out, with better workers' rights than America,
964300	966300	but they're not operating in a vacuum.
966300	971300	They're part of a global capitalist system, and whatever rights they've secured within their own borders,
971300	978300	they're still benefiting from being part of an exploitative system that denies those rights to people in other places.
978300	986300	Unfortunately, I'll have to shelve my lefty gripes about the shortcomings of the 1619 project for the rest of the video.
986300	992300	Because while I might wish that the wider argument taking place was between two groups of non-racists
992300	998300	who only disagree on the issue of capitalism, there is someone else at the table here.
998300	1003300	And annoyingly, their position distorts the boundaries of the conversation somewhat.
1003300	1007300	And because of that, I will concede that whatever my problems with the project,
1007300	1012300	when we consider the traditional way American history was, or still is often taught,
1012300	1017300	you know, comprising mostly of uncritical veneration of a bunch of white slave owners,
1017300	1023300	efforts to re-examine American history to center the impact of slavery are sorely needed, clearly.
1023300	1027300	In an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News last year,
1027300	1033300	then-President Trump brought up the 1619 project when asked about previous statements of his
1033300	1038300	indicating he thinks that schools are teaching students to hate their country.
1038300	1039300	So Wallace asked,
1039300	1044300	"'You said our children are taught in school to hate our country. Where do you see that?'
1044300	1045300	To which Trump replied,
1045300	1054300	"'I just look at... I look at school. I watch, I read, look at the stuff. Now they want to change.'
1054300	1057300	1492. Columbus discovered America.
1057300	1065300	You know, we grew up. You grew up. We all did. We all grew up.
1065300	1070300	That's what we learned. Now they want to make it the 1619 project.
1070300	1076300	They... Where did that come from? What does it represent? I don't even know, so...
1076300	1078300	And Wallace points out,
1079300	1081300	To which Trump responds,
1084300	1086300	Very bizarre statements there.
1086300	1088300	I'm not sure what we can learn from that,
1088300	1092300	apart from the fact that the 1619 project is clearly occupying space
1092300	1096300	in what we can charitably refer to as the president's mind.
1096300	1102300	At a speech on October 6th of last year when Trump was talking about the creation of the 1776 commission,
1102300	1105300	he also discussed the 1619 report,
1105300	1112300	saying it seeks to reframe our nation's history around the idea that the United States is not an exceptional country,
1112300	1113300	but an evil one.
1113300	1119300	And the 1776 report itself also mentions the 1619 report directly,
1119300	1124300	saying the journalists behind it have turned to bitterness and judgment.
1124300	1131300	So this report is very much the conservative rejoinder to the 1619 project's centering of slavery.
1131300	1136300	It's a response to what they see as an undermining of American exceptionalism.
1136300	1140300	The White House press release announcing the release of the report reads as follows,
1148300	1154300	The 1776 commission, comprised of some of America's most distinguished scholars and historians,
1154300	1159300	has released a report presenting a definitive chronicle of the American founding,
1159300	1165300	a powerful description of the effect the principles of the Declaration of Independence have had on this nation's history,
1165300	1171300	and a dispositive rebuttal of reckless re-education attempts that seek to reframe American history
1171300	1177300	around the idea that the United States is not an exceptional country, but an evil one.
1177300	1182300	So that's the same phrase about America being an exceptional country as in Trump's speech there.
1182300	1189300	Now, of course, anyone who points to the principles of America's founders as the source of American exceptionalism
1189300	1192300	opens themselves up to the counterargument,
1192300	1194300	well, what about slavery?
1194300	1200300	You know, it's all well and good for America's founding fathers to talk about freedom and inalienable rights
1200300	1202300	and all men being created equal,
1202300	1205300	but at the same time, they owned humans.
1205300	1210300	They bought and sold and profited from and tortured slaves.
1210300	1214300	And there's really no getting away from this contradiction.
1214300	1221300	After its introduction, the first section of the 1776 report is titled The Meaning of the Declaration,
1221300	1222300	and that states,
1241300	1243300	But they owned slaves.
1243300	1246300	You know, there's no escaping that.
1246300	1250300	Any praise for America's founding principles has to be done in the abstract,
1250300	1254300	while acknowledging that in reality they were selectively applied,
1254300	1260300	and for a great many people living in the United States for a very long time, practically, they were a hypocritical lie.
1260300	1263300	Anyone can talk about freedom and equality,
1263300	1269300	but those words are gonna ring a bit hollow coming from someone who keeps other humans in literal chains.
1269300	1277300	Now, conservatives, such as those behind the 1776 report, don't really like slavery being mentioned in this context.
1277300	1283300	This is where a lot of the talk about kids being taught to hate their country comes from, right?
1283300	1289300	Slavery is evil. The United States did slavery. Therefore, the United States is evil.
1289300	1294300	So to put ourselves in the shoes of the authors of the 1776 report here,
1294300	1296300	how do we deal with this?
1296300	1302300	How do we tell the story of America's founding in a patriotic, celebratory way,
1302300	1306300	without getting bogged down in discussions about the evils of slavery?
1306300	1311300	Well, what we do is, we just don't mention slavery at all.
1311300	1315300	Throughout their introduction and two opening sections concerning the founding of America,
1315300	1320300	there are zero mentions of slavery or the slave trade in the text.
1320300	1327300	They talk about the framers of the Constitution seeking to secure equal natural rights and prevent the re-emergence of tyranny,
1327300	1331300	but equal natural rights for who, though?
1331300	1336300	They mention the people's participation in the political process without mentioning that by people.
1336300	1340300	They do not mean the people, as in the people who lived there.
1340300	1346300	They mean the white people, or more often, just the property-owning white men.
1346300	1355300	If the 1619 Project was a centering of slavery in the American story, this is a de-centering of slavery, to put it mildly.
1355300	1362300	In order to tell a patriotic version of America's founding, slavery is simply excised from the history.
1362300	1367300	In the American exceptionalism version of events, slavery is kicked under the rug.
1367300	1371300	But the authors of the report do have to deal with the slavery issue.
1371300	1375300	They realize they can't get away with not mentioning it at all.
1375300	1379300	So having removed slavery from the history of America's founding,
1379300	1382300	they relegate it to a section of the report titled,
1382300	1385300	Challenges to America's Principles,
1385300	1389300	where it's listed alongside things like fascism and communism.
1389300	1396300	Slavery is thus re-categorized as an antagonizing foreign force to be defeated by America,
1396300	1399300	rather than an inherent part of America.
1400300	1403300	Having cordoned off slavery from the rest of American history,
1403300	1409300	the 1776 report sets about attempting to, well, make excuses for it.
1409300	1412300	And these excuses are very revealing.
1412300	1413300	They lead by saying,
1429300	1432300	than the exception throughout human history.
1432300	1434300	So, this is the first excuse.
1434300	1439300	Slavery was not a uniquely American evil, so slavery is evil to start with.
1439300	1442300	That's good, they got that far at least.
1442300	1444300	But it's not unique to America.
1444300	1447300	Slavery is more the rule than the exception.
1447300	1452300	Or put another way, American slavery was unexceptional.
1452300	1458300	Now this excuse reveals why they had to separate out slavery from the broader history of the American founding,
1458300	1463300	because it blows a massive hole in their argument for American exceptionalism.
1463300	1469300	And this should go without saying really, but if you're trying to argue for America being exceptional,
1469300	1473300	you can't then excuse its flaws by claiming it is unexceptional.
1473300	1476300	That's trying to have it both ways.
1476300	1481300	America's good qualities are used to indicate it is special and unique and exceptional,
1481300	1485300	while its bad qualities are used to indicate nothing.
1485300	1489300	They're merely products of the time, so we can excuse those.
1489300	1493300	The report at one point states all the good things we see around us,
1493300	1498300	from the physical infrastructure, to our high standards of living, to our exceptional freedoms,
1498300	1503300	are direct results of America's unity, stability, and justice.
1503300	1507300	All of which in turn rest on the bedrock of our founding principles.
1507300	1512300	So it's saying the good things, and only the good things that Americans see today,
1512300	1515300	are directly traceable to its founding.
1515300	1520300	But the report announces the 1619 Project for doing what is close to the mirror of this,
1520300	1526300	claiming that many of America's present inequalities and flaws also have roots in its early history.
1526300	1529300	So we have to ask, why is this?
1529300	1535300	Why is it that only America's positive qualities are able to be traced from its history in this way?
1535300	1537300	That's rather convenient, isn't it?
1537300	1542300	The report goes on to highlight certain of the founders anti-slavery sentiments,
1542300	1547300	and casts their compromises with slavery as merely a practical political move.
1547300	1550300	But this is only telling part of the story.
1550300	1557300	We can't defend the founders as a group by saying that certain individuals personally disagreed with slavery
1557300	1561300	and merely compromised with it, because we have to ask, who were they compromising with?
1562300	1568300	They're not arguing with aliens threatening to blow up the Earth unless the United States keeps the slave trade, are they?
1568300	1574300	They were making compromises with other slave owning and slave trade supporting founders.
1574300	1578300	And by compromises here, I mean they made real legal compromises.
1578300	1586300	One provision in the Constitution at the time of its ratification forbade any restriction of the importation of slaves for 20 years.
1586300	1590300	Certain founders disagreed with the slave trade, that is true.
1590300	1594300	But as a group, they not only kept it, they protected it.
1594300	1595300	The report states,
1609300	1615300	What history went on to show was that no durable union could continue to exist with those compromises.
1616300	1622300	Now the authors of the 1776 report might still have a point about this American exceptionalism stuff
1622300	1626300	if America had been unique in its abolition of slavery or the slave trade,
1626300	1630300	or maybe it was particularly early to abolish it or something.
1630300	1631300	But it wasn't, was it?
1631300	1632300	The report says,
1638300	1644300	Then why, we might ask, did the United States take longer to legally outlaw the slave trade and slavery
1644300	1646300	than the tyrannical British Empire?
1646300	1651300	Surely America's exceptional founding principles of freedom and equality
1651300	1656300	should have meant they were able to outlaw slavery before the Empire ruled by a monarch.
1656300	1661300	Rarely there is just no getting around the contradiction at the heart of the American founding.
1661300	1667300	The founders proclaimed freedom and equality, while at the same time keeping other people in slavery.
1667300	1670300	Whatever their individual opinions about the slave trade,
1670300	1677300	whatever the political situation at the time, the sum of their actions led to a continuance of a system of slavery.
1677300	1679300	That's simply the truth.
1679300	1684300	It can't be ignored or excused, and it can't be removed from the story.
1684300	1689300	So let's step back for a second and ask, what is actually the issue here?
1689300	1694300	What's the problem with centering slavery for the authors of the 1776 report?
1694300	1699300	Well, it's to do, I think, with how they view the purpose of historical education.
1700300	1707300	We shouldn't be learning from history in totality, with its moral complexities, its good and bad parts,
1707300	1712300	understanding its participants as humans with human flaws and failings.
1712300	1717300	What we should be doing is looking to history for patriotic and moral instruction,
1717300	1723300	understanding its participants as either heroes to be emulated or villains to be defeated.
1723300	1728300	This is history as parable. We're supposed to be being shown how best to live.
1728300	1735300	And this is why conservatives often conflate discussions of their country's historical crimes with an attack upon history in general.
1735300	1740300	Of course, you might say that if those crimes have gone underreported or unexplored,
1740300	1747300	then bringing them into the spotlight is unarguably broadening the history and deepening our understanding of it.
1747300	1754300	But you'd only say that if you were actually interested in learning from history, instead of looking to it as a source of patriotism.
1754300	1759300	We teach children about our historical role models so that they love their country.
1759300	1765300	By highlighting their crimes or failings, you thus must want children to hate their country.
1765300	1768300	In the section Teaching America, the report states,
1768300	1776300	Educators must convey a sense of enlightened patriotism that equips each generation with a knowledge of America's founding principles,
1776300	1781300	a deep reverence for their liberties, and a profound love of their country.
1781300	1785300	And I'd like to compare that with another quote from later in the same section when they say,
1785300	1792300	States and school districts should reject any curriculum that promotes one-sided partisan opinions,
1792300	1800300	activist propaganda, or factional ideologies that demean America's heritage, dishonor our heroes, or deny our principles.
1800300	1803300	You might think this contradicts, right?
1803300	1811300	Educators should not teach one-sided partisan opinions, but must teach children to be patriotic and love their country.
1811300	1815300	That doesn't make sense, does it? Because those are one-sided opinions.
1815300	1820300	But on closer examination, this is not a contradiction. It's phrased very specifically.
1820300	1831300	Schools should reject any curriculum that promotes one-sided partisan opinions, activist propaganda, or factional ideologies that demean America's heritage.
1831300	1837300	Because, of course, one-sided partisan opinions that celebrate America's heritage, those are fine.
1837300	1844300	What we don't want is biased one-sided opinions saying America is bad, but biased one-sided opinions saying America is good.
1844300	1845300	Well, brilliant.
1845300	1853300	Now, before we move on, I just want to highlight one important thing about this mindset of looking to history as a source of patriotism,
1853300	1857300	and it's that the people who think like this assume others do too.
1857300	1864300	To them, we all think America's supposed greatness is rooted in its founding principles and the characteristics of its founders.
1864300	1869300	It's just that some of us want to use that information for evil.
1869300	1875300	And it's only a short jump from where we're at right now to get into the real conspiracy theorizing.
1875300	1880300	These attempts to undermine and destroy American society by teaching people about history,
1880300	1885300	what if they're not simply the actions of some lone wolf America-hating academic types?
1885300	1888300	What if it's an organized conspiracy?
1888300	1895300	Appendix 3 of the 1776 report is titled Created Equal or Identity Politics,
1895300	1900300	and that contains a subsection titled Intellectual Origins of Identity Politics,
1900300	1904300	and that shares the conspiracy theory that is cultural Marxism.
1904300	1909300	So, cultural Marxism, just quoting Wikipedia here for brevity,
1909300	1918300	is a far-right anti-Semitic conspiracy theory which claims Western Marxism as the basis of continuing academic and intellectual efforts to subvert Western culture.
1918300	1926300	The conspiracists claim that an elite of Marxist theorists and Frankfurt School intellectuals are subverting Western society
1926300	1931300	with a culture war that undermines the Christian values of traditionalist conservatism
1931300	1936300	and promotes decultural liberal values of the 1960s counterculture.
1936300	1941300	And the conspiracy theory is all here in the 1776 report.
1941300	1948300	They name the Frankfurt School, critical theory, intellectuals Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse,
1948300	1951300	the division of society into oppressed and oppressor groups,
1951300	1956300	the creation of a counterculture that seeks to destroy the established culture, and so on.
1956300	1962300	Now, to the uninitiated, this might seem like run-of-the-mill grumpy old man complaining, right?
1962300	1969300	Society is changing in a way that for conservatives, like those behind this report, doesn't make sense.
1969300	1972300	They think America and Americans are exceptional.
1972300	1977300	So when Americans do things they consider unexceptional, or un-American,
1977300	1982300	usually things like wanting a proper healthcare system, this doesn't make sense to them.
1982300	1985300	This couldn't be arising from within our own society.
1985300	1990300	This has to be some sort of organized outside antagonist force.
1990300	1996300	Kids these days are more interested in listening to the rap music than reading the Constitution.
1996300	2001300	Am I so out of touch? No, it's cultural Marxist brainwashing or something.
2001300	2004300	But this is not just idle complaining.
2004300	2009300	This is real far-right Nazi stuff, just with a few euphemisms here and there.
2009300	2014300	One reason that the Wikipedia article there calls this an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory
2014300	2019300	is that often cultural Marxists are criticized simply as a stand-in for Jewish people.
2019300	2026300	And, of course, the Nazi party themselves had their own variant of the cultural Marxist conspiracy theory,
2026300	2028300	which they called cultural Bolshevism.
2028300	2034300	When I read the intellectual origins of identity politics, it brought to mind something else that I'd read before,
2034300	2037300	and that's the historical roots of political correctness,
2037300	2041300	which is another introduction to the cultural Marxist conspiracy theory,
2041300	2045300	and a strikingly similar piece of writing right down to the title.
2046300	2051300	And if we look at the historical roots of political correctness, it's all here again.
2051300	2054300	We've got the Frankfurt School, there's critical theory,
2054300	2059300	Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse, the division of society into oppressed and oppressor groups,
2059300	2063300	the creation of a counterculture, and so on again.
2063300	2067300	This passage is taken from the manifesto written by Anders Behring Breivik,
2067300	2072300	the Norwegian far-right terrorist who killed 77 people in 2011.
2072300	2077300	That manifesto is titled A European Declaration of Independence.
2077300	2080300	Now, this should be worrisome, right?
2080300	2085300	That the White House website is publishing blatant white supremacist propaganda.
2085300	2089300	Usually, it only publishes veiled white supremacist propaganda.
2089300	2091300	And I want to make two points about this.
2091300	2097300	Firstly, this sort of thing is one reason why the more direct academic fact-checking debunking route
2097300	2102300	doesn't hit very hard with the sort of audience which is the target for this rubbish.
2102300	2107300	You know, of course those academics and historians are gonna say the report is wrong on the facts.
2107300	2110300	They're all part of a cultural Marxist conspiracy.
2110300	2119300	Universities in the United States are often today hotbeds of anti-Americanism, libel, and censorship, the report says.
2119300	2126300	We see it anticipates an academic rebuttal, and so pre-defends itself by attempting to discredit the rebuttas
2126300	2128300	by branding them liars.
2128300	2131300	You know, they're just liars. You can't listen to what they say.
2131300	2136300	They're engaged in a conspiracy to destroy Western civilization, after all.
2136300	2140300	They'll say anything, so you can't listen to them. Only listen to me.
2140300	2146300	This is also, of course, part of a broader trend of conservative anti-intellectualism in general,
2146300	2154300	intended to brand academics and experts, you know, people who might know what they're talking about, as merely partisan activists.
2154300	2161300	Their proximity to whichever topic is in question, instead of conveying experience, is used as evidence for bias.
2161300	2170300	And taking this worldview to its logical conclusion, the most trustworthy person is therefore the person who knows least of all, right?
2170300	2174300	But the 1776 report doesn't just treat academics in this manner.
2174300	2179300	I want to move on now and have a think about the way in which the report treats black people.
2179300	2185300	The first essay of the 1619 project is broadly about the lingering effects of slavery and systemic racism
2185300	2189300	and black people's contributions to civil rights over the years and so on,
2189300	2194300	but it's also about how contemporary black people relate to that history, right?
2194300	2200300	The author talks about her own family's experiences living with racism and segregation,
2200300	2204300	and her own relationship to American history and patriotism.
2204300	2209300	And for the 1776 report, this represents a problem.
2209300	2213300	Now, of course, when American history is taught to a group of American children,
2213300	2220300	some of those children are inevitably going to recognize that the history contains people with the same skin color as them,
2220300	2226300	being bought and sold and enslaved for no other reason than having the same skin color as them.
2226300	2231300	Which, of course, means they, as a group, are going to relate to that history differently, right?
2231300	2235300	They're going to have a different understanding to the white majority,
2235300	2240300	who see their own skin color represented by the historical figures who, they're often being taught,
2240300	2244300	were brave and wise and heroic and also owned other people.
2244300	2252300	Which is a whole problem in itself, but regardless, my point is that the different groups are going to relate to the history in different ways.
2252300	2257300	This is, for the authors of the 1776 report, a question of national unity.
2257300	2262300	Because Americans are not supposed to be having different interpretations of America's history,
2262300	2265300	they're all supposed to understand it in the same way.
2265300	2271300	Now, of course, the report acts as if group identities are only ever invented and foisted on people
2271300	2275300	by cultural Marxists and partisan activist academics and so on.
2275300	2279300	They have no understanding of structural systemic racism.
2279300	2285300	For them, racism worthy of being organized against ended in the 1960s with the passing of the Civil Rights Act.
2285300	2287300	But we all know it didn't.
2287300	2293300	You can teach a purely patriotic version of American history to all children equally, whatever their background,
2293300	2298300	but when those children encounter the labor market, or have experiences with the police,
2298300	2302300	or try to buy a house, or any one of a hundred other examples like this,
2302300	2307300	they're going to be treated differently, based in part on those same group distinctions
2307300	2311300	that once branded some people as slaves and not others.
2311300	2317300	However colorblind we pretend society is now that different racial groups are technically legally equal,
2317300	2322300	the status quo sees these group identities and they are treated differently.
2322300	2327300	The divisions in American society are arising from inequalities inside American society,
2327300	2330300	not being injected by some outside force.
2330300	2336300	We see here the other side of the coin to the antisemitism of the Cultural Marxist Conspiracy Theory,
2336300	2340300	because it requires not just imagined Jewish manipulators,
2340300	2346300	but also an American black population that is incapable of properly identifying shared injustices.
2346300	2353300	It betrays a tremendous mistrust of black people to dismiss their reactions to their own experiences
2353300	2356300	as mere inventions of outside agitators.
2356300	2366300	Anyway, all that aside, how does the 1776 report, with its singular, pointedly not open to interpretation version of American history,
2366300	2368300	deal with black people?
2368300	2376300	Because as the 1619 report highlights, black people have often been at the forefront of pushes for social change in the United States,
2376300	2380300	and thus have often been some of the most vocal critics of America's failings.
2380300	2384300	And the report deals with this by playing a rhetorical trick.
2384300	2388300	Let's first talk about their presentation of Martin Luther King Jr.
2388300	2393300	They include pictures of King, of course, nice big space-filling pictures,
2393300	2398300	but they also quote him, such as here when they include an excerpt from his I Have a Dream speech
2398300	2404300	in which King praises the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
2404300	2408300	And they quote this passage again in the section titled Racism and Identity Politics
2408300	2412300	when talking about the reforms brought about by the Civil Rights Movement.
2412300	2414300	But all is not well.
2414300	2422300	It seemed, finally, that America's nearly two-century effort to realize fully the principles of the Declaration had reached a culmination.
2422300	2428300	But the heady spirit of the original Civil Rights Movement, whose leaders forcefully quoted the Declaration of Independence,
2428300	2433300	the Constitution, and the rhetoric of the founders and of Lincoln, proved to be short-lived.
2433300	2439300	The Civil Rights Movement was almost immediately turned to programs that ran counter to the lofty ideals of the founders.
2439300	2443300	The ideas that drove this change had been growing in America for decades,
2443300	2446300	and they distorted many areas of policy in the half-century that followed.
2446300	2453300	Among the distortions was the abandonment of non-discrimination and equal opportunity in favor of group rights,
2453300	2455300	not unlike those advanced by Calhoun.
2455300	2463300	That's John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President of the United States and vocal supporter of slavery there, and his followers.
2463300	2470300	The justification for reversing the promise of colorblind civil rights was that past discrimination requires present effort,
2470300	2477300	or affirmative action in the form of preferential treatment to overcome longer crude inequalities.
2477300	2484300	And all this means that identity politics makes it less likely that racial reconciliation and healing can be attained
2484300	2489300	by pursuing Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream for America.
2489300	2496300	So, oh no, Civil Rights Movement, you were doing so well, weren't you? But then you went and took it too far.
2496300	2503300	How can we attain Martin Luther King's dream for America if you go off pushing for wacky ideas like affirmative action?
2503300	2508300	Certainly, Martin Luther King wouldn't have supported that, right?
2508300	2513300	However, a year after his I Have a Dream speech, King wrote the following.
2513300	2519300	Whenever this issue of compensatory or preferential treatment for the Negro is raised, some of our friends recoil in horror.
2519300	2524300	The Negro should be granted equality, they agree, but he should ask for nothing more.
2524300	2528300	On the surface, this appears reasonable, but it is not realistic.
2528300	2534300	For it is obvious that if a man enters the starting line of a race 300 years after another man,
2534300	2537300	the first would have to perform some incredible feat in order to catch up.
2537300	2539300	King is elsewhere quoted as saying,
2547300	2551300	And in 1965, King was interviewed by writer Alex Haley,
2551300	2556300	who, referring to King's support for a jobs program for young black people, asked him,
2567300	2572300	Indeed. Can any fair-minded citizen deny that the Negro has been deprived?
2572300	2576300	Few people reflect that for two centuries the Negro was enslaved and robbed of any wages,
2576300	2580300	potential accrued wealth which would have been the legacy of his descendants.
2580300	2587300	All of America's wealth today could not adequately compensate its Negroes for his centuries of exploitation and humiliation.
2587300	2595300	It is an economic fact that a program such as I propose would certainly cost far less than any computation of two centuries of unpaid wages,
2595300	2597300	plus accumulated interest.
2597300	2600300	So, what's going on here then?
2600300	2608300	The authors of the 1776 report appear to be misrepresenting Martin Luther King Jr.'s opinions,
2608300	2610300	if you can believe such a thing.
2610300	2618300	Now, I'd like to make clear here that I have not caught the authors of the 1776 report making an unwitting mistake here.
2618300	2622300	They know exactly who King was and what his opinions were.
2623300	2628300	They know he supported affirmative action, they know he was a vocal critic of capitalism,
2628300	2635300	they know he supported a radical redistribution of economic power, and they hate him for that.
2635300	2637300	They absolutely despise the man.
2637300	2643300	But conservatives also know that King is today a broadly popular and beloved figure.
2643300	2648300	So, a frontal assault, the kind to which they would subject King if he were alive today,
2648300	2653300	you know, calling him a traitorous communist cultural Marxist and all that, would backfire.
2653300	2658300	So, the conservative tactic with regards to King is one of selective quotation.
2658300	2664300	They overemphasize a single line from one of his speeches and then they pretend that's all he ever said.
2664300	2668300	If you got all your information about Martin Luther King Jr. from this report,
2668300	2675300	you'd think he popped into existence in 1963 to say racism sure is bad and then he just fell off the earth or something.
2675300	2680300	Now, the aim of this tactic is twofold. Firstly, it defangs King, right?
2680300	2687300	It makes him into a simplistic storybook character who just quotes the founding fathers and says it's bad to be racist,
2687300	2689300	and that's all he does.
2689300	2696300	But the other aim here is to use this strawman version of King as a standard against which other black people can be judged negatively.
2696300	2702300	The point of praising King before going on to criticize, for instance, those who support affirmative action programs,
2702300	2707300	is to give the impression that King would not support affirmative action programs.
2707300	2712300	Of course, the real Martin Luther King Jr. did support affirmative action programs, but that doesn't matter.
2712300	2717300	We're not talking about him. We're talking about storybook Martin Luther King Jr.,
2717300	2720300	and he wouldn't support affirmative action programs.
2720300	2726300	He would quote the founding fathers and say it was bad to be racist, and that's all he would do.
2726300	2735300	This is not a tactic invented by the 1776 reports I'd like to make clear, lest I give the impression they're somehow being inventive in their lies.
2735300	2741300	This is an old conservative tactic for dealing with the radical activist Martin Luther King Jr.
2741300	2749300	who talked about economic equality and criticized American imperialism and was arrested and jailed for his opinions.
2749300	2754300	They just make a new Martin Luther King Jr. at the head of a toothless civil rights movement
2754300	2759300	which saw as its final goal legal equality, but demanded nothing further.
2759300	2765300	Martin Luther King Jr. is not the only black person in the 1776 report to get this treatment.
2765300	2773300	They also quote Frederick Douglass. They close out the main text of the report with a quote from Frederick Douglass, actually, and that reads as follows.
2773300	2779300	The Declaration of Independence is the ring bolt to the chain of your nation's destiny, so indeed I regard it.
2779300	2783300	The principles contained in that instrument are saving principles.
2783300	2789300	Stand by those principles, be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost.
2789300	2796300	So that's another black social reformer singing the praises of the Declaration of Independence completely out of context.
2796300	2799300	No further analysis needed, right?
2799300	2802300	Frederick Douglass said the Declaration of Independence was good.
2804300	2806300	That's it. That's the end of the point.
2806300	2812300	But allow me to quote from the same speech as the 1776 report pulled that quote from.
2812300	2818300	So this is an abridged version of a speech by Douglass titled, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July.
2818300	2823300	Now, I'm not going to be able to do this justice, obviously, but here we go.
2823300	2829300	So, after praising the Declaration of Independence and its principles, Douglass goes on to say,
2830300	2835300	Fellow citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today?
2835300	2839300	What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence?
2839300	2847300	Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice embodied in that Declaration of Independence extended to us?
2847300	2852300	Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions?
2852300	2858300	But such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us.
2858300	2862300	I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary.
2862300	2866300	Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us.
2866300	2870300	The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common.
2870300	2879300	The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you, not by me.
2879300	2883300	This Fourth of July is yours, not mine.
2883300	2887300	I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from the slave's point of view.
2887300	2892300	Standing there, identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine,
2892300	2900300	I do not hesitate to declare with all my soul that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this Fourth of July.
2900300	2908300	Whether we turn to the declarations of the past or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting.
2908300	2914300	America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future.
2914300	2917300	What to the American slave is your Fourth of July?
2917300	2925300	I answer, a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.
2925300	2933300	To him, your celebration is a sham, your boasted liberty an unholy license, your national greatness, swelling vanity,
2933300	2940300	your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless, your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fronted impudence,
2940300	2946300	your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery, your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings,
2946300	2953300	with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him me a bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy,
2953300	2958300	a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.
2958300	2966300	There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour.
2967300	2973300	Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world,
2973300	2981300	travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation,
2981300	2988300	and you will say with me that for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.
2988300	2993300	Fellow citizens, I will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies.
2993300	3002300	The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretense, and your Christianity as a lie.
3003300	3007300	Cor blimey, he really gave it to them, didn't he?
3007300	3015300	So, what's my point here? Well, though it was set up to counter the claim that the United States is not an exceptional country, but an evil one,
3015300	3026300	the 1776 report closes out with a quote from a speech in which the speaker very forcefully and repeatedly declares the United States to be the most evil place in the whole world.
3026300	3028300	Which is rather funny, isn't it?
3028300	3031300	But again, this is not a mistake.
3031300	3042300	Both King and Douglas praised America's founding principles, but then went on to say that America was betraying those principles, not living up to them, proving them to be practically lies.
3042300	3047300	The 1776 report snips off the criticism and presents only the praise.
3047300	3056300	Now, we could do the same thing to the 1619 report, which also praises America's principles prior to criticizing it for not living up to them.
3056300	3059300	For instance, here's a quote taken out of context here.
3059300	3067300	In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson sat at his portable writing desk in a rented room in Philadelphia and penned these words.
3067300	3079300	We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
3079300	3091300	For the last 243 years, this fierce assertion of the fundamental and natural rights of humankind to freedom and self-governance has defined our global reputation as a land of liberty.
3091300	3092300	So, there we go.
3092300	3101300	Stripped of all context, of all the following criticism, of the accusation that while these ideals are noble in spirit, they are not being delivered upon,
3101300	3108300	stripped of that, these words now appear only as mindless celebration of the United States and its founding principles.
3108300	3112300	This is precisely what was done to the speeches of King and Douglas.
3112300	3121300	It turns out that what conservatives like those behind the 1776 report most appreciate about figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglas
3121300	3127300	is that they're dead, and cannot defend themselves when their words and ideas are misappropriated.
3127300	3135300	In life, they criticized America, but they're dead now, and therefore they can't correct us when we cherry-pick lines out of their speeches.
3135300	3142300	So, we thus make them safe. We reduce them to being only reciters of white men's words.
3142300	3150300	Now, the authors of the 1619 Project are alive, and their arguments are contemporary. Their criticisms must be met.
3150300	3161300	The authors of the 1776 report cannot disagree that the institution of slavery was evil and unacceptable and counter to America's supposed ideals, which is all true,
3161300	3168300	but they cannot accept this criticism because of where it's coming from. Because it's coming from black people.
3168300	3176300	To the authors of this report, America's crimes, if they are to be acknowledged at all, are to be acknowledged by white men.
3176300	3181300	When the time comes, not pointed out by black people, speaking out of turn.
3181300	3185300	What matters here is white control of the conversation.
3185300	3194300	If living black people criticize America, we compare them unfavorably to the mythological cartoon version of figures like King and Douglas,
3194300	3200300	the respectable black people who we say did it right, after we've given them a whitewashing, that is.
3200300	3209300	By picking and choosing which black people have legitimate things to say, and who are merely ideological, motivated partisan activists,
3209300	3213300	we're making the claim that it is the right of white people to decide this.
3213300	3221300	American history is a white man's story. We insist black people can observe and mouth along with the words if they like,
3221300	3226300	but they are not allowed to complain, and they're certainly not allowed to direct.
3226300	3235300	After they die, we may graciously acknowledge that they had some part in the story, but only because they were inspired by the ideas of white men.
3235300	3242300	Now, of course, the big win for the 1776 report is that they got this rubbish published at all.
3242300	3248300	Trump gave them a platform to share their racist conspiracy nonsense, and they used it.
3248300	3255300	Their report was quickly discredited and deleted, but it will always have been published on the White House website,
3255300	3259300	and that gives their arguments a seriously undue legitimacy.
3259300	3268300	The report was quickly deleted, sure, but that it existed at all means its particular brand of patriotic education can serve as a blueprint.
3268300	3275300	Texas lawmaker unveils plans for 1836 project to commemorate state's independence from Mexico.
3275300	3283300	A Texas lawmaker has unveiled plans for a committee that would promote patriotic education across the state's schools, parks, and museums.
3283300	3292300	Rep. Tan Parker is pressing for the 1836 project, named after the year Texas achieved independence from Mexico,
3292300	3294300	according to legislation filed Monday.
3295300	3297300	The lawmaker said in a news release,
3310300	3320300	Now, I feel some sympathy with all you Americans on this one, as over here in the UK, we've recently dialed up our own particular brand of patriotic nonsense.
3320300	3326300	Our revered historical figure who must not be insulted is Winston Churchill, the man who, as we all know,
3326300	3335300	single-handedly defeated the entire military force of Nazi Germany and definitely wasn't a eugenicist and open white supremacist, oh no.
3335300	3346300	Criticisms of Churchill or the various crimes of the British Empire are met by conservatives over here in much the same way that criticisms of the American founders are met over there.
3346300	3354300	Now, I'd like not to worry about all this and see it merely as the last desperate flailings of an increasingly irrelevant conservative mindset,
3354300	3363300	just trying to pass itself on to the next generation, as people of the previous generations increasingly, well, do what all people do.
3363300	3368300	Unfortunately, I don't think that this is something that's just gonna go away by itself.
3368300	3377300	All this patriotism, nationalism, racism, and so on isn't just a generational thing, nor does it stem solely from individual flaws.
3377300	3380300	It serves an economic purpose, too.
3380300	3389300	If you're a capitalist, you want your workers to see immigrants and foreigners as competition, not as fellow workers, which is what they are.
3389300	3394300	If you can't keep people divided and unequal, they'll unite and demand equality.
3394300	3400300	So, as long as there's profit in keeping people divided, attempts to divide people will persist.
3400300	3403300	So, this stuff has to be met actively.
3403300	3407300	You can't just wait for your parents to die.
3407300	3411300	That was the point of this video, I suppose. There we go, we found it.
3411300	3413300	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
3413300	3420300	And as always, thank you especially to all my lovely supporters over on Patreon, some of whom should be scrolling by right now.
3420300	3429300	As always, patrons get early access to rough versions of my new videos with various mistakes in which they very helpfully point out and make fun of me for.
3429300	3433300	And I'll leave a link to my Patreon page below if you would like to check that out.
3433300	3437300	Alright, that's all from me today, folks. I'll see you next time.
