00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about former President Trump's 1776 Commission,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,700
which he set up to promote what he called patriotic education.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:19,600
The 1776 Commission released the 1776 Report on the 18th of January, just two days before Trump left office.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,100
Incoming President Joe Biden dissolved the 1776 Commission on the first day of his presidency,

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,500
and the Commission's report was immediately deleted from the White House website.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,000
This short-lived patriotic education report was intended to summarize, quote,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,300
"...the principles of the American founding and how those principles have shaped our country."

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
The introduction to the report states,

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,500
"...the President's Advisory 1776 Commission presents this first report with the intention of cultivating

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,900
a better education among Americans in the principles and history of our nation,

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,600
and in the hope that a rediscovery of those principles and the forms of constitutional government

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,000
will lead to a more perfect union."

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,200
In the couple of days before it was deleted, this report was widely criticized and, well, laughed at

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,600
by a variety of historians and academics.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,200
Because as an academic work of history, this report is very silly indeed.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Firstly, the Commission's 18 members included zero professional historians of United States history,

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,700
but did find space for former Trump staffers, conservative politicians, and Charlie Kirk.

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,200
It's not clear who wrote what parts of the report, it has no listed author or authors,

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,500
there's no bibliography, there are no citations for any of its claims.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,900
Some folks on Twitter ran the report through the Turnitin website, a service for detecting plagiarism,

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,100
and found that whole sections of the report were simply copied from other places,

22
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,700
largely from previous works by members of the committee.

23
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,200
The report has a very last-minute feel to it in general,

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,000
and it seems as though the committee was rushing to get anything at all out the door before Trump's term was up.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's very short overall, but still manages to fill a lot of space with pictures and lengthy quotations,

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,200
and several pages are simply a reprint of the Declaration of Independence in its entirety.

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:19,100
Any college student who's ever had to pad a thin essay to hit a page count will recognize what's going on here.

28
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,600
Various historical facts in the report are incorrect.

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,500
Widely criticized, for instance, was its claim that by the end of his life George Washington, quote,

30
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,500
freed all the slaves in his family estate, which is not really true.

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,300
As well as the historical, uh, inaccuracies, the report omits enormous parts of American history.

32
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,300
For instance, Native Americans are simply not mentioned at all,

33
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,300
except, of course, for in the fully quoted Declaration of Independence,

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,300
which refers to them as, quote, the merciless Indian savages.

35
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,300
It does speak of Americans carving communities out of a vast, untamed wilderness, though,

36
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,300
with zero mention of the people who were already there.

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,300
Commenting on the publication of the report, the Association of University Press has described it as being, quote,

38
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:13,300
plagued by procedural deficiencies that would render it unpublishable as a serious work of scholarship.

39
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,300
It omits citations to any authority, fails to credit or note permissions for its reused content or images,

40
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,300
and was produced without sufficient time for adequate peer review.

41
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,300
So, as a work of history, as an academic work, this is all fairly laughable on the surface.

42
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,300
Especially as a presidentially ordered report published on the White House website.

43
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,300
As a comparison, if we take a look at, say, former President Clinton's One America Initiative report on race relations,

44
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,300
published in 1997, we see that that is much longer, it contains many citations, graphs of relevant data,

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,300
and so on. It is a much more rigorous academic work.

46
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:02,300
So, we could simply let the 1776 report pass into history as a funny footnote at the end of Trump's term in office.

47
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,300
Or his first term in office, if we live in the bad timeline.

48
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,300
But I think we'd be missing an opportunity if we did that.

49
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,300
If we simply dismiss it as a poor academic work, we run the risk of missing that it was not intended to be a good academic work.

50
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,300
The 1776 report was not written to impress or convince a bunch of historians and academic types.

51
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:29,300
The authors of this report don't care if a bunch of snooty college professors look down at them for not having proper footnotes,

52
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,300
or getting basic historical facts wrong.

53
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,300
This wasn't written for them. This was written for an entirely different audience.

54
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Allow me to go briefly off track here and offer a hopefully relevant anecdote.

55
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,300
So, when I was in high school, I was lucky enough, or unlucky enough, depending on your point of view,

56
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,300
to witness an actual real-life creationism versus evolution debate.

57
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,300
So how this came about was that an exchange teacher who was a rather staunch religious type,

58
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,300
somehow talked my school into allowing him to debate one of the science teachers on the issue of creationism.

59
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
And the format was that he would talk for a time and then take questions,

60
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,300
and then the science teacher would talk for a time and then take questions.

61
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Now, in lieu of photographs of these two people, I'm going to be using pictures of two Simpsons characters

62
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,300
who they kinda had the same vibe as, right?

63
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:25,300
So, the creationist exchange teacher was very passionate about creationism and argued for it effectively.

64
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,300
He was confident in what he said, he used simple language and relatable metaphors,

65
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,300
he smartly avoided preaching his religion too heavily and instead stuck to trying to poke holes in the theory of evolution.

66
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:45,300
He gave some basic criticisms of evolution and followed up with some basic creationist responses to common arguments for evolution.

67
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,300
His arguments were targeted to his audience, easy to understand, and entirely, completely wrong.

68
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,300
I mean, any halfway intelligent adult could have pointed out the lie in everything he was saying,

69
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,300
except he wasn't talking to halfway intelligent adults, was he?

70
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,300
He was talking to a group of teenage boys who weren't equipped to challenge him on what he was saying.

71
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:15,300
And his position of authority over that group of teenage boys as their teacher gave an extra weight to what he was saying.

72
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,300
The science teacher, on the other hand, gave out a printed list of facts about evolution

73
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,300
and then proceeded to read them out, boringly.

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Now, I don't really blame her for this.

75
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,300
It's not her job to debate whichever weirdo turned up at the school that day looking for an argument.

76
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:39,300
I got the feeling she simply drew the short straw on who was gonna have to miss a break period in order to debate the creationist.

77
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,300
So we can forgive her low energy to some extent here.

78
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Of course, all the facts on the list she handed out were true, but she wasn't selling them to the audience.

79
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,300
And the creationist had already provided counterarguments for many of them.

80
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,300
She was simply arguing for evolution.

81
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,300
But the creationist was arguing for creationism and against evolution, if you follow.

82
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
He wasn't just arguing for his side.

83
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,300
He was trying to define, in the minds of the audience, the form of the larger argument in question.

84
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,300
Much more important than who was technically correct on the facts, which weren't being checked in the moment anyway,

85
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,300
was who could better frame the discussion and then tell the more engaging story within that space.

86
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:28,300
He wasn't just handing out facts, he was pitching a narrative, one in which a bunch of egghead evolutionist types are,

87
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:35,300
far from being smart and clever and better than you, actually very silly and easy to trip up with these very simple arguments,

88
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
which I'm now going to teach you.

89
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:45,300
And of course, even if the science teacher had matched the creationist for enthusiasm and rhetorical skill to the actual children in the audience,

90
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,300
the impression would be, well, I guess people disagree about this issue.

91
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,300
It looks like it's still up for debate, which would be a win for the creationist.

92
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:01,300
The fact that the debate existed at all and was framed as a debate gave the creationist arguments an undue level of respect.

93
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,300
He won once he got the platform to spread his ideas.

94
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,300
The fact that the science teacher didn't properly challenge those ideas was simply the icing on the cake.

95
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,300
So I want to talk about this idea of narrative framing today.

96
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,300
I want to examine the 1776 report as a work of rhetoric, which is what it is.

97
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,300
It is an attempt to persuade, to argue for a particular version of American history.

98
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,300
And it's a version of American history where the facts aren't all that important.

99
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,300
The authors of this report are trying to argue for their version of history.

100
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,300
They're not trying to prove it true.

101
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,300
And that's a subtle distinction, granted, but it's an important one.

102
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Now, of course, the 1776 Commission was dissolved and their report was quickly discredited academically and deleted,

103
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:54,300
but the version of history it's trying to sell and the motivations behind its doing so sadly haven't gone anywhere.

104
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,300
So we're gonna take a quick read through the report today and see the story it's telling

105
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,300
and the rhetorical tricks it uses to argue its case.

106
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Before we get to that, though, we need to start off by talking about the 1619 Project,

107
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,300
because the 1776 Report is, in many ways, even in name, a response to the 1619 Project.

108
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,300
And to quote the introduction to the project itself,

109
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,300
the 1619 Project is an ongoing initiative from the New York Times Magazine that began in August 2019,

110
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,300
the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery.

111
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,300
It aims to reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery

112
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,300
and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.

113
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,300
So this, too, is self-admittedly an attempt to frame history in a particular way.

114
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,300
It's a response to those versions of history that leave out the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans.

115
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,300
The introductory essay to the project is written by journalist Nicole Hannah-Jones and titled

116
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,300
America Wasn't a Democracy Until Black Americans Made It One.

117
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
And this essay opens with the quote,

118
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Are democracies founding ideals were false when they were written? Black Americans have fought to make them true.

119
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,300
And the essay goes on to argue that when the American founders talked about freedom and equality and all that,

120
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,300
it wasn't really true, in large part because they were slave owners living in a slave trading society.

121
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,300
And it goes on to highlight the role that black Americans have played in bringing America closer to those ideals.

122
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,300
Other articles in the project are titled things like

123
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,300
What the Reactionary Politics of 2019 Owe to the Politics of Slavery,

124
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,300
and Why American Prisons Owe Their Cruelty to Slavery, and so on.

125
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,300
It's directly tying modern problems in American society to its history of slavery.

126
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Now, if you want my opinion, well, it's my video, isn't it?

127
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I find the main idea behind the 1619 project to be vitally important and sorely needed,

128
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:03,300
but the actual project itself is, in a few ways, kind of disappointing, which is unfortunate.

129
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Firstly, it's marred by a rather overstated case in one instance in particular.

130
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Nicole Hannah-Jones' opening essay was published with the claim that

131
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,300
one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain

132
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,300
was that they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.

133
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Now, this makes it sound like the American colonists, as a group,

134
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,300
all decided to declare their independence from Britain so they could keep the slave trade, which is not true.

135
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Now, as far as I'm aware, the British did at one point increase support for the revolutionary cause

136
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:42,300
in certain areas of the colonies by offering to free slaves who crossed the lines and fought for the British.

137
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,300
And an early draft of the Declaration of Independence even sees Jefferson complaining about this very offer.

138
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,300
But it's a stretch to imply that this was a primary reason for revolt among the colonists in general.

139
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,300
And this is something with which the New York Times eventually agreed,

140
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:04,300
amending the quote to say that protecting slavery was a primary motivation for some of the colonists.

141
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Now, this was a clarification that really shouldn't have had to have been made.

142
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Historian Leslie M. Harris wrote an article in Politico titled

143
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,300
I Helped Fact Check the 1619 Project, The Times Ignored Me,

144
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,300
in which she claims that she disputed the overstated claim in question,

145
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,300
but that the New York Times went ahead and published it anyway.

146
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
And to quote that article briefly,

147
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,300
So far, that's exactly what has happened.

148
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,300
And that's an interesting article, so I'll leave a link to that below if you want to check it out.

149
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,300
So that's rather unfortunate, isn't it?

150
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,300
Aside from that, allow me to briefly poke a false dichotomy here and bring up class.

151
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,300
And I say false dichotomy because sadly, in certain circles of the internet,

152
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:10,300
any mention of class during a discussion of race will see a few accusations of class reductionism thrown around.

153
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,300
And indeed, any mention of race during a discussion of class will see a few accusations of race reductionism thrown around.

154
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,300
And the answer to this has always been, and always will be,

155
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,300
that both issues are inextricably interlinked and need to be both given time and understood together.

156
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Now, most people understand that idea, I trust.

157
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:36,300
So, with that in mind, America wasn't a democracy until black Americans made it one.

158
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Now, this implies America wasn't a democracy at some point in the past, but it is now.

159
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
But is it really?

160
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,300
You know, it wasn't when black people and other groups were entirely prohibited from participation, of course,

161
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:55,300
but if we're using people's inability to participate in democracy to declare America to not be a democracy,

162
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,300
then it still isn't today.

163
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Many people still can't participate, and even for those who can,

164
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:09,300
their level of participation in the political process is dictated directly by their wealth and position within the economic system.

165
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Black people have the right to vote, which is great, but there are a hundred ways that vote can be stolen from them.

166
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Perfectly legally, too, with gerrymandering, various forms of voter suppression,

167
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,300
the enormous amount of money influencing politics, and so on.

168
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,300
The problem is that the principles of democracy run counter to the principles of capitalism.

169
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,300
And this is the main reason I personally find the 1619 Project to be rather disappointing.

170
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,300
When it comes time to criticize capitalism, it doesn't go far enough.

171
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,300
Another essay in the 1619 Project is titled,

172
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,300
American Capitalism is Brutal, You Can Trace That to the Plantation.

173
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,300
And that essay does as it says, it looks at modern economic inequality and injustices,

174
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,300
and finds roots or comparisons for those things in the practices of the slave trade.

175
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,300
The essay highlights that it wasn't only racism motivating the actions of the slave owners,

176
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,300
there were systemic financial incentives for a lot of what they were doing.

177
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,300
So this all sounds fine on the surface, right?

178
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,300
The problem for me is that the essay pulls up short of really condemning capitalism.

179
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,300
American capitalism is called a racist capitalism, or low-road capitalism,

180
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,300
and is compared unfavorably to other capitalist countries that have better workers' rights,

181
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,300
higher wages, more union representation, and so on.

182
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,300
And this is just taking too narrow a view of capitalism, in my opinion.

183
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,300
It implies that what needs to happen is for America to cast off its racism

184
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,300
and take the high road in capitalism, ensuring workers get better rights and higher wages and all that.

185
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,300
Which, fair enough, it does. That does need to happen.

186
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,300
But that won't solve the issues at the heart of capitalism.

187
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,300
You can make things temporarily and locally nicer under capitalism.

188
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:04,300
There are capitalist countries, as the essay points out, with better workers' rights than America,

189
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
but they're not operating in a vacuum.

190
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,300
They're part of a global capitalist system, and whatever rights they've secured within their own borders,

191
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:18,300
they're still benefiting from being part of an exploitative system that denies those rights to people in other places.

192
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Unfortunately, I'll have to shelve my lefty gripes about the shortcomings of the 1619 project for the rest of the video.

193
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Because while I might wish that the wider argument taking place was between two groups of non-racists

194
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,300
who only disagree on the issue of capitalism, there is someone else at the table here.

195
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,300
And annoyingly, their position distorts the boundaries of the conversation somewhat.

196
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,300
And because of that, I will concede that whatever my problems with the project,

197
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,300
when we consider the traditional way American history was, or still is often taught,

198
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,300
you know, comprising mostly of uncritical veneration of a bunch of white slave owners,

199
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:03,300
efforts to re-examine American history to center the impact of slavery are sorely needed, clearly.

200
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,300
In an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News last year,

201
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,300
then-President Trump brought up the 1619 project when asked about previous statements of his

202
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,300
indicating he thinks that schools are teaching students to hate their country.

203
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
So Wallace asked,

204
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,300
"'You said our children are taught in school to hate our country. Where do you see that?'

205
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
To which Trump replied,

206
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:34,300
"'I just look at... I look at school. I watch, I read, look at the stuff. Now they want to change.'

207
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,300
1492. Columbus discovered America.

208
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:45,300
You know, we grew up. You grew up. We all did. We all grew up.

209
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,300
That's what we learned. Now they want to make it the 1619 project.

210
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:56,300
They... Where did that come from? What does it represent? I don't even know, so...

211
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
And Wallace points out,

212
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
To which Trump responds,

213
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300
Very bizarre statements there.

214
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
I'm not sure what we can learn from that,

215
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,300
apart from the fact that the 1619 project is clearly occupying space

216
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,300
in what we can charitably refer to as the president's mind.

217
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:22,300
At a speech on October 6th of last year when Trump was talking about the creation of the 1776 commission,

218
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,300
he also discussed the 1619 report,

219
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:32,300
saying it seeks to reframe our nation's history around the idea that the United States is not an exceptional country,

220
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,300
but an evil one.

221
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,300
And the 1776 report itself also mentions the 1619 report directly,

222
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,300
saying the journalists behind it have turned to bitterness and judgment.

223
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:51,300
So this report is very much the conservative rejoinder to the 1619 project's centering of slavery.

224
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,300
It's a response to what they see as an undermining of American exceptionalism.

225
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,300
The White House press release announcing the release of the report reads as follows,

226
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:14,300
The 1776 commission, comprised of some of America's most distinguished scholars and historians,

227
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,300
has released a report presenting a definitive chronicle of the American founding,

228
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,300
a powerful description of the effect the principles of the Declaration of Independence have had on this nation's history,

229
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:31,300
and a dispositive rebuttal of reckless re-education attempts that seek to reframe American history

230
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:37,300
around the idea that the United States is not an exceptional country, but an evil one.

231
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,300
So that's the same phrase about America being an exceptional country as in Trump's speech there.

232
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Now, of course, anyone who points to the principles of America's founders as the source of American exceptionalism

233
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
opens themselves up to the counterargument,

234
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
well, what about slavery?

235
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:00,300
You know, it's all well and good for America's founding fathers to talk about freedom and inalienable rights

236
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
and all men being created equal,

237
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,300
but at the same time, they owned humans.

238
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,300
They bought and sold and profited from and tortured slaves.

239
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,300
And there's really no getting away from this contradiction.

240
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:21,300
After its introduction, the first section of the 1776 report is titled The Meaning of the Declaration,

241
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,300
and that states,

242
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
But they owned slaves.

243
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,300
You know, there's no escaping that.

244
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,300
Any praise for America's founding principles has to be done in the abstract,

245
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,300
while acknowledging that in reality they were selectively applied,

246
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,300
and for a great many people living in the United States for a very long time, practically, they were a hypocritical lie.

247
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Anyone can talk about freedom and equality,

248
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:09,300
but those words are gonna ring a bit hollow coming from someone who keeps other humans in literal chains.

249
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Now, conservatives, such as those behind the 1776 report, don't really like slavery being mentioned in this context.

250
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:23,300
This is where a lot of the talk about kids being taught to hate their country comes from, right?

251
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Slavery is evil. The United States did slavery. Therefore, the United States is evil.

252
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,300
So to put ourselves in the shoes of the authors of the 1776 report here,

253
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
how do we deal with this?

254
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,300
How do we tell the story of America's founding in a patriotic, celebratory way,

255
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,300
without getting bogged down in discussions about the evils of slavery?

256
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Well, what we do is, we just don't mention slavery at all.

257
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Throughout their introduction and two opening sections concerning the founding of America,

258
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,300
there are zero mentions of slavery or the slave trade in the text.

259
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:07,300
They talk about the framers of the Constitution seeking to secure equal natural rights and prevent the re-emergence of tyranny,

260
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,300
but equal natural rights for who, though?

261
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,300
They mention the people's participation in the political process without mentioning that by people.

262
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,300
They do not mean the people, as in the people who lived there.

263
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:26,300
They mean the white people, or more often, just the property-owning white men.

264
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:35,300
If the 1619 Project was a centering of slavery in the American story, this is a de-centering of slavery, to put it mildly.

265
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:42,300
In order to tell a patriotic version of America's founding, slavery is simply excised from the history.

266
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,300
In the American exceptionalism version of events, slavery is kicked under the rug.

267
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,300
But the authors of the report do have to deal with the slavery issue.

268
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,300
They realize they can't get away with not mentioning it at all.

269
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,300
So having removed slavery from the history of America's founding,

270
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,300
they relegate it to a section of the report titled,

271
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Challenges to America's Principles,

272
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,300
where it's listed alongside things like fascism and communism.

273
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:16,300
Slavery is thus re-categorized as an antagonizing foreign force to be defeated by America,

274
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,300
rather than an inherent part of America.

275
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Having cordoned off slavery from the rest of American history,

276
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:29,300
the 1776 report sets about attempting to, well, make excuses for it.

277
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,300
And these excuses are very revealing.

278
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
They lead by saying,

279
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,300
than the exception throughout human history.

280
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
So, this is the first excuse.

281
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,300
Slavery was not a uniquely American evil, so slavery is evil to start with.

282
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,300
That's good, they got that far at least.

283
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
But it's not unique to America.

284
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Slavery is more the rule than the exception.

285
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Or put another way, American slavery was unexceptional.

286
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Now this excuse reveals why they had to separate out slavery from the broader history of the American founding,

287
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,300
because it blows a massive hole in their argument for American exceptionalism.

288
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:29,300
And this should go without saying really, but if you're trying to argue for America being exceptional,

289
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,300
you can't then excuse its flaws by claiming it is unexceptional.

290
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,300
That's trying to have it both ways.

291
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,300
America's good qualities are used to indicate it is special and unique and exceptional,

292
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,300
while its bad qualities are used to indicate nothing.

293
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,300
They're merely products of the time, so we can excuse those.

294
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,300
The report at one point states all the good things we see around us,

295
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,300
from the physical infrastructure, to our high standards of living, to our exceptional freedoms,

296
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,300
are direct results of America's unity, stability, and justice.

297
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,300
All of which in turn rest on the bedrock of our founding principles.

298
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,300
So it's saying the good things, and only the good things that Americans see today,

299
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,300
are directly traceable to its founding.

300
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,300
But the report announces the 1619 Project for doing what is close to the mirror of this,

301
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:26,300
claiming that many of America's present inequalities and flaws also have roots in its early history.

302
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,300
So we have to ask, why is this?

303
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:35,300
Why is it that only America's positive qualities are able to be traced from its history in this way?

304
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
That's rather convenient, isn't it?

305
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,300
The report goes on to highlight certain of the founders anti-slavery sentiments,

306
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,300
and casts their compromises with slavery as merely a practical political move.

307
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,300
But this is only telling part of the story.

308
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:57,300
We can't defend the founders as a group by saying that certain individuals personally disagreed with slavery

309
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,300
and merely compromised with it, because we have to ask, who were they compromising with?

310
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:08,300
They're not arguing with aliens threatening to blow up the Earth unless the United States keeps the slave trade, are they?

311
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:14,300
They were making compromises with other slave owning and slave trade supporting founders.

312
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,300
And by compromises here, I mean they made real legal compromises.

313
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:26,300
One provision in the Constitution at the time of its ratification forbade any restriction of the importation of slaves for 20 years.

314
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Certain founders disagreed with the slave trade, that is true.

315
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,300
But as a group, they not only kept it, they protected it.

316
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
The report states,

317
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:55,300
What history went on to show was that no durable union could continue to exist with those compromises.

318
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Now the authors of the 1776 report might still have a point about this American exceptionalism stuff

319
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,300
if America had been unique in its abolition of slavery or the slave trade,

320
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,300
or maybe it was particularly early to abolish it or something.

321
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
But it wasn't, was it?

322
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,300
The report says,

323
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:24,300
Then why, we might ask, did the United States take longer to legally outlaw the slave trade and slavery

324
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,300
than the tyrannical British Empire?

325
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Surely America's exceptional founding principles of freedom and equality

326
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:36,300
should have meant they were able to outlaw slavery before the Empire ruled by a monarch.

327
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Rarely there is just no getting around the contradiction at the heart of the American founding.

328
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:47,300
The founders proclaimed freedom and equality, while at the same time keeping other people in slavery.

329
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,300
Whatever their individual opinions about the slave trade,

330
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:57,300
whatever the political situation at the time, the sum of their actions led to a continuance of a system of slavery.

331
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
That's simply the truth.

332
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,300
It can't be ignored or excused, and it can't be removed from the story.

333
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:09,300
So let's step back for a second and ask, what is actually the issue here?

334
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,300
What's the problem with centering slavery for the authors of the 1776 report?

335
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Well, it's to do, I think, with how they view the purpose of historical education.

336
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:27,300
We shouldn't be learning from history in totality, with its moral complexities, its good and bad parts,

337
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,300
understanding its participants as humans with human flaws and failings.

338
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,300
What we should be doing is looking to history for patriotic and moral instruction,

339
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:43,300
understanding its participants as either heroes to be emulated or villains to be defeated.

340
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,300
This is history as parable. We're supposed to be being shown how best to live.

341
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:55,300
And this is why conservatives often conflate discussions of their country's historical crimes with an attack upon history in general.

342
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:00,300
Of course, you might say that if those crimes have gone underreported or unexplored,

343
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:07,300
then bringing them into the spotlight is unarguably broadening the history and deepening our understanding of it.

344
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:14,300
But you'd only say that if you were actually interested in learning from history, instead of looking to it as a source of patriotism.

345
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,300
We teach children about our historical role models so that they love their country.

346
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:25,300
By highlighting their crimes or failings, you thus must want children to hate their country.

347
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,300
In the section Teaching America, the report states,

348
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Educators must convey a sense of enlightened patriotism that equips each generation with a knowledge of America's founding principles,

349
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:41,300
a deep reverence for their liberties, and a profound love of their country.

350
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,300
And I'd like to compare that with another quote from later in the same section when they say,

351
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:52,300
States and school districts should reject any curriculum that promotes one-sided partisan opinions,

352
00:29:52,300 --> 00:30:00,300
activist propaganda, or factional ideologies that demean America's heritage, dishonor our heroes, or deny our principles.

353
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,300
You might think this contradicts, right?

354
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:11,300
Educators should not teach one-sided partisan opinions, but must teach children to be patriotic and love their country.

355
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,300
That doesn't make sense, does it? Because those are one-sided opinions.

356
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,300
But on closer examination, this is not a contradiction. It's phrased very specifically.

357
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:31,300
Schools should reject any curriculum that promotes one-sided partisan opinions, activist propaganda, or factional ideologies that demean America's heritage.

358
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:37,300
Because, of course, one-sided partisan opinions that celebrate America's heritage, those are fine.

359
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:44,300
What we don't want is biased one-sided opinions saying America is bad, but biased one-sided opinions saying America is good.

360
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,300
Well, brilliant.

361
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Now, before we move on, I just want to highlight one important thing about this mindset of looking to history as a source of patriotism,

362
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,300
and it's that the people who think like this assume others do too.

363
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,300
To them, we all think America's supposed greatness is rooted in its founding principles and the characteristics of its founders.

364
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,300
It's just that some of us want to use that information for evil.

365
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:15,300
And it's only a short jump from where we're at right now to get into the real conspiracy theorizing.

366
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,300
These attempts to undermine and destroy American society by teaching people about history,

367
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,300
what if they're not simply the actions of some lone wolf America-hating academic types?

368
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,300
What if it's an organized conspiracy?

369
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:35,300
Appendix 3 of the 1776 report is titled Created Equal or Identity Politics,

370
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:40,300
and that contains a subsection titled Intellectual Origins of Identity Politics,

371
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,300
and that shares the conspiracy theory that is cultural Marxism.

372
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,300
So, cultural Marxism, just quoting Wikipedia here for brevity,

373
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:58,300
is a far-right anti-Semitic conspiracy theory which claims Western Marxism as the basis of continuing academic and intellectual efforts to subvert Western culture.

374
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:06,300
The conspiracists claim that an elite of Marxist theorists and Frankfurt School intellectuals are subverting Western society

375
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:11,300
with a culture war that undermines the Christian values of traditionalist conservatism

376
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,300
and promotes decultural liberal values of the 1960s counterculture.

377
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,300
And the conspiracy theory is all here in the 1776 report.

378
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:28,300
They name the Frankfurt School, critical theory, intellectuals Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse,

379
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,300
the division of society into oppressed and oppressor groups,

380
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,300
the creation of a counterculture that seeks to destroy the established culture, and so on.

381
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:42,300
Now, to the uninitiated, this might seem like run-of-the-mill grumpy old man complaining, right?

382
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:49,300
Society is changing in a way that for conservatives, like those behind this report, doesn't make sense.

383
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,300
They think America and Americans are exceptional.

384
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,300
So when Americans do things they consider unexceptional, or un-American,

385
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,300
usually things like wanting a proper healthcare system, this doesn't make sense to them.

386
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,300
This couldn't be arising from within our own society.

387
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,300
This has to be some sort of organized outside antagonist force.

388
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,300
Kids these days are more interested in listening to the rap music than reading the Constitution.

389
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,300
Am I so out of touch? No, it's cultural Marxist brainwashing or something.

390
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,300
But this is not just idle complaining.

391
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,300
This is real far-right Nazi stuff, just with a few euphemisms here and there.

392
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,300
One reason that the Wikipedia article there calls this an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory

393
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,300
is that often cultural Marxists are criticized simply as a stand-in for Jewish people.

394
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:46,300
And, of course, the Nazi party themselves had their own variant of the cultural Marxist conspiracy theory,

395
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
which they called cultural Bolshevism.

396
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:54,300
When I read the intellectual origins of identity politics, it brought to mind something else that I'd read before,

397
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,300
and that's the historical roots of political correctness,

398
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,300
which is another introduction to the cultural Marxist conspiracy theory,

399
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,300
and a strikingly similar piece of writing right down to the title.

400
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,300
And if we look at the historical roots of political correctness, it's all here again.

401
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,300
We've got the Frankfurt School, there's critical theory,

402
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse, the division of society into oppressed and oppressor groups,

403
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,300
the creation of a counterculture, and so on again.

404
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,300
This passage is taken from the manifesto written by Anders Behring Breivik,

405
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,300
the Norwegian far-right terrorist who killed 77 people in 2011.

406
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,300
That manifesto is titled A European Declaration of Independence.

407
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Now, this should be worrisome, right?

408
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:45,300
That the White House website is publishing blatant white supremacist propaganda.

409
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Usually, it only publishes veiled white supremacist propaganda.

410
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
And I want to make two points about this.

411
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Firstly, this sort of thing is one reason why the more direct academic fact-checking debunking route

412
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,300
doesn't hit very hard with the sort of audience which is the target for this rubbish.

413
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,300
You know, of course those academics and historians are gonna say the report is wrong on the facts.

414
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,300
They're all part of a cultural Marxist conspiracy.

415
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Universities in the United States are often today hotbeds of anti-Americanism, libel, and censorship, the report says.

416
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:26,300
We see it anticipates an academic rebuttal, and so pre-defends itself by attempting to discredit the rebuttas

417
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,300
by branding them liars.

418
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,300
You know, they're just liars. You can't listen to what they say.

419
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:36,300
They're engaged in a conspiracy to destroy Western civilization, after all.

420
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,300
They'll say anything, so you can't listen to them. Only listen to me.

421
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:46,300
This is also, of course, part of a broader trend of conservative anti-intellectualism in general,

422
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:54,300
intended to brand academics and experts, you know, people who might know what they're talking about, as merely partisan activists.

423
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:01,300
Their proximity to whichever topic is in question, instead of conveying experience, is used as evidence for bias.

424
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:10,300
And taking this worldview to its logical conclusion, the most trustworthy person is therefore the person who knows least of all, right?

425
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,300
But the 1776 report doesn't just treat academics in this manner.

426
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:19,300
I want to move on now and have a think about the way in which the report treats black people.

427
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:25,300
The first essay of the 1619 project is broadly about the lingering effects of slavery and systemic racism

428
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,300
and black people's contributions to civil rights over the years and so on,

429
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,300
but it's also about how contemporary black people relate to that history, right?

430
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:40,300
The author talks about her own family's experiences living with racism and segregation,

431
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,300
and her own relationship to American history and patriotism.

432
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,300
And for the 1776 report, this represents a problem.

433
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Now, of course, when American history is taught to a group of American children,

434
00:36:53,300 --> 00:37:00,300
some of those children are inevitably going to recognize that the history contains people with the same skin color as them,

435
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:06,300
being bought and sold and enslaved for no other reason than having the same skin color as them.

436
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,300
Which, of course, means they, as a group, are going to relate to that history differently, right?

437
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,300
They're going to have a different understanding to the white majority,

438
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,300
who see their own skin color represented by the historical figures who, they're often being taught,

439
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,300
were brave and wise and heroic and also owned other people.

440
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:32,300
Which is a whole problem in itself, but regardless, my point is that the different groups are going to relate to the history in different ways.

441
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,300
This is, for the authors of the 1776 report, a question of national unity.

442
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Because Americans are not supposed to be having different interpretations of America's history,

443
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,300
they're all supposed to understand it in the same way.

444
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Now, of course, the report acts as if group identities are only ever invented and foisted on people

445
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,300
by cultural Marxists and partisan activist academics and so on.

446
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,300
They have no understanding of structural systemic racism.

447
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:05,300
For them, racism worthy of being organized against ended in the 1960s with the passing of the Civil Rights Act.

448
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
But we all know it didn't.

449
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:13,300
You can teach a purely patriotic version of American history to all children equally, whatever their background,

450
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:18,300
but when those children encounter the labor market, or have experiences with the police,

451
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,300
or try to buy a house, or any one of a hundred other examples like this,

452
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:27,300
they're going to be treated differently, based in part on those same group distinctions

453
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,300
that once branded some people as slaves and not others.

454
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:37,300
However colorblind we pretend society is now that different racial groups are technically legally equal,

455
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,300
the status quo sees these group identities and they are treated differently.

456
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,300
The divisions in American society are arising from inequalities inside American society,

457
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,300
not being injected by some outside force.

458
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:56,300
We see here the other side of the coin to the antisemitism of the Cultural Marxist Conspiracy Theory,

459
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,300
because it requires not just imagined Jewish manipulators,

460
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:06,300
but also an American black population that is incapable of properly identifying shared injustices.

461
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:13,300
It betrays a tremendous mistrust of black people to dismiss their reactions to their own experiences

462
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,300
as mere inventions of outside agitators.

463
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:26,300
Anyway, all that aside, how does the 1776 report, with its singular, pointedly not open to interpretation version of American history,

464
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,300
deal with black people?

465
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Because as the 1619 report highlights, black people have often been at the forefront of pushes for social change in the United States,

466
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,300
and thus have often been some of the most vocal critics of America's failings.

467
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,300
And the report deals with this by playing a rhetorical trick.

468
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,300
Let's first talk about their presentation of Martin Luther King Jr.

469
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:53,300
They include pictures of King, of course, nice big space-filling pictures,

470
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,300
but they also quote him, such as here when they include an excerpt from his I Have a Dream speech

471
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:04,300
in which King praises the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

472
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,300
And they quote this passage again in the section titled Racism and Identity Politics

473
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,300
when talking about the reforms brought about by the Civil Rights Movement.

474
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
But all is not well.

475
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:22,300
It seemed, finally, that America's nearly two-century effort to realize fully the principles of the Declaration had reached a culmination.

476
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,300
But the heady spirit of the original Civil Rights Movement, whose leaders forcefully quoted the Declaration of Independence,

477
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,300
the Constitution, and the rhetoric of the founders and of Lincoln, proved to be short-lived.

478
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:39,300
The Civil Rights Movement was almost immediately turned to programs that ran counter to the lofty ideals of the founders.

479
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,300
The ideas that drove this change had been growing in America for decades,

480
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,300
and they distorted many areas of policy in the half-century that followed.

481
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:53,300
Among the distortions was the abandonment of non-discrimination and equal opportunity in favor of group rights,

482
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
not unlike those advanced by Calhoun.

483
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:03,300
That's John C. Calhoun, 7th Vice President of the United States and vocal supporter of slavery there, and his followers.

484
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:10,300
The justification for reversing the promise of colorblind civil rights was that past discrimination requires present effort,

485
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:17,300
or affirmative action in the form of preferential treatment to overcome longer crude inequalities.

486
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:24,300
And all this means that identity politics makes it less likely that racial reconciliation and healing can be attained

487
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,300
by pursuing Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream for America.

488
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:36,300
So, oh no, Civil Rights Movement, you were doing so well, weren't you? But then you went and took it too far.

489
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:43,300
How can we attain Martin Luther King's dream for America if you go off pushing for wacky ideas like affirmative action?

490
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:48,300
Certainly, Martin Luther King wouldn't have supported that, right?

491
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,300
However, a year after his I Have a Dream speech, King wrote the following.

492
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:59,300
Whenever this issue of compensatory or preferential treatment for the Negro is raised, some of our friends recoil in horror.

493
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,300
The Negro should be granted equality, they agree, but he should ask for nothing more.

494
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,300
On the surface, this appears reasonable, but it is not realistic.

495
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:14,300
For it is obvious that if a man enters the starting line of a race 300 years after another man,

496
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,300
the first would have to perform some incredible feat in order to catch up.

497
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
King is elsewhere quoted as saying,

498
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,300
And in 1965, King was interviewed by writer Alex Haley,

499
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,300
who, referring to King's support for a jobs program for young black people, asked him,

500
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,300
Indeed. Can any fair-minded citizen deny that the Negro has been deprived?

501
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Few people reflect that for two centuries the Negro was enslaved and robbed of any wages,

502
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,300
potential accrued wealth which would have been the legacy of his descendants.

503
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:07,300
All of America's wealth today could not adequately compensate its Negroes for his centuries of exploitation and humiliation.

504
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:15,300
It is an economic fact that a program such as I propose would certainly cost far less than any computation of two centuries of unpaid wages,

505
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,300
plus accumulated interest.

506
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,300
So, what's going on here then?

507
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:28,300
The authors of the 1776 report appear to be misrepresenting Martin Luther King Jr.'s opinions,

508
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,300
if you can believe such a thing.

509
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:38,300
Now, I'd like to make clear here that I have not caught the authors of the 1776 report making an unwitting mistake here.

510
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,300
They know exactly who King was and what his opinions were.

511
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,300
They know he supported affirmative action, they know he was a vocal critic of capitalism,

512
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:55,300
they know he supported a radical redistribution of economic power, and they hate him for that.

513
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,300
They absolutely despise the man.

514
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,300
But conservatives also know that King is today a broadly popular and beloved figure.

515
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,300
So, a frontal assault, the kind to which they would subject King if he were alive today,

516
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:13,300
you know, calling him a traitorous communist cultural Marxist and all that, would backfire.

517
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,300
So, the conservative tactic with regards to King is one of selective quotation.

518
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:24,300
They overemphasize a single line from one of his speeches and then they pretend that's all he ever said.

519
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,300
If you got all your information about Martin Luther King Jr. from this report,

520
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:35,300
you'd think he popped into existence in 1963 to say racism sure is bad and then he just fell off the earth or something.

521
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,300
Now, the aim of this tactic is twofold. Firstly, it defangs King, right?

522
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:47,300
It makes him into a simplistic storybook character who just quotes the founding fathers and says it's bad to be racist,

523
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,300
and that's all he does.

524
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:56,300
But the other aim here is to use this strawman version of King as a standard against which other black people can be judged negatively.

525
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:02,300
The point of praising King before going on to criticize, for instance, those who support affirmative action programs,

526
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:07,300
is to give the impression that King would not support affirmative action programs.

527
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,300
Of course, the real Martin Luther King Jr. did support affirmative action programs, but that doesn't matter.

528
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,300
We're not talking about him. We're talking about storybook Martin Luther King Jr.,

529
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,300
and he wouldn't support affirmative action programs.

530
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:26,300
He would quote the founding fathers and say it was bad to be racist, and that's all he would do.

531
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:35,300
This is not a tactic invented by the 1776 reports I'd like to make clear, lest I give the impression they're somehow being inventive in their lies.

532
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:41,300
This is an old conservative tactic for dealing with the radical activist Martin Luther King Jr.

533
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:49,300
who talked about economic equality and criticized American imperialism and was arrested and jailed for his opinions.

534
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:54,300
They just make a new Martin Luther King Jr. at the head of a toothless civil rights movement

535
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,300
which saw as its final goal legal equality, but demanded nothing further.

536
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:05,300
Martin Luther King Jr. is not the only black person in the 1776 report to get this treatment.

537
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:13,300
They also quote Frederick Douglass. They close out the main text of the report with a quote from Frederick Douglass, actually, and that reads as follows.

538
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:19,300
The Declaration of Independence is the ring bolt to the chain of your nation's destiny, so indeed I regard it.

539
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,300
The principles contained in that instrument are saving principles.

540
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:29,300
Stand by those principles, be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost.

541
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:36,300
So that's another black social reformer singing the praises of the Declaration of Independence completely out of context.

542
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,300
No further analysis needed, right?

543
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,300
Frederick Douglass said the Declaration of Independence was good.

544
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,300
That's it. That's the end of the point.

545
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:52,300
But allow me to quote from the same speech as the 1776 report pulled that quote from.

546
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:58,300
So this is an abridged version of a speech by Douglass titled, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July.

547
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,300
Now, I'm not going to be able to do this justice, obviously, but here we go.

548
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:09,300
So, after praising the Declaration of Independence and its principles, Douglass goes on to say,

549
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:15,300
Fellow citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today?

550
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,300
What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence?

551
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:27,300
Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice embodied in that Declaration of Independence extended to us?

552
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:32,300
Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions?

553
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:38,300
But such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us.

554
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,300
I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary.

555
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,300
Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us.

556
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,300
The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common.

557
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:59,300
The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you, not by me.

558
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,300
This Fourth of July is yours, not mine.

559
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,300
I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from the slave's point of view.

560
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,300
Standing there, identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine,

561
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:20,300
I do not hesitate to declare with all my soul that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this Fourth of July.

562
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:28,300
Whether we turn to the declarations of the past or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting.

563
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:34,300
America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future.

564
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,300
What to the American slave is your Fourth of July?

565
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:45,300
I answer, a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.

566
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:53,300
To him, your celebration is a sham, your boasted liberty an unholy license, your national greatness, swelling vanity,

567
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:00,300
your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless, your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fronted impudence,

568
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:06,300
your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery, your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings,

569
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:13,300
with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him me a bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy,

570
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:18,300
a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.

571
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:26,300
There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour.

572
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:33,300
Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world,

573
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:41,300
travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation,

574
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:48,300
and you will say with me that for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.

575
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:53,300
Fellow citizens, I will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies.

576
00:49:53,300 --> 00:50:02,300
The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretense, and your Christianity as a lie.

577
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,300
Cor blimey, he really gave it to them, didn't he?

578
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:15,300
So, what's my point here? Well, though it was set up to counter the claim that the United States is not an exceptional country, but an evil one,

579
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:26,300
the 1776 report closes out with a quote from a speech in which the speaker very forcefully and repeatedly declares the United States to be the most evil place in the whole world.

580
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,300
Which is rather funny, isn't it?

581
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,300
But again, this is not a mistake.

582
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:42,300
Both King and Douglas praised America's founding principles, but then went on to say that America was betraying those principles, not living up to them, proving them to be practically lies.

583
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,300
The 1776 report snips off the criticism and presents only the praise.

584
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:56,300
Now, we could do the same thing to the 1619 report, which also praises America's principles prior to criticizing it for not living up to them.

585
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,300
For instance, here's a quote taken out of context here.

586
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:07,300
In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson sat at his portable writing desk in a rented room in Philadelphia and penned these words.

587
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:19,300
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

588
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:31,300
For the last 243 years, this fierce assertion of the fundamental and natural rights of humankind to freedom and self-governance has defined our global reputation as a land of liberty.

589
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,300
So, there we go.

590
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:41,300
Stripped of all context, of all the following criticism, of the accusation that while these ideals are noble in spirit, they are not being delivered upon,

591
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:48,300
stripped of that, these words now appear only as mindless celebration of the United States and its founding principles.

592
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,300
This is precisely what was done to the speeches of King and Douglas.

593
00:51:52,300 --> 00:52:01,300
It turns out that what conservatives like those behind the 1776 report most appreciate about figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglas

594
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:07,300
is that they're dead, and cannot defend themselves when their words and ideas are misappropriated.

595
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:15,300
In life, they criticized America, but they're dead now, and therefore they can't correct us when we cherry-pick lines out of their speeches.

596
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:22,300
So, we thus make them safe. We reduce them to being only reciters of white men's words.

597
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:30,300
Now, the authors of the 1619 Project are alive, and their arguments are contemporary. Their criticisms must be met.

598
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:41,300
The authors of the 1776 report cannot disagree that the institution of slavery was evil and unacceptable and counter to America's supposed ideals, which is all true,

599
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:48,300
but they cannot accept this criticism because of where it's coming from. Because it's coming from black people.

600
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:56,300
To the authors of this report, America's crimes, if they are to be acknowledged at all, are to be acknowledged by white men.

601
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,300
When the time comes, not pointed out by black people, speaking out of turn.

602
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:05,300
What matters here is white control of the conversation.

603
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:14,300
If living black people criticize America, we compare them unfavorably to the mythological cartoon version of figures like King and Douglas,

604
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,300
the respectable black people who we say did it right, after we've given them a whitewashing, that is.

605
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:29,300
By picking and choosing which black people have legitimate things to say, and who are merely ideological, motivated partisan activists,

606
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,300
we're making the claim that it is the right of white people to decide this.

607
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:41,300
American history is a white man's story. We insist black people can observe and mouth along with the words if they like,

608
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:46,300
but they are not allowed to complain, and they're certainly not allowed to direct.

609
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:55,300
After they die, we may graciously acknowledge that they had some part in the story, but only because they were inspired by the ideas of white men.

610
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:02,300
Now, of course, the big win for the 1776 report is that they got this rubbish published at all.

611
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:08,300
Trump gave them a platform to share their racist conspiracy nonsense, and they used it.

612
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:15,300
Their report was quickly discredited and deleted, but it will always have been published on the White House website,

613
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,300
and that gives their arguments a seriously undue legitimacy.

614
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:28,300
The report was quickly deleted, sure, but that it existed at all means its particular brand of patriotic education can serve as a blueprint.

615
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:35,300
Texas lawmaker unveils plans for 1836 project to commemorate state's independence from Mexico.

616
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:43,300
A Texas lawmaker has unveiled plans for a committee that would promote patriotic education across the state's schools, parks, and museums.

617
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:52,300
Rep. Tan Parker is pressing for the 1836 project, named after the year Texas achieved independence from Mexico,

618
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,300
according to legislation filed Monday.

619
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,300
The lawmaker said in a news release,

620
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:20,300
Now, I feel some sympathy with all you Americans on this one, as over here in the UK, we've recently dialed up our own particular brand of patriotic nonsense.

621
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:26,300
Our revered historical figure who must not be insulted is Winston Churchill, the man who, as we all know,

622
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:35,300
single-handedly defeated the entire military force of Nazi Germany and definitely wasn't a eugenicist and open white supremacist, oh no.

623
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:46,300
Criticisms of Churchill or the various crimes of the British Empire are met by conservatives over here in much the same way that criticisms of the American founders are met over there.

624
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:54,300
Now, I'd like not to worry about all this and see it merely as the last desperate flailings of an increasingly irrelevant conservative mindset,

625
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:03,300
just trying to pass itself on to the next generation, as people of the previous generations increasingly, well, do what all people do.

626
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:08,300
Unfortunately, I don't think that this is something that's just gonna go away by itself.

627
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:17,300
All this patriotism, nationalism, racism, and so on isn't just a generational thing, nor does it stem solely from individual flaws.

628
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,300
It serves an economic purpose, too.

629
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:29,300
If you're a capitalist, you want your workers to see immigrants and foreigners as competition, not as fellow workers, which is what they are.

630
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:34,300
If you can't keep people divided and unequal, they'll unite and demand equality.

631
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:40,300
So, as long as there's profit in keeping people divided, attempts to divide people will persist.

632
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,300
So, this stuff has to be met actively.

633
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,300
You can't just wait for your parents to die.

634
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,300
That was the point of this video, I suppose. There we go, we found it.

635
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,300
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

636
00:56:53,300 --> 00:57:00,300
And as always, thank you especially to all my lovely supporters over on Patreon, some of whom should be scrolling by right now.

637
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:09,300
As always, patrons get early access to rough versions of my new videos with various mistakes in which they very helpfully point out and make fun of me for.

638
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,300
And I'll leave a link to my Patreon page below if you would like to check that out.

639
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,300
Alright, that's all from me today, folks. I'll see you next time.
