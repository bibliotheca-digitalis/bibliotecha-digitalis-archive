1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Hello, everyone. Now then, what would you say if I told you that I knew of a very generous Nigerian prince

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,000
who needed your help to move his fast riches out of his country?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,500
Or what if I told you I could sell you a magic brain pill that will make you smarter?

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Or, how about this one?

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,000
What if I told you that I could teach you an entire college course in just five minutes?

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,000
How would you like to learn a lot in a short amount of time?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
A major infusion of knowledge in, say, five minutes?

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,500
And what if those five minutes distilled the best ideas from some of the best minds in the world?

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,000
Just as a shot of espresso boosts your energy, a shot of Prager University boosts your brain.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Because not only will you have more knowledge, you will have more wisdom.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,500
If you think I'm exaggerating, there's an easy way to find out. Just watch a course.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,500
That is Dennis Prager there, in a video titled, Welcome Prager University.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right, Prager University is an online university.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Now, I know it looks like just a YouTube channel and not a university, but it is. It is a university.

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,000
And I know the quote, courses, look like YouTube videos, but they're not.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,500
They're real university courses taught by some of the quote, best minds in the world.

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,000
You can tell this because they come with study guides.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For example, here's the study guide for the video, Feminism 2.0,

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
which has sections to be filled in during and after watching the video,

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,500
discussion and review questions, and a quiz with questions like,

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,000
It is easy for feminists to forget that men A. Gave women the right to vote,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
B. Gave up their monopoly on political power, C. Invented birth control, and D. All of the above.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,500
Their answer, of course, being all of the above.

24
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Now, the horrible reality suggested by these study guides is that there is someone somewhere in the world

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,500
homeschooling their children using these videos and, like, quizzing them on them afterwards,

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
which, you know, doesn't even bear thinking about, really, does it?

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:15,500
So, okay, Prager University is not a university. It's not an academic institution of any kind, actually.

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,000
It is a YouTube channel created by conservative talk show host, Dennis Prager,

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,500
and funded by the billionaire businessman, the Wilkes Brothers,

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,500
who got rich by creating a hydraulic fracking company called FracTech. Seriously.

31
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
So when you see PragerU videos with titles like,

32
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Why You Should Love Fossil Fuel, well, that's why.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, the Wilkes Brothers also donate huge amounts of money to conservative politicians,

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,500
such as when they gave $15 million to a super PAC backing Ted Cruz in 2015.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
So when you see PragerU videos with titles like,

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,000
Money in Politics, What's the Problem?, well, that's why.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now, I feel like I've came out a little harshly here.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It'd be unfair, at this point, to just dismiss the whole channel as a biased conservative fantasy project

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
funded by two oil billionaires. So, let's back up a bit.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,500
Why am I talking about PragerU today?

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, you, like me, may have noticed PragerU's videos being promoted all over YouTube,

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
including sometimes on videos of mine and my lefty pals.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now, that's because PragerU has an enormous annual budget

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,500
and spends a large proportion of that on advertising itself.

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Anyway, I had mostly ignored these advertisements until fairly recently,

46
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,000
when, via a series of tragic misclicks, I ended up on this video.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Who Needs Feminism? featuring speaker Andrew Clavin,

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,500
which begins with Andrew Clavin stating,

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,000
I am an anti-feminist.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And let me show you what I saw after that.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Feminism denigrates masculinity in men by relentlessly calling us toxic for our flaws,

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
rather than appreciating our natural qualities of energy, risk-taking, and leadership.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But it also denigrates femininity in women,

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
working to replace most women's commitment to relationship and child-rearing with male obsessions,

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,500
such as career status and strength.

56
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
What's the result?

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Take a look at the quintessential feminist icon, Rosie the Riveter, flexing her muscle.

58
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,000
The truth is, any man of the same size and fitness can make a bigger, stronger muscle than Rosie can.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,500
Now, I feel like I could write a whole dissertation on the problems with these two paragraphs here,

60
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,500
but I'll just read through them now quickly and try to give you the short version.

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,000
So, here we go.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,500
Feminism denigrates masculinity in men.

63
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,000
Now, hold on.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Here's the first problem.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,500
No, it doesn't.

66
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Feminism doesn't do anything independently.

67
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not a monster that lives in a cave somewhere plotting against men.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,500
You know, one person calling themselves a feminist might do that,

69
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
but other people calling themselves feminists will not.

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Feminism is an idea with different interpretations.

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,000
It has no individual agency of its own,

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and there's no supreme leader of feminism who sets the official feminism agenda.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Anyway, sorry, short version. Right.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Feminism denigrates masculinity in men by relentlessly calling us toxic for our flaws,

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,000
rather than appreciating our natural qualities of energy risk-taking and leadership.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So, you know, woe is me.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
People are saying men are bad instead of saying they're good. How unfair.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But it also denigrates femininity in women,

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,500
working to replace most women's commitment to relationship and child-rearing

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,500
with male obsessions, such as career status and strength.

81
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Now, again, feminism doesn't actually do either of those things.

82
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,500
What most feminists would probably take issue with in these two sentences

83
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,000
is Andrew Clavin claiming abstract concepts like energy are a natural quality of just one sex.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,500
Which doesn't really make any sense, but whatever, let's get to the fun bit here.

85
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Now then, what's all this about?

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What's the result of, what, feminism?

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Feminism's denigration of the sexes, I guess.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,500
So, okay, the result of that is Rosie the Riveter flexing her muscle there.

89
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:22,000
But the truth is, the truth is, men have bigger muscles than the cartoon lady,

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and could beat her at an arm wrestling competition should one happen to break out, I suppose.

91
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,500
So the consequence of this malicious, sentient form of feminism

92
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,500
is that women today can be misled by World War II era inspirational work posters

93
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,500
into falsely believing that they could beat men in an arm wrestling competition.

94
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,000
Is that right there? Have I got that?

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,500
So, anyway, since PragerU brought it up, let's talk about Rosie the Riveter.

96
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Now, Rosie the Riveter was a World War II cultural icon.

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Not designed, you might be surprised to hear, to convey women's muscular superiority to men,

98
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,500
but as one of many government morale boosting campaigns aimed at encouraging women in the workforce,

99
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,000
particularly women working in what were traditionally considered male roles.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Now, why, you might ask, did the government want to encourage women to join the workforce?

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,500
Was it as part of some evil feminist campaign to attack masculinity and erode femininity?

102
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Well, no. You see, during World War II, there was a labor shortage,

103
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
because a lot of the men had been conscripted into the armed forces,

104
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,500
and so increasingly job openings in factories and the likes were filled by women.

105
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Women were encouraged to join the workforce to aid the war effort.

106
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,000
That's why that was happening. You know, we can do it as in win the war,

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
not like overthrow men with our superior biceps or something.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,500
And I would have liked to see Andrew Clavin try to defend his ideas during World War II.

109
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
You know, women shouldn't be working in factories. That's a male job.

110
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
They should be home looking after the kids and being all feminine.

111
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,500
And it's like, stop whining, Andrew. We've got to beat the Nazis here.

112
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,000
There's no time for all your gender rubbish.

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,500
So anyway, I was sufficiently blown away by this particular video that I decided to watch a few more.

114
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,500
And here's my first impression of the channel.

115
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,500
PragerU's boast of only needing five minutes to convey its ideas to you

116
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,000
is actually being a little too generous there.

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,500
I can tell you basically everything PragerU has to offer in a fraction of that time, so here goes.

118
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Firstly, feminism and other social justice causes are completely unnecessary,

119
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,500
right up until the point at which we all agree they did something necessary,

120
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,000
in which case the credit should go instead to Christian white men for allowing it to happen.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Secondly, capitalism is great and has absolutely no downsides, brackets, except for all the downsides,

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
which are actually the result of us not doing capitalism hard enough.

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,500
Thirdly, no, that's about it, really. What did that take? 30 seconds?

124
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Now, to be fair, a few videos do fall outside those parameters there,

125
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,000
but those two things are their bread and butter.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,500
Christian white men and capitalism are always good.

127
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,500
Anyone who questions either of those things is always bad.

128
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,500
And what I'm gonna do now is take a look at how PragerU expresses those ideas

129
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
and see how fairly they represent any counterarguments.

130
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,500
And not to give the game away here, but I did title my video How PragerU Lies to You.

131
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,000
So, okay, first up is How PragerU Lies to You About Feminism.

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And we'll stick with Andrew Clavin's video Who Needs Feminism here for a little while,

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,500
and let's read a little of the script.

134
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:49,000
Now, perhaps you'll protest. Isn't feminism simply the idea that women have the same human rights as men?

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,500
No. It isn't.

136
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
That philosophy is called classical liberalism,

137
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
which holds that we are all equally endowed by God

138
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,000
with the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Now, this is just basic misrepresentation.

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Clavin anticipates the fact that he'll be called out on his biased definition of feminism,

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and his answer to a hypothetical person presenting an alternative interpretation is...

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No. No.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,500
You're wrong. I'm right. Only my definition is right, not yours.

144
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,000
So there.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Which is not exactly advanced debate tactics, is it?

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Clavin's only offered evidence to feminism not being about equality of the sexes

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
is that he claims that philosophy is called classical liberalism,

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
which is silly all on its own,

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,500
but implicit here is that a single idea cannot be shared between two political philosophies,

150
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
which is ridiculous, obviously.

151
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Feminism could be about equality,

152
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,000
and also classical liberalism could be about equality,

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,500
because equality is not an idea that is singular to any one particular political movement.

154
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Later in his video, Clavin states,

155
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,000
Feminism has developed the historical mythology that men have oppressed women,

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,500
and now must be suppressed in their turn to even things out.

157
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,000
More misrepresentation here.

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'd just like to point out that not once in this video does Andrew Clavin quote a feminist,

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,500
or cite any particular feminist theory or literature,

160
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
and this should be a red flag.

161
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:30,000
Speaking personally here, I have never met any feminist who claims feminism is about suppressing men to even things out.

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Mainly, I've met feminists who say feminism is about equality,

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,500
but apparently they were all secretly classical liberalists or something.

164
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,000
Andrew Clavin here is arguing against a straw-man version of feminism

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,500
that only exists within the confines of his own imagination.

166
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,000
He doesn't name who he's talking about either because they don't exist and he's just making it up,

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
or because he's scared he'll get a response from an actual real person with realistic ideas,

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,500
and they're a lot harder to argue with than cartoon characters.

169
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Speaking of arguing with cartoon characters,

170
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
in their video, Who Killed the Liberal Arts,

171
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,000
which is one of many PragerU videos complaining about modern university campuses,

172
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,500
we can see the following.

173
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
There's some little cartoon professors there saying,

174
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,500
We repudiate the great humanist tradition on which much of Western civilization

175
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,500
and the Western university has been built.

176
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,000
What a foolishly self-defeating quote there from anonymous cartoon professor number two.

177
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,000
And later in the video, the cartoon professor really gives the game away when they say,

178
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I seek only to confirm my own world view.

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's quite a candid confession there,

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,500
and it's handy these cartoon professors are so forward with their hypocrisies, isn't it?

181
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,000
You know, given we've only got five minutes to argue against them.

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,500
Returning to feminism here,

183
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,000
I'd like to use two PragerU videos now to highlight a favorite little conservative contradiction of mine,

184
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,500
and we're gonna look first at a video about the employment system,

185
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,000
and then a video about the education system,

186
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and pay particular attention to how gendered differences are described and accounted for.

187
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,500
So first up is the video, There Is No Gender Wage Gap,

188
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
narrated by Christina Hoff Sommers,

189
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,000
which comes to the conclusion that there is a gender wage gap.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
Let's take a look.

191
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,000
Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization,

192
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,500
shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents

193
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
when you factor in different choices men and women make.

194
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,000
And the key word here is choice.

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make.

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,500
So okay, there is a gender wage gap despite the title of the video,

198
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,500
but it's okay, because the gap is accounted for by the different choices that men and women make.

199
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,000
Men and women are just fundamentally different and choose different careers,

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and the result of the sum of those individual choices is that men get paid more.

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,500
Changing the system to enforce equality here is entirely unnecessary.

202
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,000
The system itself is neutral, and the discrepancy in outcomes is only down to individual choice.

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Right, so on to video two, titled War on Boys, also narrated by Christina Hoff Sommers,

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
and let's take a look at that.

205
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Being a normal boy is a serious liability in today's classroom.

206
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,000
Compared with girls, boys earn lower grades, they win fewer honors,

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
they're far less likely to go to college.

208
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Boys are languishing academically while girls are prospering.

209
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:49,000
In an ever more knowledge-based economy, this is not a recipe for a successful society.

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We need to start thinking about how we can make our grade school classrooms more boy-friendly.

211
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,500
We need to reverse the boy-averse trends.

212
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Male underachievement is everyone's concern.

213
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,000
Now I'm not sure I need to go through the second half of this argument here.

214
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I assume most of you have probably got it already, but for the one of you who missed it, here's the contradiction.

215
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
When women are lagging behind men, for example in the wages they get paid, this is no problem whatsoever.

216
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,500
It's just a natural result of men and women's biological differences.

217
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,000
But when men are lagging behind women, such as receiving lower grades in school,

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,500
well, that's everyone's concern, and we need to institute system-wide reforms in order to reverse the trend.

219
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
And I like how biology is used here.

220
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,500
It's presented as both the reason to preserve a system when men are ahead,

221
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,500
and also as the reverse, to reform a system when men are behind.

222
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,000
The message seems to be that any societal system should cater to male biological traits,

223
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
or at least conservatives' estimation of what male biological traits are.

224
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And we can have some fun here by reversing the argument in favor of girls,

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,500
and maybe come up with some of our own flimsy evolutionary psychology too.

226
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
So, okay, girls do better in schools, but that's fine.

227
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Whatever gap there is between boys and girls is entirely accounted for by the different choices they make.

228
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Girls are good listeners, good communicators, they're better at multitasking.

229
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
This is just natural.

230
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,500
If boys choose to spend their time playing outside instead of studying, then they're free to do that.

231
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,500
But it would be unfair to expect equal grades for it.

232
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Anyway, let's move on now and examine PragerU's presentation of capitalism,

233
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,000
which is a frequent topic in videos like

234
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If You Hate Poverty, You Should Love Capitalism,

235
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Why You Love Capitalism,

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is Capitalism Moral,

237
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why Capitalism Works, and so on.

238
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Now, in these videos and others,

239
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
PragerU presents a, well, literally cartoonishly simple version of capitalism.

240
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's take a look at the video Why Capitalism Works,

241
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,500
which seeks to explain the basics of how businesses operate under capitalism.

242
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Now, they use the example of a flower shop.

243
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,500
A newly opened flower shop can be run in different ways, you see.

244
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,500
A selfish shop owner will put their needs before that of the customer,

245
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,000
and thus will not make any profits.

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Only businesses that satisfy their customers will succeed.

247
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Under capitalism, a business prospers only if customers voluntarily trade for its output.

248
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Now, the majority of the time, this is how PragerU talks about capitalism.

249
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's little cartoon people bumbling around, making cute, mutually beneficial transactions.

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,500
You know, I have a quantity of money, a store has a product I desire,

251
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,000
we trade those things and both profit.

252
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,500
Hurrah.

253
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,000
So, what do we think about this?

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Well, first off, I'd like to highlight that they chose a flower store for their example,

255
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
rather than, say, a weapons developer, or a predatory loan lender,

256
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
or a fracking company, say.

257
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,500
But since they picked a flower store, let's talk about that.

258
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,000
So, some flower stores are good and successful,

259
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and some flower stores are selfish and unsuccessful.

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
They each make a series of mutually beneficial trades with customers,

261
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,500
and naturally, the successful stores do better than the unsuccessful ones.

262
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,000
And, what, the end?

263
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You know, we restart the simulation tomorrow.

264
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No, in actual reality, things continue happening after that, so let's carry on with the example.

265
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The successful flower store, after all their transactions, has built up some wealth.

266
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And if they build up enough wealth, they can start to influence the market outside of those simple, customer-level transactions.

267
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's say they purchase the unsuccessful flower store, and several others, and unite them all under the same brand.

268
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,500
So now you've got Flower Corp.

269
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Now, Flower Corp, being a big business, will be sought after for big contracts.

270
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,500
There will be competition to be the supplier of seeds, say, to Flower Corp.

271
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Flower Corp will be able to use its large market share as leverage to make beneficial deals with its suppliers,

272
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
which will then mean they can cut costs on the consumer end,

273
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,000
perhaps lower than it's possible for any startup business to compete with.

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is one reason why big box stores kill off small local businesses, as well as, you know, convenience.

275
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They can afford to sell for less, because they buy for less, because they buy in bulk.

276
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So, Flower Corp starts pricing flower startups out of the market, and just to be sure,

277
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
maybe they open a Flower Corp store nearby any new flower businesses to divide their sales.

278
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Now, let's see how far this metaphor can be stretched here.

279
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Let's say Flower Corp starts lobbying politicians to relax flower industry regulations and cut flower industry taxes,

280
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and pretty soon, half the Senate is in the pockets of Big Flower.

281
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's say Flower Corp becomes so powerful that they're able to insert their executives into the staff of many of the country's most powerful politicians.

282
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Let's imagine their CEO becomes Vice President, even,

283
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and starts pushing for a war with the Netherlands in order to install a puppet government

284
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
that will give their country cheap deals and all those fancy tulips they've got.

285
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Let's say a whole speculative flower market opens up, massively inflating the price of flowers until they cost more than a house.

286
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And a quick editorial note here, this one has actually happened in reality.

287
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And let's say that Flower Corp becomes so large that it becomes too big to fail,

288
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
so that when the flower bubble finally bursts, the government will step in and bail them out with public money.

289
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The government is staffed with their executives and funded by their lobbyists, after all.

290
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And finally, let's say that public opinion starts turning against Flower Corp and its various shady dealings,

291
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and more generally, against the flawed system that allowed Flower Corp to cause so much damage.

292
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So, Flower Corp decides to fund a YouTube channel hosting videos that explain how they're actually great and can do no wrong.

293
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And there we are, there. We've caught back up to the present day.

294
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So, that's the saga of Flower Corp there.

295
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Now, in reality, all of those actions were carried out by the defense, oil, and financial industries,

296
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
not the flower industry.

297
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But how does PragerU, you might be wondering, account for all of those terrible happenings?

298
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
They were all a result of capitalist institutions acting in their own self-interest,

299
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
trying to increase their own profits, which is supposed to be beneficial for everyone, right?

300
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, let's introduce the conservative cop-out answer for explaining away all the problems of capitalism.

301
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Crony capitalism. What is it? Why is it so bad?

302
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
To answer these questions, let's think about good old-fashioned capitalism.

303
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It is premised on the free exchange of goods or services between independent agents.

304
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Capitalism is moral because it is premised on a voluntary exchange between independent parties,

305
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
who agree to the deal only because it creates value for everybody.

306
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Crony capitalism is immoral because one of the parties, the government, has been bought off.

307
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Now, here I'd just like to remind you of this video I showed earlier.

308
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Money and politics. What's the problem?

309
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, here you go, PragerU. You've discovered it.

310
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So, crony capitalism, then.

311
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This is a concept PragerU talks about a few times and always in a particularly biased way.

312
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
As you'll see, the government is always to blame.

313
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So, crony capitalism is unfair and immoral because the government has been bought off.

314
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But by who, though, you might be wondering?

315
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well, private interests. Should they share any of the blame?

316
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, let's watch a brief clip from their video, The Speech Every 2015 College Grad Needs to Hear.

317
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Washington has produced a bubble in higher education just the way it produced the bubble in housing.

318
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Some government planners decided that too few people owned homes.

319
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So, the planners decided to force an increase in home ownership.

320
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
They lowered lending standards for people seeking a mortgage.

321
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
This produced a glut of subprime loans and subprime borrowers.

322
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And then a crash.

323
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So, that was the housing market crash according to PragerU there.

324
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And let's just read through that one more time.

325
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Washington has produced a bubble in higher education just the way it produced the bubble in housing.

326
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Some government planners decided that too few people owned homes.

327
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So, the planners decided to force an increase in home ownership.

328
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Now, absent here is any mention of lobbying, naturally.

329
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Just silly government officials doing silly nonsense things for no reason.

330
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
They lowered lending standards for people seeking a mortgage.

331
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And side note, we call that deregulation, which we're not allowed to say is a bad thing.

332
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So, we have to call it something else like lowered lending standards instead.

333
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This produced a glut of subprime loans and subprime borrowers and then a crash.

334
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So, this produced a glut of subprime loans.

335
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
From who, though? Did they spring forth from the earth?

336
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No, it was private institutions who were again being presented as blameless here.

337
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Only the government is at fault for not preventing the ill effects of the greed of the private sector.

338
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Greed which is excusable because working in your own self-interest is always good.

339
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Unless you're a politician approached by a lobbyist with a suitcase full of money, of course.

340
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
In which case, you're expected to ignore your own self-interest and only consider the public good.

341
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
This is a racket.

342
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Capitalism is always perfect, except for when it isn't.

343
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
In which case, it was the government's fault for not stopping it.

344
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And PragerU's solution to this problem is equally nonsensical.

345
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
See, according to them, the private sector only lobbies and influences the government into doing bad things because the government is so big and powerful.

346
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
If we limit the government, then they won't want to control it as much apparently.

347
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Which is a bit like saying, if we just let the foxes into the henhouse, think of the money we'll save on fencing.

348
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Now, I'm gonna close out soon, but I can't go without giving a special mention to PragerU's use of graphs to illustrate their points.

349
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
We've already seen this one from the video, Why Capitalism Works, which is almost nonsense if you look at it for more than five seconds.

350
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Here's another good one from their video, Make Men Masculine Again, showing the masculine turning into the feminine over time, distance, temperature, who knows?

351
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
This one's from their video, Blacks in Power Don't Empower Blacks.

352
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Which apparently shows labor participation rates, but doesn't.

353
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You know, these are just two orange rectangles. There's no values on them.

354
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
This one is from their video, Why is Modern Art So Bad, showing the quote, decline of artistic standards.

355
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Now, the vertical axis is at least labeled here with standards, which are measurable apparently.

356
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And they peaked just after 1850 and then declined until about 1970 there, until there were no more standards.

357
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
There are no artistic standards anymore whatsoever.

358
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
There's this one from their video, Hoover and the Great Depression, which shows industry with the economy lurking in the background there.

359
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And this one has two labels, Wage Rates, which are going down as layoffs are going up and getting dangerously close to that dark cloud there.

360
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I don't know what that's meant to signify, but it can't be good.

361
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Earlier in that video, we see this graph, Prices for Industrial Goods, which started out in 1929 at nearly three dollar signs there.

362
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Then prices fell to just two dollar signs throughout 1930, holding steady just long enough to underline the words, economy-wide deflation, which is handy.

363
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:23,000
After that, there's more bad news, I'm afraid, with prices falling yet again, threatening to reach just one dollar sign, which as we know is the lowest possible price.

364
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Now, anyone can make rubbish like this. I mean, look, here's one I made, for instance.

365
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
What does this show? Happiness increasing as number of feminists increases, I guess.

366
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Now, does this prove anything, this graph?

367
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And I'd just like to reiterate to any fans of PragerU who might be watching now, this is made up.

368
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Remember, I made this. Don't go around citing this.

369
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Now, you might say, Sean, picking on PragerU's graphs is unfair.

370
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They're not supposed to be real academic graphs. They're just little visual aids to complement what the speaker is talking about.

371
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
They're not peer-reviewed or anything. And I would say to that, exactly.

372
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
They're not real academic graphs, because this isn't a real academic institution. It's a YouTube channel.

373
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It can call itself whatever it likes, but a university it is not.

374
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

375
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I might come back to PragerU at some point.

376
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
A few of their videos seem possibly worthy of a more in-depth look, so we'll see about that.

377
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Let me know in the comments. Just kidding.

378
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I never read the comments. I'm not a masochist.

379
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I do read my curious cat questions, though, if you'd like to ask me a question on there.

380
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Now, before I go, I should mention here a couple of things that PragerU got right.

381
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Their video, Was the Civil War About Slavery?, is actually not bad.

382
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
They do not come to the conclusion that you would expect them to come to.

383
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Also, PragerU get points from me for arguing against bailing out failing financial institutions,

384
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
which I saw them do in a couple of videos.

385
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
A lot of the time, conservatives will go on about the brilliant competition of the free market,

386
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and then defend propping up failing banks with public money or something. It's highly hypocritical there.

387
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So credit to PragerU for avoiding doing that.

388
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Thanks, as always, to all my Patreon backers for supporting me in making videos like this.

389
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
A link to my Patreon page is below, if you'd like to check that out.

390
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Right. Thanks, folks. I'll see you next time.
