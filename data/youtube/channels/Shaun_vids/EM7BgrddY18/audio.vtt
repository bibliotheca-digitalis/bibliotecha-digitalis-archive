00:00.000 --> 00:06.700
Hello, everyone. Now then, what would you say if I told you that I knew of a very generous Nigerian prince

00:06.700 --> 00:11.000
who needed your help to move his fast riches out of his country?

00:11.000 --> 00:15.500
Or what if I told you I could sell you a magic brain pill that will make you smarter?

00:15.500 --> 00:17.500
Or, how about this one?

00:17.500 --> 00:23.000
What if I told you that I could teach you an entire college course in just five minutes?

00:23.500 --> 00:28.000
How would you like to learn a lot in a short amount of time?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.500
A major infusion of knowledge in, say, five minutes?

00:31.500 --> 00:37.500
And what if those five minutes distilled the best ideas from some of the best minds in the world?

00:37.500 --> 00:44.000
Just as a shot of espresso boosts your energy, a shot of Prager University boosts your brain.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.500
Because not only will you have more knowledge, you will have more wisdom.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.500
If you think I'm exaggerating, there's an easy way to find out. Just watch a course.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.500
That is Dennis Prager there, in a video titled, Welcome Prager University.

00:58.500 --> 01:03.000
That's right, Prager University is an online university.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.500
Now, I know it looks like just a YouTube channel and not a university, but it is. It is a university.

01:09.500 --> 01:15.000
And I know the quote, courses, look like YouTube videos, but they're not.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.500
They're real university courses taught by some of the quote, best minds in the world.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.000
You can tell this because they come with study guides.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
For example, here's the study guide for the video, Feminism 2.0,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
which has sections to be filled in during and after watching the video,

01:32.000 --> 01:36.500
discussion and review questions, and a quiz with questions like,

01:36.500 --> 01:42.000
It is easy for feminists to forget that men A. Gave women the right to vote,

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
B. Gave up their monopoly on political power, C. Invented birth control, and D. All of the above.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.500
Their answer, of course, being all of the above.

01:53.500 --> 01:58.500
Now, the horrible reality suggested by these study guides is that there is someone somewhere in the world

01:58.500 --> 02:03.500
homeschooling their children using these videos and, like, quizzing them on them afterwards,

02:03.500 --> 02:07.500
which, you know, doesn't even bear thinking about, really, does it?

02:07.500 --> 02:15.500
So, okay, Prager University is not a university. It's not an academic institution of any kind, actually.

02:15.500 --> 02:21.000
It is a YouTube channel created by conservative talk show host, Dennis Prager,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.500
and funded by the billionaire businessman, the Wilkes Brothers,

02:24.500 --> 02:30.500
who got rich by creating a hydraulic fracking company called FracTech. Seriously.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.500
So when you see PragerU videos with titles like,

02:33.500 --> 02:37.500
Why You Should Love Fossil Fuel, well, that's why.

02:37.500 --> 02:42.000
Now, the Wilkes Brothers also donate huge amounts of money to conservative politicians,

02:42.000 --> 02:47.500
such as when they gave $15 million to a super PAC backing Ted Cruz in 2015.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.500
So when you see PragerU videos with titles like,

02:50.500 --> 02:55.000
Money in Politics, What's the Problem?, well, that's why.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Now, I feel like I've came out a little harshly here.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
It'd be unfair, at this point, to just dismiss the whole channel as a biased conservative fantasy project

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
funded by two oil billionaires. So, let's back up a bit.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.500
Why am I talking about PragerU today?

03:11.500 --> 03:17.000
Well, you, like me, may have noticed PragerU's videos being promoted all over YouTube,

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
including sometimes on videos of mine and my lefty pals.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Now, that's because PragerU has an enormous annual budget

03:25.000 --> 03:28.500
and spends a large proportion of that on advertising itself.

03:28.500 --> 03:33.500
Anyway, I had mostly ignored these advertisements until fairly recently,

03:33.500 --> 03:38.000
when, via a series of tragic misclicks, I ended up on this video.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Who Needs Feminism? featuring speaker Andrew Clavin,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.500
which begins with Andrew Clavin stating,

03:44.500 --> 03:47.000
I am an anti-feminist.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And let me show you what I saw after that.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
Feminism denigrates masculinity in men by relentlessly calling us toxic for our flaws,

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
rather than appreciating our natural qualities of energy, risk-taking, and leadership.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
But it also denigrates femininity in women,

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
working to replace most women's commitment to relationship and child-rearing with male obsessions,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.500
such as career status and strength.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.000
What's the result?

04:13.000 --> 04:18.500
Take a look at the quintessential feminist icon, Rosie the Riveter, flexing her muscle.

04:18.500 --> 04:25.000
The truth is, any man of the same size and fitness can make a bigger, stronger muscle than Rosie can.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.500
Now, I feel like I could write a whole dissertation on the problems with these two paragraphs here,

04:29.500 --> 04:33.500
but I'll just read through them now quickly and try to give you the short version.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.000
So, here we go.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.500
Feminism denigrates masculinity in men.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.000
Now, hold on.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Here's the first problem.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.500
No, it doesn't.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.500
Feminism doesn't do anything independently.

04:46.500 --> 04:51.000
It's not a monster that lives in a cave somewhere plotting against men.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.500
You know, one person calling themselves a feminist might do that,

04:54.500 --> 04:57.500
but other people calling themselves feminists will not.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.500
Feminism is an idea with different interpretations.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.000
It has no individual agency of its own,

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
and there's no supreme leader of feminism who sets the official feminism agenda.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Anyway, sorry, short version. Right.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.500
Feminism denigrates masculinity in men by relentlessly calling us toxic for our flaws,

05:17.500 --> 05:22.000
rather than appreciating our natural qualities of energy risk-taking and leadership.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
So, you know, woe is me.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
People are saying men are bad instead of saying they're good. How unfair.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
But it also denigrates femininity in women,

05:31.000 --> 05:35.500
working to replace most women's commitment to relationship and child-rearing

05:35.500 --> 05:39.500
with male obsessions, such as career status and strength.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.500
Now, again, feminism doesn't actually do either of those things.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.500
What most feminists would probably take issue with in these two sentences

05:47.500 --> 05:54.000
is Andrew Clavin claiming abstract concepts like energy are a natural quality of just one sex.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.500
Which doesn't really make any sense, but whatever, let's get to the fun bit here.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.500
Now then, what's all this about?

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
What's the result of, what, feminism?

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Feminism's denigration of the sexes, I guess.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.500
So, okay, the result of that is Rosie the Riveter flexing her muscle there.

06:14.500 --> 06:22.000
But the truth is, the truth is, men have bigger muscles than the cartoon lady,

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
and could beat her at an arm wrestling competition should one happen to break out, I suppose.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.500
So the consequence of this malicious, sentient form of feminism

06:32.500 --> 06:38.500
is that women today can be misled by World War II era inspirational work posters

06:38.500 --> 06:44.500
into falsely believing that they could beat men in an arm wrestling competition.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.000
Is that right there? Have I got that?

06:47.000 --> 06:51.500
So, anyway, since PragerU brought it up, let's talk about Rosie the Riveter.

06:51.500 --> 06:55.500
Now, Rosie the Riveter was a World War II cultural icon.

06:55.500 --> 07:01.500
Not designed, you might be surprised to hear, to convey women's muscular superiority to men,

07:01.500 --> 07:06.500
but as one of many government morale boosting campaigns aimed at encouraging women in the workforce,

07:06.500 --> 07:11.000
particularly women working in what were traditionally considered male roles.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Now, why, you might ask, did the government want to encourage women to join the workforce?

07:16.000 --> 07:21.500
Was it as part of some evil feminist campaign to attack masculinity and erode femininity?

07:21.500 --> 07:27.500
Well, no. You see, during World War II, there was a labor shortage,

07:27.500 --> 07:30.500
because a lot of the men had been conscripted into the armed forces,

07:30.500 --> 07:35.500
and so increasingly job openings in factories and the likes were filled by women.

07:35.500 --> 07:39.500
Women were encouraged to join the workforce to aid the war effort.

07:39.500 --> 07:45.000
That's why that was happening. You know, we can do it as in win the war,

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
not like overthrow men with our superior biceps or something.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.500
And I would have liked to see Andrew Clavin try to defend his ideas during World War II.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.500
You know, women shouldn't be working in factories. That's a male job.

07:59.500 --> 08:03.500
They should be home looking after the kids and being all feminine.

08:03.500 --> 08:08.500
And it's like, stop whining, Andrew. We've got to beat the Nazis here.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.000
There's no time for all your gender rubbish.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.500
So anyway, I was sufficiently blown away by this particular video that I decided to watch a few more.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.500
And here's my first impression of the channel.

08:19.500 --> 08:24.500
PragerU's boast of only needing five minutes to convey its ideas to you

08:24.500 --> 08:27.000
is actually being a little too generous there.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.500
I can tell you basically everything PragerU has to offer in a fraction of that time, so here goes.

08:33.500 --> 08:38.500
Firstly, feminism and other social justice causes are completely unnecessary,

08:38.500 --> 08:42.500
right up until the point at which we all agree they did something necessary,

08:42.500 --> 08:48.000
in which case the credit should go instead to Christian white men for allowing it to happen.

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
Secondly, capitalism is great and has absolutely no downsides, brackets, except for all the downsides,

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
which are actually the result of us not doing capitalism hard enough.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.500
Thirdly, no, that's about it, really. What did that take? 30 seconds?

09:04.500 --> 09:08.500
Now, to be fair, a few videos do fall outside those parameters there,

09:08.500 --> 09:11.000
but those two things are their bread and butter.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.500
Christian white men and capitalism are always good.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.500
Anyone who questions either of those things is always bad.

09:18.500 --> 09:22.500
And what I'm gonna do now is take a look at how PragerU expresses those ideas

09:22.500 --> 09:26.500
and see how fairly they represent any counterarguments.

09:26.500 --> 09:31.500
And not to give the game away here, but I did title my video How PragerU Lies to You.

09:31.500 --> 09:36.000
So, okay, first up is How PragerU Lies to You About Feminism.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
And we'll stick with Andrew Clavin's video Who Needs Feminism here for a little while,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.500
and let's read a little of the script.

09:42.500 --> 09:49.000
Now, perhaps you'll protest. Isn't feminism simply the idea that women have the same human rights as men?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.500
No. It isn't.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.500
That philosophy is called classical liberalism,

09:54.500 --> 09:57.500
which holds that we are all equally endowed by God

09:57.500 --> 10:02.000
with the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Now, this is just basic misrepresentation.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
Clavin anticipates the fact that he'll be called out on his biased definition of feminism,

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
and his answer to a hypothetical person presenting an alternative interpretation is...

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
No. No.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.500
You're wrong. I'm right. Only my definition is right, not yours.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.000
So there.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Which is not exactly advanced debate tactics, is it?

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
Clavin's only offered evidence to feminism not being about equality of the sexes

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
is that he claims that philosophy is called classical liberalism,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
which is silly all on its own,

10:40.000 --> 10:45.500
but implicit here is that a single idea cannot be shared between two political philosophies,

10:45.500 --> 10:47.500
which is ridiculous, obviously.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.500
Feminism could be about equality,

10:49.500 --> 10:53.000
and also classical liberalism could be about equality,

10:53.000 --> 10:58.500
because equality is not an idea that is singular to any one particular political movement.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.500
Later in his video, Clavin states,

11:00.500 --> 11:05.000
Feminism has developed the historical mythology that men have oppressed women,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.500
and now must be suppressed in their turn to even things out.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.000
More misrepresentation here.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
I'd just like to point out that not once in this video does Andrew Clavin quote a feminist,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.500
or cite any particular feminist theory or literature,

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
and this should be a red flag.

11:22.500 --> 11:30.000
Speaking personally here, I have never met any feminist who claims feminism is about suppressing men to even things out.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Mainly, I've met feminists who say feminism is about equality,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.500
but apparently they were all secretly classical liberalists or something.

11:38.500 --> 11:43.000
Andrew Clavin here is arguing against a straw-man version of feminism

11:43.000 --> 11:47.500
that only exists within the confines of his own imagination.

11:47.500 --> 11:53.000
He doesn't name who he's talking about either because they don't exist and he's just making it up,

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
or because he's scared he'll get a response from an actual real person with realistic ideas,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.500
and they're a lot harder to argue with than cartoon characters.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.500
Speaking of arguing with cartoon characters,

12:05.500 --> 12:08.500
in their video, Who Killed the Liberal Arts,

12:08.500 --> 12:13.000
which is one of many PragerU videos complaining about modern university campuses,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.500
we can see the following.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.500
There's some little cartoon professors there saying,

12:17.500 --> 12:23.500
We repudiate the great humanist tradition on which much of Western civilization

12:23.500 --> 12:27.500
and the Western university has been built.

12:27.500 --> 12:33.000
What a foolishly self-defeating quote there from anonymous cartoon professor number two.

12:33.500 --> 12:38.000
And later in the video, the cartoon professor really gives the game away when they say,

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
I seek only to confirm my own world view.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
It's quite a candid confession there,

12:44.000 --> 12:48.500
and it's handy these cartoon professors are so forward with their hypocrisies, isn't it?

12:48.500 --> 12:52.000
You know, given we've only got five minutes to argue against them.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.500
Returning to feminism here,

12:53.500 --> 12:59.000
I'd like to use two PragerU videos now to highlight a favorite little conservative contradiction of mine,

12:59.000 --> 13:02.500
and we're gonna look first at a video about the employment system,

13:02.500 --> 13:05.000
and then a video about the education system,

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
and pay particular attention to how gendered differences are described and accounted for.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.500
So first up is the video, There Is No Gender Wage Gap,

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
narrated by Christina Hoff Sommers,

13:15.500 --> 13:19.000
which comes to the conclusion that there is a gender wage gap.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.500
Let's take a look.

13:20.500 --> 13:26.000
Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization,

13:26.000 --> 13:30.500
shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents

13:30.500 --> 13:33.500
when you factor in different choices men and women make.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.000
And the key word here is choice.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
It has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.500
So okay, there is a gender wage gap despite the title of the video,

13:52.500 --> 13:58.500
but it's okay, because the gap is accounted for by the different choices that men and women make.

13:58.500 --> 14:03.000
Men and women are just fundamentally different and choose different careers,

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
and the result of the sum of those individual choices is that men get paid more.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.500
Changing the system to enforce equality here is entirely unnecessary.

14:12.500 --> 14:19.000
The system itself is neutral, and the discrepancy in outcomes is only down to individual choice.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
Right, so on to video two, titled War on Boys, also narrated by Christina Hoff Sommers,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.500
and let's take a look at that.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.500
Being a normal boy is a serious liability in today's classroom.

14:31.500 --> 14:36.000
Compared with girls, boys earn lower grades, they win fewer honors,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.500
they're far less likely to go to college.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.500
Boys are languishing academically while girls are prospering.

14:42.500 --> 14:49.000
In an ever more knowledge-based economy, this is not a recipe for a successful society.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
We need to start thinking about how we can make our grade school classrooms more boy-friendly.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.500
We need to reverse the boy-averse trends.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.500
Male underachievement is everyone's concern.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.000
Now I'm not sure I need to go through the second half of this argument here.

15:06.000 --> 15:13.000
I assume most of you have probably got it already, but for the one of you who missed it, here's the contradiction.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
When women are lagging behind men, for example in the wages they get paid, this is no problem whatsoever.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.500
It's just a natural result of men and women's biological differences.

15:23.500 --> 15:28.000
But when men are lagging behind women, such as receiving lower grades in school,

15:28.000 --> 15:35.500
well, that's everyone's concern, and we need to institute system-wide reforms in order to reverse the trend.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.500
And I like how biology is used here.

15:37.500 --> 15:41.500
It's presented as both the reason to preserve a system when men are ahead,

15:41.500 --> 15:45.500
and also as the reverse, to reform a system when men are behind.

15:45.500 --> 15:51.000
The message seems to be that any societal system should cater to male biological traits,

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
or at least conservatives' estimation of what male biological traits are.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
And we can have some fun here by reversing the argument in favor of girls,

16:00.000 --> 16:04.500
and maybe come up with some of our own flimsy evolutionary psychology too.

16:04.500 --> 16:08.500
So, okay, girls do better in schools, but that's fine.

16:08.500 --> 16:14.500
Whatever gap there is between boys and girls is entirely accounted for by the different choices they make.

16:14.500 --> 16:19.500
Girls are good listeners, good communicators, they're better at multitasking.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
This is just natural.

16:21.500 --> 16:27.500
If boys choose to spend their time playing outside instead of studying, then they're free to do that.

16:27.500 --> 16:31.500
But it would be unfair to expect equal grades for it.

16:31.500 --> 16:36.500
Anyway, let's move on now and examine PragerU's presentation of capitalism,

16:36.500 --> 16:39.000
which is a frequent topic in videos like

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
If You Hate Poverty, You Should Love Capitalism,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Why You Love Capitalism,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Is Capitalism Moral,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Why Capitalism Works, and so on.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Now, in these videos and others,

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
PragerU presents a, well, literally cartoonishly simple version of capitalism.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Let's take a look at the video Why Capitalism Works,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.500
which seeks to explain the basics of how businesses operate under capitalism.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.500
Now, they use the example of a flower shop.

17:06.500 --> 17:10.500
A newly opened flower shop can be run in different ways, you see.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.500
A selfish shop owner will put their needs before that of the customer,

17:14.500 --> 17:17.000
and thus will not make any profits.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Only businesses that satisfy their customers will succeed.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
Under capitalism, a business prospers only if customers voluntarily trade for its output.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Now, the majority of the time, this is how PragerU talks about capitalism.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
It's little cartoon people bumbling around, making cute, mutually beneficial transactions.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.500
You know, I have a quantity of money, a store has a product I desire,

17:41.500 --> 17:44.000
we trade those things and both profit.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.500
Hurrah.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.000
So, what do we think about this?

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
Well, first off, I'd like to highlight that they chose a flower store for their example,

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
rather than, say, a weapons developer, or a predatory loan lender,

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
or a fracking company, say.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.500
But since they picked a flower store, let's talk about that.

18:02.500 --> 18:06.000
So, some flower stores are good and successful,

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
and some flower stores are selfish and unsuccessful.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
They each make a series of mutually beneficial trades with customers,

18:13.000 --> 18:17.500
and naturally, the successful stores do better than the unsuccessful ones.

18:17.500 --> 18:21.000
And, what, the end?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
You know, we restart the simulation tomorrow.

18:24.000 --> 18:31.000
No, in actual reality, things continue happening after that, so let's carry on with the example.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
The successful flower store, after all their transactions, has built up some wealth.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
And if they build up enough wealth, they can start to influence the market outside of those simple, customer-level transactions.

18:43.000 --> 18:50.000
Let's say they purchase the unsuccessful flower store, and several others, and unite them all under the same brand.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.500
So now you've got Flower Corp.

18:52.500 --> 18:57.500
Now, Flower Corp, being a big business, will be sought after for big contracts.

18:57.500 --> 19:02.500
There will be competition to be the supplier of seeds, say, to Flower Corp.

19:02.500 --> 19:09.500
Flower Corp will be able to use its large market share as leverage to make beneficial deals with its suppliers,

19:09.500 --> 19:12.500
which will then mean they can cut costs on the consumer end,

19:12.500 --> 19:17.000
perhaps lower than it's possible for any startup business to compete with.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
This is one reason why big box stores kill off small local businesses, as well as, you know, convenience.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
They can afford to sell for less, because they buy for less, because they buy in bulk.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
So, Flower Corp starts pricing flower startups out of the market, and just to be sure,

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
maybe they open a Flower Corp store nearby any new flower businesses to divide their sales.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Now, let's see how far this metaphor can be stretched here.

19:44.000 --> 19:52.000
Let's say Flower Corp starts lobbying politicians to relax flower industry regulations and cut flower industry taxes,

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
and pretty soon, half the Senate is in the pockets of Big Flower.

19:56.000 --> 20:04.000
Let's say Flower Corp becomes so powerful that they're able to insert their executives into the staff of many of the country's most powerful politicians.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
Let's imagine their CEO becomes Vice President, even,

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
and starts pushing for a war with the Netherlands in order to install a puppet government

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
that will give their country cheap deals and all those fancy tulips they've got.

20:16.000 --> 20:24.000
Let's say a whole speculative flower market opens up, massively inflating the price of flowers until they cost more than a house.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
And a quick editorial note here, this one has actually happened in reality.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
And let's say that Flower Corp becomes so large that it becomes too big to fail,

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
so that when the flower bubble finally bursts, the government will step in and bail them out with public money.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
The government is staffed with their executives and funded by their lobbyists, after all.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
And finally, let's say that public opinion starts turning against Flower Corp and its various shady dealings,

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
and more generally, against the flawed system that allowed Flower Corp to cause so much damage.

20:58.000 --> 21:07.000
So, Flower Corp decides to fund a YouTube channel hosting videos that explain how they're actually great and can do no wrong.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
And there we are, there. We've caught back up to the present day.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
So, that's the saga of Flower Corp there.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
Now, in reality, all of those actions were carried out by the defense, oil, and financial industries,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
not the flower industry.

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
But how does PragerU, you might be wondering, account for all of those terrible happenings?

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
They were all a result of capitalist institutions acting in their own self-interest,

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
trying to increase their own profits, which is supposed to be beneficial for everyone, right?

21:38.000 --> 21:46.000
So, let's introduce the conservative cop-out answer for explaining away all the problems of capitalism.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
Crony capitalism. What is it? Why is it so bad?

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
To answer these questions, let's think about good old-fashioned capitalism.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
It is premised on the free exchange of goods or services between independent agents.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
Capitalism is moral because it is premised on a voluntary exchange between independent parties,

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
who agree to the deal only because it creates value for everybody.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
Crony capitalism is immoral because one of the parties, the government, has been bought off.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
Now, here I'd just like to remind you of this video I showed earlier.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Money and politics. What's the problem?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Well, here you go, PragerU. You've discovered it.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
So, crony capitalism, then.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
This is a concept PragerU talks about a few times and always in a particularly biased way.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
As you'll see, the government is always to blame.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
So, crony capitalism is unfair and immoral because the government has been bought off.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
But by who, though, you might be wondering?

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
Well, private interests. Should they share any of the blame?

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
Well, let's watch a brief clip from their video, The Speech Every 2015 College Grad Needs to Hear.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
Washington has produced a bubble in higher education just the way it produced the bubble in housing.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
Some government planners decided that too few people owned homes.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
So, the planners decided to force an increase in home ownership.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
They lowered lending standards for people seeking a mortgage.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
This produced a glut of subprime loans and subprime borrowers.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And then a crash.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
So, that was the housing market crash according to PragerU there.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
And let's just read through that one more time.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
Washington has produced a bubble in higher education just the way it produced the bubble in housing.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
Some government planners decided that too few people owned homes.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
So, the planners decided to force an increase in home ownership.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
Now, absent here is any mention of lobbying, naturally.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
Just silly government officials doing silly nonsense things for no reason.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
They lowered lending standards for people seeking a mortgage.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
And side note, we call that deregulation, which we're not allowed to say is a bad thing.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
So, we have to call it something else like lowered lending standards instead.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
This produced a glut of subprime loans and subprime borrowers and then a crash.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
So, this produced a glut of subprime loans.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
From who, though? Did they spring forth from the earth?

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
No, it was private institutions who were again being presented as blameless here.

24:26.000 --> 24:33.000
Only the government is at fault for not preventing the ill effects of the greed of the private sector.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
Greed which is excusable because working in your own self-interest is always good.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Unless you're a politician approached by a lobbyist with a suitcase full of money, of course.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
In which case, you're expected to ignore your own self-interest and only consider the public good.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
This is a racket.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
Capitalism is always perfect, except for when it isn't.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
In which case, it was the government's fault for not stopping it.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
And PragerU's solution to this problem is equally nonsensical.

25:03.000 --> 25:11.000
See, according to them, the private sector only lobbies and influences the government into doing bad things because the government is so big and powerful.

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
If we limit the government, then they won't want to control it as much apparently.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
Which is a bit like saying, if we just let the foxes into the henhouse, think of the money we'll save on fencing.

25:22.000 --> 25:30.000
Now, I'm gonna close out soon, but I can't go without giving a special mention to PragerU's use of graphs to illustrate their points.

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
We've already seen this one from the video, Why Capitalism Works, which is almost nonsense if you look at it for more than five seconds.

25:37.000 --> 25:51.000
Here's another good one from their video, Make Men Masculine Again, showing the masculine turning into the feminine over time, distance, temperature, who knows?

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
This one's from their video, Blacks in Power Don't Empower Blacks.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
Which apparently shows labor participation rates, but doesn't.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
You know, these are just two orange rectangles. There's no values on them.

26:06.000 --> 26:13.000
This one is from their video, Why is Modern Art So Bad, showing the quote, decline of artistic standards.

26:13.000 --> 26:20.000
Now, the vertical axis is at least labeled here with standards, which are measurable apparently.

26:21.000 --> 26:29.000
And they peaked just after 1850 and then declined until about 1970 there, until there were no more standards.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
There are no artistic standards anymore whatsoever.

26:33.000 --> 26:40.000
There's this one from their video, Hoover and the Great Depression, which shows industry with the economy lurking in the background there.

26:40.000 --> 26:50.000
And this one has two labels, Wage Rates, which are going down as layoffs are going up and getting dangerously close to that dark cloud there.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
I don't know what that's meant to signify, but it can't be good.

26:54.000 --> 27:03.000
Earlier in that video, we see this graph, Prices for Industrial Goods, which started out in 1929 at nearly three dollar signs there.

27:03.000 --> 27:13.000
Then prices fell to just two dollar signs throughout 1930, holding steady just long enough to underline the words, economy-wide deflation, which is handy.

27:13.000 --> 27:23.000
After that, there's more bad news, I'm afraid, with prices falling yet again, threatening to reach just one dollar sign, which as we know is the lowest possible price.

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
Now, anyone can make rubbish like this. I mean, look, here's one I made, for instance.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
What does this show? Happiness increasing as number of feminists increases, I guess.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Now, does this prove anything, this graph?

27:38.000 --> 27:44.000
And I'd just like to reiterate to any fans of PragerU who might be watching now, this is made up.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
Remember, I made this. Don't go around citing this.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
Now, you might say, Sean, picking on PragerU's graphs is unfair.

27:53.000 --> 28:00.000
They're not supposed to be real academic graphs. They're just little visual aids to complement what the speaker is talking about.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
They're not peer-reviewed or anything. And I would say to that, exactly.

28:05.000 --> 28:13.000
They're not real academic graphs, because this isn't a real academic institution. It's a YouTube channel.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
It can call itself whatever it likes, but a university it is not.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I might come back to PragerU at some point.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
A few of their videos seem possibly worthy of a more in-depth look, so we'll see about that.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
Let me know in the comments. Just kidding.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
I never read the comments. I'm not a masochist.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
I do read my curious cat questions, though, if you'd like to ask me a question on there.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
Now, before I go, I should mention here a couple of things that PragerU got right.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
Their video, Was the Civil War About Slavery?, is actually not bad.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
They do not come to the conclusion that you would expect them to come to.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
Also, PragerU get points from me for arguing against bailing out failing financial institutions,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
which I saw them do in a couple of videos.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
A lot of the time, conservatives will go on about the brilliant competition of the free market,

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
and then defend propping up failing banks with public money or something. It's highly hypocritical there.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
So credit to PragerU for avoiding doing that.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
Thanks, as always, to all my Patreon backers for supporting me in making videos like this.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
A link to my Patreon page is below, if you'd like to check that out.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
Right. Thanks, folks. I'll see you next time.
