0	6700	Hello, everyone. Now then, what would you say if I told you that I knew of a very generous Nigerian prince
6700	11000	who needed your help to move his fast riches out of his country?
11000	15500	Or what if I told you I could sell you a magic brain pill that will make you smarter?
15500	17500	Or, how about this one?
17500	23000	What if I told you that I could teach you an entire college course in just five minutes?
23500	28000	How would you like to learn a lot in a short amount of time?
28000	31500	A major infusion of knowledge in, say, five minutes?
31500	37500	And what if those five minutes distilled the best ideas from some of the best minds in the world?
37500	44000	Just as a shot of espresso boosts your energy, a shot of Prager University boosts your brain.
44000	47500	Because not only will you have more knowledge, you will have more wisdom.
47500	52500	If you think I'm exaggerating, there's an easy way to find out. Just watch a course.
53000	58500	That is Dennis Prager there, in a video titled, Welcome Prager University.
58500	63000	That's right, Prager University is an online university.
63000	69500	Now, I know it looks like just a YouTube channel and not a university, but it is. It is a university.
69500	75000	And I know the quote, courses, look like YouTube videos, but they're not.
75000	81500	They're real university courses taught by some of the quote, best minds in the world.
81500	84000	You can tell this because they come with study guides.
84000	88000	For example, here's the study guide for the video, Feminism 2.0,
88000	92000	which has sections to be filled in during and after watching the video,
92000	96500	discussion and review questions, and a quiz with questions like,
96500	102000	It is easy for feminists to forget that men A. Gave women the right to vote,
102000	110000	B. Gave up their monopoly on political power, C. Invented birth control, and D. All of the above.
110000	113500	Their answer, of course, being all of the above.
113500	118500	Now, the horrible reality suggested by these study guides is that there is someone somewhere in the world
118500	123500	homeschooling their children using these videos and, like, quizzing them on them afterwards,
123500	127500	which, you know, doesn't even bear thinking about, really, does it?
127500	135500	So, okay, Prager University is not a university. It's not an academic institution of any kind, actually.
135500	141000	It is a YouTube channel created by conservative talk show host, Dennis Prager,
141000	144500	and funded by the billionaire businessman, the Wilkes Brothers,
144500	150500	who got rich by creating a hydraulic fracking company called FracTech. Seriously.
150500	153500	So when you see PragerU videos with titles like,
153500	157500	Why You Should Love Fossil Fuel, well, that's why.
157500	162000	Now, the Wilkes Brothers also donate huge amounts of money to conservative politicians,
162000	167500	such as when they gave $15 million to a super PAC backing Ted Cruz in 2015.
167500	170500	So when you see PragerU videos with titles like,
170500	175000	Money in Politics, What's the Problem?, well, that's why.
175000	178000	Now, I feel like I've came out a little harshly here.
178000	185000	It'd be unfair, at this point, to just dismiss the whole channel as a biased conservative fantasy project
185000	189000	funded by two oil billionaires. So, let's back up a bit.
189000	191500	Why am I talking about PragerU today?
191500	197000	Well, you, like me, may have noticed PragerU's videos being promoted all over YouTube,
197000	201000	including sometimes on videos of mine and my lefty pals.
201000	205000	Now, that's because PragerU has an enormous annual budget
205000	208500	and spends a large proportion of that on advertising itself.
208500	213500	Anyway, I had mostly ignored these advertisements until fairly recently,
213500	218000	when, via a series of tragic misclicks, I ended up on this video.
218000	222000	Who Needs Feminism? featuring speaker Andrew Clavin,
222000	224500	which begins with Andrew Clavin stating,
224500	227000	I am an anti-feminist.
227000	230000	And let me show you what I saw after that.
230000	236000	Feminism denigrates masculinity in men by relentlessly calling us toxic for our flaws,
236000	241000	rather than appreciating our natural qualities of energy, risk-taking, and leadership.
241000	244000	But it also denigrates femininity in women,
244000	249000	working to replace most women's commitment to relationship and child-rearing with male obsessions,
249000	251500	such as career status and strength.
251500	253000	What's the result?
253000	258500	Take a look at the quintessential feminist icon, Rosie the Riveter, flexing her muscle.
258500	265000	The truth is, any man of the same size and fitness can make a bigger, stronger muscle than Rosie can.
265000	269500	Now, I feel like I could write a whole dissertation on the problems with these two paragraphs here,
269500	273500	but I'll just read through them now quickly and try to give you the short version.
273500	275000	So, here we go.
275000	278500	Feminism denigrates masculinity in men.
278500	280000	Now, hold on.
280000	282000	Here's the first problem.
282000	283500	No, it doesn't.
283500	286500	Feminism doesn't do anything independently.
286500	291000	It's not a monster that lives in a cave somewhere plotting against men.
291000	294500	You know, one person calling themselves a feminist might do that,
294500	297500	but other people calling themselves feminists will not.
297500	301500	Feminism is an idea with different interpretations.
301500	304000	It has no individual agency of its own,
304000	309000	and there's no supreme leader of feminism who sets the official feminism agenda.
309000	312000	Anyway, sorry, short version. Right.
312000	317500	Feminism denigrates masculinity in men by relentlessly calling us toxic for our flaws,
317500	322000	rather than appreciating our natural qualities of energy risk-taking and leadership.
322000	324000	So, you know, woe is me.
324000	328000	People are saying men are bad instead of saying they're good. How unfair.
328000	331000	But it also denigrates femininity in women,
331000	335500	working to replace most women's commitment to relationship and child-rearing
335500	339500	with male obsessions, such as career status and strength.
339500	343500	Now, again, feminism doesn't actually do either of those things.
343500	347500	What most feminists would probably take issue with in these two sentences
347500	354000	is Andrew Clavin claiming abstract concepts like energy are a natural quality of just one sex.
354000	358500	Which doesn't really make any sense, but whatever, let's get to the fun bit here.
358500	360500	Now then, what's all this about?
361000	365000	What's the result of, what, feminism?
365000	368000	Feminism's denigration of the sexes, I guess.
368000	374500	So, okay, the result of that is Rosie the Riveter flexing her muscle there.
374500	382000	But the truth is, the truth is, men have bigger muscles than the cartoon lady,
382000	388000	and could beat her at an arm wrestling competition should one happen to break out, I suppose.
388500	392500	So the consequence of this malicious, sentient form of feminism
392500	398500	is that women today can be misled by World War II era inspirational work posters
398500	404500	into falsely believing that they could beat men in an arm wrestling competition.
404500	407000	Is that right there? Have I got that?
407000	411500	So, anyway, since PragerU brought it up, let's talk about Rosie the Riveter.
411500	415500	Now, Rosie the Riveter was a World War II cultural icon.
415500	421500	Not designed, you might be surprised to hear, to convey women's muscular superiority to men,
421500	426500	but as one of many government morale boosting campaigns aimed at encouraging women in the workforce,
426500	431000	particularly women working in what were traditionally considered male roles.
431000	436000	Now, why, you might ask, did the government want to encourage women to join the workforce?
436000	441500	Was it as part of some evil feminist campaign to attack masculinity and erode femininity?
441500	447500	Well, no. You see, during World War II, there was a labor shortage,
447500	450500	because a lot of the men had been conscripted into the armed forces,
450500	455500	and so increasingly job openings in factories and the likes were filled by women.
455500	459500	Women were encouraged to join the workforce to aid the war effort.
459500	465000	That's why that was happening. You know, we can do it as in win the war,
465000	470000	not like overthrow men with our superior biceps or something.
470000	475500	And I would have liked to see Andrew Clavin try to defend his ideas during World War II.
475500	479500	You know, women shouldn't be working in factories. That's a male job.
479500	483500	They should be home looking after the kids and being all feminine.
483500	488500	And it's like, stop whining, Andrew. We've got to beat the Nazis here.
488500	491000	There's no time for all your gender rubbish.
491000	496500	So anyway, I was sufficiently blown away by this particular video that I decided to watch a few more.
496500	499500	And here's my first impression of the channel.
499500	504500	PragerU's boast of only needing five minutes to convey its ideas to you
504500	507000	is actually being a little too generous there.
507000	513500	I can tell you basically everything PragerU has to offer in a fraction of that time, so here goes.
513500	518500	Firstly, feminism and other social justice causes are completely unnecessary,
518500	522500	right up until the point at which we all agree they did something necessary,
522500	528000	in which case the credit should go instead to Christian white men for allowing it to happen.
528000	535000	Secondly, capitalism is great and has absolutely no downsides, brackets, except for all the downsides,
535000	539000	which are actually the result of us not doing capitalism hard enough.
539000	544500	Thirdly, no, that's about it, really. What did that take? 30 seconds?
544500	548500	Now, to be fair, a few videos do fall outside those parameters there,
548500	551000	but those two things are their bread and butter.
551000	554500	Christian white men and capitalism are always good.
555000	558500	Anyone who questions either of those things is always bad.
558500	562500	And what I'm gonna do now is take a look at how PragerU expresses those ideas
562500	566500	and see how fairly they represent any counterarguments.
566500	571500	And not to give the game away here, but I did title my video How PragerU Lies to You.
571500	576000	So, okay, first up is How PragerU Lies to You About Feminism.
576000	580000	And we'll stick with Andrew Clavin's video Who Needs Feminism here for a little while,
580000	582500	and let's read a little of the script.
582500	589000	Now, perhaps you'll protest. Isn't feminism simply the idea that women have the same human rights as men?
589000	591500	No. It isn't.
591500	594500	That philosophy is called classical liberalism,
594500	597500	which holds that we are all equally endowed by God
597500	602000	with the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
602000	605000	Now, this is just basic misrepresentation.
605000	610000	Clavin anticipates the fact that he'll be called out on his biased definition of feminism,
610000	615000	and his answer to a hypothetical person presenting an alternative interpretation is...
615000	618000	No. No.
618000	623500	You're wrong. I'm right. Only my definition is right, not yours.
623500	625000	So there.
625000	629000	Which is not exactly advanced debate tactics, is it?
629000	634000	Clavin's only offered evidence to feminism not being about equality of the sexes
634000	638000	is that he claims that philosophy is called classical liberalism,
638000	640000	which is silly all on its own,
640000	645500	but implicit here is that a single idea cannot be shared between two political philosophies,
645500	647500	which is ridiculous, obviously.
647500	649500	Feminism could be about equality,
649500	653000	and also classical liberalism could be about equality,
653000	658500	because equality is not an idea that is singular to any one particular political movement.
658500	660500	Later in his video, Clavin states,
660500	665000	Feminism has developed the historical mythology that men have oppressed women,
665000	669500	and now must be suppressed in their turn to even things out.
669500	672000	More misrepresentation here.
672000	677000	I'd just like to point out that not once in this video does Andrew Clavin quote a feminist,
677000	680500	or cite any particular feminist theory or literature,
680500	682500	and this should be a red flag.
682500	690000	Speaking personally here, I have never met any feminist who claims feminism is about suppressing men to even things out.
690000	694000	Mainly, I've met feminists who say feminism is about equality,
694000	698500	but apparently they were all secretly classical liberalists or something.
698500	703000	Andrew Clavin here is arguing against a straw-man version of feminism
703000	707500	that only exists within the confines of his own imagination.
707500	713000	He doesn't name who he's talking about either because they don't exist and he's just making it up,
713000	719000	or because he's scared he'll get a response from an actual real person with realistic ideas,
719000	722500	and they're a lot harder to argue with than cartoon characters.
722500	725500	Speaking of arguing with cartoon characters,
725500	728500	in their video, Who Killed the Liberal Arts,
728500	733000	which is one of many PragerU videos complaining about modern university campuses,
733000	734500	we can see the following.
734500	737500	There's some little cartoon professors there saying,
737500	743500	We repudiate the great humanist tradition on which much of Western civilization
743500	747500	and the Western university has been built.
747500	753000	What a foolishly self-defeating quote there from anonymous cartoon professor number two.
753500	758000	And later in the video, the cartoon professor really gives the game away when they say,
758000	762000	I seek only to confirm my own world view.
762000	764000	It's quite a candid confession there,
764000	768500	and it's handy these cartoon professors are so forward with their hypocrisies, isn't it?
768500	772000	You know, given we've only got five minutes to argue against them.
772000	773500	Returning to feminism here,
773500	779000	I'd like to use two PragerU videos now to highlight a favorite little conservative contradiction of mine,
779000	782500	and we're gonna look first at a video about the employment system,
782500	785000	and then a video about the education system,
785000	790000	and pay particular attention to how gendered differences are described and accounted for.
790000	793500	So first up is the video, There Is No Gender Wage Gap,
793500	795500	narrated by Christina Hoff Sommers,
795500	799000	which comes to the conclusion that there is a gender wage gap.
799000	800500	Let's take a look.
800500	806000	Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization,
806000	810500	shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents
810500	813500	when you factor in different choices men and women make.
813500	816000	And the key word here is choice.
816000	822000	The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism.
822000	828000	It has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make.
828000	832500	So okay, there is a gender wage gap despite the title of the video,
832500	838500	but it's okay, because the gap is accounted for by the different choices that men and women make.
838500	843000	Men and women are just fundamentally different and choose different careers,
843000	848000	and the result of the sum of those individual choices is that men get paid more.
848000	852500	Changing the system to enforce equality here is entirely unnecessary.
852500	859000	The system itself is neutral, and the discrepancy in outcomes is only down to individual choice.
859000	866000	Right, so on to video two, titled War on Boys, also narrated by Christina Hoff Sommers,
866000	867500	and let's take a look at that.
867500	871500	Being a normal boy is a serious liability in today's classroom.
871500	876000	Compared with girls, boys earn lower grades, they win fewer honors,
876000	878500	they're far less likely to go to college.
878500	882500	Boys are languishing academically while girls are prospering.
882500	889000	In an ever more knowledge-based economy, this is not a recipe for a successful society.
889000	895000	We need to start thinking about how we can make our grade school classrooms more boy-friendly.
895000	899500	We need to reverse the boy-averse trends.
899500	902500	Male underachievement is everyone's concern.
902500	906000	Now I'm not sure I need to go through the second half of this argument here.
906000	913000	I assume most of you have probably got it already, but for the one of you who missed it, here's the contradiction.
913000	919000	When women are lagging behind men, for example in the wages they get paid, this is no problem whatsoever.
919000	923500	It's just a natural result of men and women's biological differences.
923500	928000	But when men are lagging behind women, such as receiving lower grades in school,
928000	935500	well, that's everyone's concern, and we need to institute system-wide reforms in order to reverse the trend.
935500	937500	And I like how biology is used here.
937500	941500	It's presented as both the reason to preserve a system when men are ahead,
941500	945500	and also as the reverse, to reform a system when men are behind.
945500	951000	The message seems to be that any societal system should cater to male biological traits,
951000	956000	or at least conservatives' estimation of what male biological traits are.
956000	960000	And we can have some fun here by reversing the argument in favor of girls,
960000	964500	and maybe come up with some of our own flimsy evolutionary psychology too.
964500	968500	So, okay, girls do better in schools, but that's fine.
968500	974500	Whatever gap there is between boys and girls is entirely accounted for by the different choices they make.
974500	979500	Girls are good listeners, good communicators, they're better at multitasking.
979500	981500	This is just natural.
981500	987500	If boys choose to spend their time playing outside instead of studying, then they're free to do that.
987500	991500	But it would be unfair to expect equal grades for it.
991500	996500	Anyway, let's move on now and examine PragerU's presentation of capitalism,
996500	999000	which is a frequent topic in videos like
999000	1002000	If You Hate Poverty, You Should Love Capitalism,
1002000	1004000	Why You Love Capitalism,
1004000	1006000	Is Capitalism Moral,
1006000	1008000	Why Capitalism Works, and so on.
1008000	1010000	Now, in these videos and others,
1010000	1016000	PragerU presents a, well, literally cartoonishly simple version of capitalism.
1016000	1019000	Let's take a look at the video Why Capitalism Works,
1019000	1023500	which seeks to explain the basics of how businesses operate under capitalism.
1023500	1026500	Now, they use the example of a flower shop.
1026500	1030500	A newly opened flower shop can be run in different ways, you see.
1030500	1034500	A selfish shop owner will put their needs before that of the customer,
1034500	1037000	and thus will not make any profits.
1037000	1041000	Only businesses that satisfy their customers will succeed.
1041000	1047000	Under capitalism, a business prospers only if customers voluntarily trade for its output.
1047000	1051000	Now, the majority of the time, this is how PragerU talks about capitalism.
1051000	1057000	It's little cartoon people bumbling around, making cute, mutually beneficial transactions.
1057000	1061500	You know, I have a quantity of money, a store has a product I desire,
1061500	1064000	we trade those things and both profit.
1064000	1065500	Hurrah.
1065500	1067000	So, what do we think about this?
1067000	1071000	Well, first off, I'd like to highlight that they chose a flower store for their example,
1071000	1076000	rather than, say, a weapons developer, or a predatory loan lender,
1076000	1079000	or a fracking company, say.
1079000	1082500	But since they picked a flower store, let's talk about that.
1082500	1086000	So, some flower stores are good and successful,
1086000	1089000	and some flower stores are selfish and unsuccessful.
1089000	1093000	They each make a series of mutually beneficial trades with customers,
1093000	1097500	and naturally, the successful stores do better than the unsuccessful ones.
1097500	1101000	And, what, the end?
1101000	1104000	You know, we restart the simulation tomorrow.
1104000	1111000	No, in actual reality, things continue happening after that, so let's carry on with the example.
1111000	1116000	The successful flower store, after all their transactions, has built up some wealth.
1116000	1123000	And if they build up enough wealth, they can start to influence the market outside of those simple, customer-level transactions.
1123000	1130000	Let's say they purchase the unsuccessful flower store, and several others, and unite them all under the same brand.
1130000	1132500	So now you've got Flower Corp.
1132500	1137500	Now, Flower Corp, being a big business, will be sought after for big contracts.
1137500	1142500	There will be competition to be the supplier of seeds, say, to Flower Corp.
1142500	1149500	Flower Corp will be able to use its large market share as leverage to make beneficial deals with its suppliers,
1149500	1152500	which will then mean they can cut costs on the consumer end,
1152500	1157000	perhaps lower than it's possible for any startup business to compete with.
1157000	1164000	This is one reason why big box stores kill off small local businesses, as well as, you know, convenience.
1164000	1169000	They can afford to sell for less, because they buy for less, because they buy in bulk.
1169000	1175000	So, Flower Corp starts pricing flower startups out of the market, and just to be sure,
1175000	1181000	maybe they open a Flower Corp store nearby any new flower businesses to divide their sales.
1181000	1184000	Now, let's see how far this metaphor can be stretched here.
1184000	1192000	Let's say Flower Corp starts lobbying politicians to relax flower industry regulations and cut flower industry taxes,
1192000	1196000	and pretty soon, half the Senate is in the pockets of Big Flower.
1196000	1204000	Let's say Flower Corp becomes so powerful that they're able to insert their executives into the staff of many of the country's most powerful politicians.
1204000	1208000	Let's imagine their CEO becomes Vice President, even,
1208000	1212000	and starts pushing for a war with the Netherlands in order to install a puppet government
1212000	1216000	that will give their country cheap deals and all those fancy tulips they've got.
1216000	1224000	Let's say a whole speculative flower market opens up, massively inflating the price of flowers until they cost more than a house.
1224000	1229000	And a quick editorial note here, this one has actually happened in reality.
1229000	1234000	And let's say that Flower Corp becomes so large that it becomes too big to fail,
1234000	1240000	so that when the flower bubble finally bursts, the government will step in and bail them out with public money.
1240000	1246000	The government is staffed with their executives and funded by their lobbyists, after all.
1246000	1253000	And finally, let's say that public opinion starts turning against Flower Corp and its various shady dealings,
1253000	1258000	and more generally, against the flawed system that allowed Flower Corp to cause so much damage.
1258000	1267000	So, Flower Corp decides to fund a YouTube channel hosting videos that explain how they're actually great and can do no wrong.
1267000	1271000	And there we are, there. We've caught back up to the present day.
1271000	1274000	So, that's the saga of Flower Corp there.
1274000	1280000	Now, in reality, all of those actions were carried out by the defense, oil, and financial industries,
1280000	1282000	not the flower industry.
1282000	1288000	But how does PragerU, you might be wondering, account for all of those terrible happenings?
1288000	1293000	They were all a result of capitalist institutions acting in their own self-interest,
1293000	1298000	trying to increase their own profits, which is supposed to be beneficial for everyone, right?
1298000	1306000	So, let's introduce the conservative cop-out answer for explaining away all the problems of capitalism.
1306000	1311000	Crony capitalism. What is it? Why is it so bad?
1311000	1315000	To answer these questions, let's think about good old-fashioned capitalism.
1315000	1320000	It is premised on the free exchange of goods or services between independent agents.
1320000	1326000	Capitalism is moral because it is premised on a voluntary exchange between independent parties,
1326000	1330000	who agree to the deal only because it creates value for everybody.
1330000	1336000	Crony capitalism is immoral because one of the parties, the government, has been bought off.
1336000	1340000	Now, here I'd just like to remind you of this video I showed earlier.
1340000	1343000	Money and politics. What's the problem?
1343000	1346000	Well, here you go, PragerU. You've discovered it.
1346000	1348000	So, crony capitalism, then.
1348000	1354000	This is a concept PragerU talks about a few times and always in a particularly biased way.
1354000	1358000	As you'll see, the government is always to blame.
1358000	1364000	So, crony capitalism is unfair and immoral because the government has been bought off.
1364000	1367000	But by who, though, you might be wondering?
1367000	1371000	Well, private interests. Should they share any of the blame?
1371000	1377000	Well, let's watch a brief clip from their video, The Speech Every 2015 College Grad Needs to Hear.
1377000	1383000	Washington has produced a bubble in higher education just the way it produced the bubble in housing.
1383000	1388000	Some government planners decided that too few people owned homes.
1388000	1393000	So, the planners decided to force an increase in home ownership.
1393000	1396000	They lowered lending standards for people seeking a mortgage.
1397000	1402000	This produced a glut of subprime loans and subprime borrowers.
1402000	1404000	And then a crash.
1404000	1408000	So, that was the housing market crash according to PragerU there.
1408000	1410000	And let's just read through that one more time.
1410000	1416000	Washington has produced a bubble in higher education just the way it produced the bubble in housing.
1416000	1420000	Some government planners decided that too few people owned homes.
1420000	1424000	So, the planners decided to force an increase in home ownership.
1424000	1427000	Now, absent here is any mention of lobbying, naturally.
1427000	1432000	Just silly government officials doing silly nonsense things for no reason.
1432000	1436000	They lowered lending standards for people seeking a mortgage.
1436000	1441000	And side note, we call that deregulation, which we're not allowed to say is a bad thing.
1441000	1446000	So, we have to call it something else like lowered lending standards instead.
1446000	1451000	This produced a glut of subprime loans and subprime borrowers and then a crash.
1451000	1455000	So, this produced a glut of subprime loans.
1455000	1460000	From who, though? Did they spring forth from the earth?
1460000	1466000	No, it was private institutions who were again being presented as blameless here.
1466000	1473000	Only the government is at fault for not preventing the ill effects of the greed of the private sector.
1473000	1478000	Greed which is excusable because working in your own self-interest is always good.
1478000	1483000	Unless you're a politician approached by a lobbyist with a suitcase full of money, of course.
1483000	1489000	In which case, you're expected to ignore your own self-interest and only consider the public good.
1489000	1491000	This is a racket.
1491000	1495000	Capitalism is always perfect, except for when it isn't.
1495000	1499000	In which case, it was the government's fault for not stopping it.
1499000	1503000	And PragerU's solution to this problem is equally nonsensical.
1503000	1511000	See, according to them, the private sector only lobbies and influences the government into doing bad things because the government is so big and powerful.
1511000	1516000	If we limit the government, then they won't want to control it as much apparently.
1516000	1522000	Which is a bit like saying, if we just let the foxes into the henhouse, think of the money we'll save on fencing.
1522000	1530000	Now, I'm gonna close out soon, but I can't go without giving a special mention to PragerU's use of graphs to illustrate their points.
1530000	1537000	We've already seen this one from the video, Why Capitalism Works, which is almost nonsense if you look at it for more than five seconds.
1537000	1551000	Here's another good one from their video, Make Men Masculine Again, showing the masculine turning into the feminine over time, distance, temperature, who knows?
1551000	1557000	This one's from their video, Blacks in Power Don't Empower Blacks.
1557000	1562000	Which apparently shows labor participation rates, but doesn't.
1562000	1566000	You know, these are just two orange rectangles. There's no values on them.
1566000	1573000	This one is from their video, Why is Modern Art So Bad, showing the quote, decline of artistic standards.
1573000	1580000	Now, the vertical axis is at least labeled here with standards, which are measurable apparently.
1581000	1589000	And they peaked just after 1850 and then declined until about 1970 there, until there were no more standards.
1589000	1593000	There are no artistic standards anymore whatsoever.
1593000	1600000	There's this one from their video, Hoover and the Great Depression, which shows industry with the economy lurking in the background there.
1600000	1610000	And this one has two labels, Wage Rates, which are going down as layoffs are going up and getting dangerously close to that dark cloud there.
1610000	1614000	I don't know what that's meant to signify, but it can't be good.
1614000	1623000	Earlier in that video, we see this graph, Prices for Industrial Goods, which started out in 1929 at nearly three dollar signs there.
1623000	1633000	Then prices fell to just two dollar signs throughout 1930, holding steady just long enough to underline the words, economy-wide deflation, which is handy.
1633000	1643000	After that, there's more bad news, I'm afraid, with prices falling yet again, threatening to reach just one dollar sign, which as we know is the lowest possible price.
1643000	1649000	Now, anyone can make rubbish like this. I mean, look, here's one I made, for instance.
1650000	1655000	What does this show? Happiness increasing as number of feminists increases, I guess.
1655000	1658000	Now, does this prove anything, this graph?
1658000	1664000	And I'd just like to reiterate to any fans of PragerU who might be watching now, this is made up.
1664000	1668000	Remember, I made this. Don't go around citing this.
1668000	1673000	Now, you might say, Sean, picking on PragerU's graphs is unfair.
1673000	1680000	They're not supposed to be real academic graphs. They're just little visual aids to complement what the speaker is talking about.
1680000	1685000	They're not peer-reviewed or anything. And I would say to that, exactly.
1685000	1693000	They're not real academic graphs, because this isn't a real academic institution. It's a YouTube channel.
1693000	1698000	It can call itself whatever it likes, but a university it is not.
1698000	1700000	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1700000	1702000	I might come back to PragerU at some point.
1702000	1707000	A few of their videos seem possibly worthy of a more in-depth look, so we'll see about that.
1707000	1710000	Let me know in the comments. Just kidding.
1710000	1713000	I never read the comments. I'm not a masochist.
1713000	1717000	I do read my curious cat questions, though, if you'd like to ask me a question on there.
1717000	1722000	Now, before I go, I should mention here a couple of things that PragerU got right.
1722000	1727000	Their video, Was the Civil War About Slavery?, is actually not bad.
1727000	1731000	They do not come to the conclusion that you would expect them to come to.
1731000	1737000	Also, PragerU get points from me for arguing against bailing out failing financial institutions,
1737000	1739000	which I saw them do in a couple of videos.
1739000	1744000	A lot of the time, conservatives will go on about the brilliant competition of the free market,
1744000	1750000	and then defend propping up failing banks with public money or something. It's highly hypocritical there.
1750000	1753000	So credit to PragerU for avoiding doing that.
1753000	1758000	Thanks, as always, to all my Patreon backers for supporting me in making videos like this.
1758000	1761000	A link to my Patreon page is below, if you'd like to check that out.
1761000	1764000	Right. Thanks, folks. I'll see you next time.
