0	1360	Hello, everyone.
1360	4900	So, today, we're gonna be talking about a map.
4900	9600	A map of Germany, with a bunch of coloured pins all over it.
10100	15600	And this is a map I've seen crop up in a few different places on the internet.
15600	19600	For example, here it is in a Black Pigeon Speaks video.
20600	25300	Here's someone pretending to be a kangaroo while talking about it.
25300	28000	I don't really know what's happening there.
28000	35100	And it also shows up in the videos of definitely not racist German person, Kraut and T.
35100	39300	And let's give him the honour of explaining what this map is.
39300	40600	Let me show you something.
40600	44200	This here is a Twitter account called X-Ipsilon-Einselfall.
44200	47600	All it does is tweet out confirmed cases of migrant crime,
47600	51600	then creates a dot and places that dot on a map of Germany.
51600	54800	Seven months ago, this is what the map looked like.
54800	56800	Well, this is what it looks like today.
57400	60900	No, you're not looking at a coloured-out picture of Germany.
60900	65300	This is a representation of migrant crime here over the course of the last year,
65300	67800	since the migrant and refugee crisis.
67800	74100	So, this map shows confirmed instances of migrant or refugee crime.
74100	77800	Confirmed. Just remember that word.
77800	79400	Just in case.
79400	86100	So, this map has been put together by Facebook group X-Y-Einselfall.
86100	89200	And it's not a racial thing, obviously.
89200	95200	They're just concerned with documenting refugee and migrant crime, and nothing else.
95200	98700	Race has nothing to do with it.
98700	105000	Except, well, I'm what we call a rational skeptic here on YouTube,
105000	109500	and I've come up with an alternative hypothesis.
109600	117000	What if this map isn't really about documenting only confirmed cases of migrant and refugee crime,
117000	123800	and is instead really about making a scary-looking map to frighten people into being racist?
123800	128200	Now, that might sound crazy, I know, but it's a possibility, isn't it?
128200	132200	So, how do we go about proving or disproving this theory?
132200	139900	Well, what we're gonna have to do is have a closer look at this map and the sources contained thereupon.
139900	146500	And there are different sections on this map for theft, arson, terror attacks, sexual assault, and so on,
146500	149300	and we're gonna be looking at a few of these sections.
149300	155400	We're gonna take a look at the sources and see if these are actually confirmed migrant crimes,
155400	159200	or, instead, a load of old bollocks.
159200	162100	So, firstly, I have to mention duplicates.
162100	166600	Now, some of these pins are for the same incidents, I'm sorry to say.
166600	172200	For example, these two arson pins in Hanover point to the same news story,
172200	178200	and these three terror pins in Dusseldorf also point to the same news story.
178200	184600	And these two other terror pins, also in Dusseldorf, also point to the same news story.
184600	187800	And if you look deeper into that particular news story, actually,
187800	193400	you'll see the suspects, in that case, are German nationals, not refugees.
193400	197000	Dortfahafften sie den Deutschen convertiten Sebastian B.
197000	202800	Der vorwöf mit glietschaft in der zur Zeitwohl brutalsten terroristischen Varenigung.
202800	206600	And actually, if we look even deeper into this news story,
206600	214800	we'll see that the map links to a page describing Sebastian B's sentencing in April of 2016,
214800	218600	but he was actually arrested in early 2015.
218600	223600	So, if we're looking for confirmed cases of migrant crime in 2016,
223600	230400	well, this wasn't a migrant, it was a German guy, and the crime didn't even take place in 2016.
230400	233600	And this is on the map multiple times.
233600	237200	And to be honest, I consider this map busted right here, you know?
237200	241200	It's over, this map is bullshit, clearly, but...
241400	249800	You know, since we're here anyway, we may as well put the work in and kick it while it's down for another, say, 15 minutes.
249800	254200	You see, this map is not based on any police or government statistics.
254200	261400	It is a civilian group, I believe comprised of multiple people collecting news stories and police reports,
261400	265000	none of whom seem too interested in checking for duplicates.
265000	272200	So, keep in mind when you look at this map, a lot of these pins are actually separate instances of the same crime.
272200	275600	So anyway, first off, let's take a look at arson.
275600	284400	The horrible crime of arson, intentionally setting fire to things with the intent to cause damage.
284400	291200	Now, there are a bit over 100 arson cases on this map, so let's have a look at a few.
291200	294600	Here's one in Duisburg.
294600	299400	In July, in Duisburg, saying that wrong,
299400	306800	some trash was set on fire in an uninhabited building by an unknown suspect he's described as very thin,
306800	311600	35 to 45 years old, and as having dark skin.
311600	315200	So that's arson, but is he a migrant?
315200	320000	He wasn't arrested, and the police don't know who he is, so he could be anyone.
320000	323800	There's no mention of him being a refugee or a migrant.
323800	329200	He could have been born in Germany, who knows, but that's just one pin.
329200	331600	Another one in Soltau.
331600	335000	Some teenagers set a fire in the woods.
335000	337800	They're between 13 and 15 years old.
337800	342800	Southeastern European look, apparently, but again, they weren't caught.
342800	347800	So there's no way to know if they're migrants or refugees, or neither.
347800	355200	Whoever included this pin on the map is just assuming that they're refugees based upon their described skin color.
355200	363400	In this case, in Schneeberg, a refugee home had to be evacuated because of a triggered fire detector.
363400	367000	But there's no indication there was actually a fire.
367000	373200	In this case, in Wendlingen, I am butchering the names of these German towns, I'm sorry,
373200	378600	a refugee burned some toast and set the toaster on fire.
378600	383600	Now, nobody was hurt, but there was a lot of smoke.
383600	394200	Now, is a small accidental cooking fire that injures nobody and causes minimal damage really worthy of being called arson?
394200	398600	I mean, we've all burned toast before, haven't we?
398600	402600	You know, my dad once set the cooker on fire making bacon.
402600	405000	Is he an arsonist?
405000	411400	You know, I'm having kind of a hard time being afraid of this refugee and his burnt toast.
411400	416200	Now, before I'm accused of cherry-picking a few examples out of the entire map here,
416200	425000	I have went through every single one of these so-called arson cases on the map, so cue the music.
425120	431000	A cooking fire, a cooking fire, a cooking fire.
431000	435600	Another cooking fire, another cooking fire.
435600	440120	Firecrackers set off a fire alarm accidentally.
440120	444000	A cooking fire, another cooking fire.
444000	451880	Improper disposal of a cigarette, another cooking fire, another cooking fire, another cigarette.
451880	457280	Improper use of candles, no injuries there, amazingly.
457280	461280	Another cooking fire, another cooking fire.
461280	467480	There was an accident in a kitchen when someone was cooking that caused a small fire.
467480	471280	Another cooking fire, a possible electrical fault.
471280	476080	Imagine that, that's awesome now apparently, electrical fault.
476080	483280	Another cooking fire, another cigarette, improper usage of a candle, again.
483280	491680	Another cooking fire, improper disposal of wood embers, and a bunch more cooking fires.
491680	495680	Lastly, I'd like to look at my favorite cooking fire story.
495680	503480	A Syrian in Ovenstad left a pot on the stove and it went on fire.
503480	509680	And the reason this is my favorite one of these stories is because there's a picture of the offending pot.
509680	514680	Um, I guess not much happens in Ovenstad generally.
514680	522680	Now actually, almost half the pins in this map are for fires that were either started accidentally or have unknown causes.
522680	530880	And remember, some of those intentional fires were started by people who are not known to be immigrants or refugees because they weren't caught.
530880	535480	They were just started by people who witnesses say were not white.
535480	543480	And if we look at the arrest statistics here, we see that more than half of the news stories on this map make no mention of an arrest taking place,
543480	548280	either because the fire was accidental or because the suspect is unknown.
548280	556080	So how many pins on this map are news stories about a refugee or migrant actually being convicted of arson?
556080	558880	Well, you can count them on one hand.
558880	567280	The problem for the XY Einzelfall people, though, is that this doesn't look as scary as this, does it?
568280	570880	Well, maybe if we scroll out far enough...
570880	573880	Oh God, look! Germany's on fire!
574280	578280	So anyway, let's take a look at robberies and thefts.
578280	586080	Now, there are 5,500 sources here and my German is absolutely rubbish.
586080	591480	So, if I looked at all of these sources, I would still be making this video next year.
591480	597280	So, I decided to take a look at the first 50 sources as a representative example.
597880	599280	And let's look at a couple.
599280	606080	In Düsseldorf, in February, an 88-year-old's handbag was stolen by a thief.
606480	611280	He was 20 to 30 years old, dressed in dark, and had a dark skin colour.
611480	616480	He was not apprehended, and there's absolutely no way to know his migrant status.
617280	624280	Again, maybe he was born in Germany. Maybe he migrated to Germany 20 years ago. Who knows?
624680	628280	And this is something you see time and time again on the map.
628280	635480	Suspects are described as having dark skin, or a southern appearance, or a Mediterranean appearance,
635480	642880	or a Latin appearance, with no other identifying information that could tell us if they're actually refugees.
643080	650680	The XY Einzelfall Group is just making the assumption that all non-white criminals are not German.
650880	657480	Even in cases like the following from Hamburg, now the suspect here is described as being a southerner,
657480	661080	but also as speaking German without an accent.
661280	666280	Now, speaking German without an accent would suggest to me that he's not a refugee or a migrant,
666280	672280	or at least not a recent one, but regardless, it's marked down here as a migrant crime.
672480	681680	Of the 50 pins I looked at here, only five connected to news stories in which the suspect's status as a migrant or refugee was confirmed.
682080	688880	The other 45 were all speculative, and based only on physical descriptions of the suspect.
689280	695880	So at this point in my source checking, I was starting to get the feeling that the XY Einzelfall people that made the map
695880	699680	weren't really interested in migrant crime or refugee crime.
700080	703880	What this is really about, it seems, is non-white crime.
704280	711480	And it's hard to argue with this when we look at stories like the following one from Hanover, and this is one of the murder pins.
711880	719280	A suspect named as Ali Kemal S was wanted for the murder of a woman in Istanbul in Turkey.
719280	723280	Now, the suspect in this case is from Hanover in Germany.
723680	730080	He is a German national, and he allegedly killed someone in Turkey, a foreign country.
730480	740080	And this is marked down as a migrant murder on the map, and I guess, you know, kinda, but isn't that cheating a little bit, guys?
740480	747080	You know, migrant crime. German migrants going to other countries and murdering people, you know.
747880	752880	Anyway, enough nibbling around the edges here, let's get into the meat of it.
752880	757680	The terror pins for all the terrible terrorism.
758480	763480	All these pins are there for acts of terror, so let's look at a few.
764080	768280	So, in July, in Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe?
768680	773680	A German national was arrested for online support of the Islamic State.
774080	780880	Now, in what sense is this a migrant or refugee crime? That's a German guy supporting the Islamic State.
781280	783880	Why is that being blamed on refugees?
784280	789280	Next up, Eisenhundstadt, Jesus Christ.
789880	794480	A German man was said to have explosives and be planning a terror attack.
794680	801880	Police raided his house and found no evidence of him planning a terror attack, no Islamist material or explosive material.
802480	805280	Although he did have two firecrackers.
805280	810280	Now, that's not a terror attack. It's not even a planned terror attack.
810280	816880	What this news story says, essentially, is a native German man owns two firecrackers.
817080	820680	And that's marked on the map as a refugee terror attack.
820680	826680	And, again, before I'm accused of cherry-picking here, I looked at every terror pin on this map.
827280	834280	And first off, a lot of the pins here are for crimes that did not actually take place in 2016.
834280	838080	There's a lot of cases of suspects being arrested in Germany
838480	843480	for crimes that have taken place in other countries, often in previous years.
843480	847480	Now, they don't really count as terrorist incidents, in my mind.
847480	849880	If anything, those pins are good.
849880	854280	They show that the German police are good at catching international fugitives.
854280	858080	So, great. The more of those pins, the better, to be honest.
858480	860680	And, of course, we've seen a couple of these already,
860680	865680	but there's a lot of incidents of German nationals being involved in terrorism.
866080	867480	Let's look at the chart.
867880	875280	Now, just over half of the cases on this map do concern refugees or migrants into Germany, believe it or not.
875280	878880	Now, the second largest slice of the pie are German nationals.
878880	885280	And next, there's a certain amount of stories in which the suspect's nationality is not mentioned or is unknown.
885680	889480	And a small percentage concern mixed groups.
889480	893480	That's German nationals and foreign nationals working together.
893480	899280	Now, remember, a significant part of that half of the pie, that are refugees and migrants,
899280	902280	didn't necessarily commit any crimes in Germany.
902280	909080	In fact, there aren't many actual terror attacks in Germany in 2016 on this map.
909480	911680	We can go through them right now, actually.
912480	918280	A teenage girl stabbed a police officer non-fatally, claiming ISIS ordered her to do it.
918480	920280	She is a German national.
920680	924680	A 53-year-old convert to Islam attacked the police.
924680	926680	Now, she is a German national.
927280	931480	A 12-year-old was arrested in connection with a terror plot to bomb a market.
931480	933680	Now, he's a German national, too.
934280	940480	A Syrian who was denied asylum blew himself up, killing himself and injuring others.
941280	943280	And the next is quite a famous one.
943480	949080	An Afghan refugee attacked people on a train with a hatchet, injuring five people.
949480	953480	There is also the awful terror attack on the Berlin market the other day.
953480	958480	Now, the police initially didn't know who committed that attack.
958480	963480	They arrested a Pakistani national and then let him go, saying there was no evidence.
963680	967480	And they then suspected a Tunisian man who was on the run.
967880	973080	He was a failed asylum seeker in Germany who was under police surveillance,
973080	977880	or had been under police surveillance in the past, and was in the process of being deported.
978280	982880	He was just, today, shot dead by police in Milan.
983280	985880	So if it was him, that's good.
986280	990880	Apart from that, though, we have, at most, a couple of refugees,
990880	994680	a rejected asylum seeker, and a bunch of German nationals.
994680	999280	Now, whatever immigration policy you think could have stopped all of these attacks,
999280	1004480	better also come with a free time machine, because a lot of these people were born in Germany
1004680	1008080	as the children, or even grandchildren, of immigrants.
1008280	1011880	They are Germans. They have German passports.
1012080	1015080	They're only on this map because they're not white.
1015280	1022280	Actual refugees and asylum seekers, by and large, don't tend to do much terrorism, it seems.
1022280	1027480	You know, Europe-wide, there's large-scale attacks perpetrated by foreign terror groups,
1027480	1031480	and there's lone wolf, disaffected, second-generation immigrants and the likes,
1031480	1037280	but not many actual attacks carried out by successful asylum seekers.
1037480	1039080	And I'll leave you with a thought.
1039280	1043680	At the time of writing this, there are 12,000 pins in this map.
1043680	1049680	Now, apparently, Germany accepted more than one million migrants in 2015.
1049880	1055880	Now, even if we round down to one million, and we ignore anyone that arrived in 2016,
1055880	1061280	and we assume every pin in this map is a genuine refugee or migrant crime,
1061480	1067480	that is, no duplicates, no false stories, no murders that actually took place in Turkey,
1067480	1074280	no German nationals committing crimes, no unknown suspects, no burnt toast recorded as arson,
1074480	1079880	even if we assume all of those things, and we assume every single individual pin in this map
1079880	1084080	was a crime committed by a different individual migrant,
1084480	1092680	As represented here, only 1.2% of the migrants who came into Germany in 2015 would be criminals.
1093280	1095280	This map is silly.
1095480	1100480	It is not a list of confirmed migrant and refugee crimes.
1100880	1105280	It is ridiculous and unscientific moral panic.
1105880	1112080	It's bigotry, anti-immigrant sentiment, and anti-Islamic racism.
1112480	1118080	If you base any of your beliefs or actions on this map, you have been fooled.
1119880	1123280	I'm sorry, I don't want to be mean about anyone, you know?
1123280	1127680	It's never nice when you get to the point in the video where it sounds like you're saying,
1128080	1130080	if you fell for this, you're a moron.
1130280	1135280	You know, I'm not saying that because, in fairness, it's a pretty slick production at first sight.
1135480	1141080	Not many people are gonna go and actually check hundreds of German sources, you know, understandably,
1141080	1144280	and the group who made the map are relying on that.
1144880	1150080	You're just meant to go, oh wow, look at that scary map, I guess refugees must all be criminals.
1150880	1155080	You know, come on guys, let's try and up our game a bit, eh?
1155880	1157680	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1157880	1163680	I'd just like to say before I go that I am not attempting to downplay or ignore any actual crimes
1163680	1166680	or actual terror attacks that took place.
1167080	1170680	Of course, if a large number of new people move into a country,
1170680	1176680	the absolute number of crimes is going to go up just because there's more potential criminals.
1177280	1179680	And more potential victims, too.
1180080	1184880	I'm not saying none of these crimes happened, or that none of these terror attacks happened,
1184880	1186880	because of course, some of them did.
1187280	1191880	But just because some did, doesn't mean we should start pretending that more did.
1192280	1197080	The purpose of this video was to debunk this map as a legitimate source,
1197080	1200880	not make excuses for actual crimes that happened.
1201280	1206680	Can you tell I'm trying to cut down on the incoming wave of dislikes and people commenting,
1206680	1210280	but you're ignoring all the actual crimes carried out by immigrants?
1211880	1216880	It doesn't matter, really. Those people aren't gonna watch this far into the video, so...
1216880	1219680	Whatever. Bring them on. The more, the merrier.
1220080	1223880	And before I go, I'd just like to thank everyone who helped, or offered to help,
1223880	1227280	with the translations of the news articles used in this video.
1227680	1231280	A lot of very kind people helped me out, or offered to help me out.
1231280	1237680	And I'd like in particular to thank "@roonmian on Twitter", who did the bulk of the translation work.
1237680	1239080	So, thanks a lot.
1239680	1244480	If you'd like more videos like this, consider sending me a dollar on Patreon.
1244480	1248280	This is your last chance to get in on my very first month on Patreon
1248280	1251880	and get your name in the credits of a video next month.
1252280	1255680	And what a great way to start out the new year that would be, hey?
1256080	1258080	You could show all of your friends and say,
1258680	1264280	hey, look, there's my name in the credits of a video with a 1 to 10 like-to-dislike ratio.
1264880	1270080	Anyway, farewell, everyone, happy holidays, and I'll see you all next year.
