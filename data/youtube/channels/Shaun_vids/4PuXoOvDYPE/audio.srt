00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,900
So, today, we're gonna be talking about a map.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,600
A map of Germany, with a bunch of coloured pins all over it.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,600
And this is a map I've seen crop up in a few different places on the internet.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,600
For example, here it is in a Black Pigeon Speaks video.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,300
Here's someone pretending to be a kangaroo while talking about it.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't really know what's happening there.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,100
And it also shows up in the videos of definitely not racist German person, Kraut and T.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,300
And let's give him the honour of explaining what this map is.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,600
Let me show you something.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,200
This here is a Twitter account called X-Ipsilon-Einselfall.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,600
All it does is tweet out confirmed cases of migrant crime,

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
then creates a dot and places that dot on a map of Germany.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
Seven months ago, this is what the map looked like.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Well, this is what it looks like today.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,900
No, you're not looking at a coloured-out picture of Germany.

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,300
This is a representation of migrant crime here over the course of the last year,

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,800
since the migrant and refugee crisis.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,100
So, this map shows confirmed instances of migrant or refugee crime.

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,800
Confirmed. Just remember that word.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,400
Just in case.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,100
So, this map has been put together by Facebook group X-Y-Einselfall.

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,200
And it's not a racial thing, obviously.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,200
They're just concerned with documenting refugee and migrant crime, and nothing else.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,700
Race has nothing to do with it.

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,000
Except, well, I'm what we call a rational skeptic here on YouTube,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,500
and I've come up with an alternative hypothesis.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,000
What if this map isn't really about documenting only confirmed cases of migrant and refugee crime,

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,800
and is instead really about making a scary-looking map to frighten people into being racist?

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,200
Now, that might sound crazy, I know, but it's a possibility, isn't it?

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,200
So, how do we go about proving or disproving this theory?

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:19,900
Well, what we're gonna have to do is have a closer look at this map and the sources contained thereupon.

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:26,500
And there are different sections on this map for theft, arson, terror attacks, sexual assault, and so on,

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,300
and we're gonna be looking at a few of these sections.

35
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,400
We're gonna take a look at the sources and see if these are actually confirmed migrant crimes,

36
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,200
or, instead, a load of old bollocks.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,100
So, firstly, I have to mention duplicates.

38
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,600
Now, some of these pins are for the same incidents, I'm sorry to say.

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,200
For example, these two arson pins in Hanover point to the same news story,

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,200
and these three terror pins in Dusseldorf also point to the same news story.

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,600
And these two other terror pins, also in Dusseldorf, also point to the same news story.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,800
And if you look deeper into that particular news story, actually,

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,400
you'll see the suspects, in that case, are German nationals, not refugees.

44
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Dortfahafften sie den Deutschen convertiten Sebastian B.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,800
Der vorwöf mit glietschaft in der zur Zeitwohl brutalsten terroristischen Varenigung.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,600
And actually, if we look even deeper into this news story,

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:34,800
we'll see that the map links to a page describing Sebastian B's sentencing in April of 2016,

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,600
but he was actually arrested in early 2015.

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,600
So, if we're looking for confirmed cases of migrant crime in 2016,

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,400
well, this wasn't a migrant, it was a German guy, and the crime didn't even take place in 2016.

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,600
And this is on the map multiple times.

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,200
And to be honest, I consider this map busted right here, you know?

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
It's over, this map is bullshit, clearly, but...

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:09,800
You know, since we're here anyway, we may as well put the work in and kick it while it's down for another, say, 15 minutes.

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,200
You see, this map is not based on any police or government statistics.

56
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:21,400
It is a civilian group, I believe comprised of multiple people collecting news stories and police reports,

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,000
none of whom seem too interested in checking for duplicates.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,200
So, keep in mind when you look at this map, a lot of these pins are actually separate instances of the same crime.

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,600
So anyway, first off, let's take a look at arson.

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:44,400
The horrible crime of arson, intentionally setting fire to things with the intent to cause damage.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Now, there are a bit over 100 arson cases on this map, so let's have a look at a few.

62
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,600
Here's one in Duisburg.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,400
In July, in Duisburg, saying that wrong,

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,800
some trash was set on fire in an uninhabited building by an unknown suspect he's described as very thin,

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,600
35 to 45 years old, and as having dark skin.

66
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,200
So that's arson, but is he a migrant?

67
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,000
He wasn't arrested, and the police don't know who he is, so he could be anyone.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,800
There's no mention of him being a refugee or a migrant.

69
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,200
He could have been born in Germany, who knows, but that's just one pin.

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
Another one in Soltau.

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Some teenagers set a fire in the woods.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,800
They're between 13 and 15 years old.

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Southeastern European look, apparently, but again, they weren't caught.

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,800
So there's no way to know if they're migrants or refugees, or neither.

75
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,200
Whoever included this pin on the map is just assuming that they're refugees based upon their described skin color.

76
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:03,400
In this case, in Schneeberg, a refugee home had to be evacuated because of a triggered fire detector.

77
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,000
But there's no indication there was actually a fire.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,200
In this case, in Wendlingen, I am butchering the names of these German towns, I'm sorry,

79
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,600
a refugee burned some toast and set the toaster on fire.

80
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Now, nobody was hurt, but there was a lot of smoke.

81
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Now, is a small accidental cooking fire that injures nobody and causes minimal damage really worthy of being called arson?

82
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,600
I mean, we've all burned toast before, haven't we?

83
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,600
You know, my dad once set the cooker on fire making bacon.

84
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Is he an arsonist?

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,400
You know, I'm having kind of a hard time being afraid of this refugee and his burnt toast.

86
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,200
Now, before I'm accused of cherry-picking a few examples out of the entire map here,

87
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:05,000
I have went through every single one of these so-called arson cases on the map, so cue the music.

88
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,000
A cooking fire, a cooking fire, a cooking fire.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,600
Another cooking fire, another cooking fire.

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,120
Firecrackers set off a fire alarm accidentally.

91
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,000
A cooking fire, another cooking fire.

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,880
Improper disposal of a cigarette, another cooking fire, another cooking fire, another cigarette.

93
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,280
Improper use of candles, no injuries there, amazingly.

94
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Another cooking fire, another cooking fire.

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,480
There was an accident in a kitchen when someone was cooking that caused a small fire.

96
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,280
Another cooking fire, a possible electrical fault.

97
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,080
Imagine that, that's awesome now apparently, electrical fault.

98
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,280
Another cooking fire, another cigarette, improper usage of a candle, again.

99
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:11,680
Another cooking fire, improper disposal of wood embers, and a bunch more cooking fires.

100
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Lastly, I'd like to look at my favorite cooking fire story.

101
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:23,480
A Syrian in Ovenstad left a pot on the stove and it went on fire.

102
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,680
And the reason this is my favorite one of these stories is because there's a picture of the offending pot.

103
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Um, I guess not much happens in Ovenstad generally.

104
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Now actually, almost half the pins in this map are for fires that were either started accidentally or have unknown causes.

105
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:50,880
And remember, some of those intentional fires were started by people who are not known to be immigrants or refugees because they weren't caught.

106
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,480
They were just started by people who witnesses say were not white.

107
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:03,480
And if we look at the arrest statistics here, we see that more than half of the news stories on this map make no mention of an arrest taking place,

108
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,280
either because the fire was accidental or because the suspect is unknown.

109
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:16,080
So how many pins on this map are news stories about a refugee or migrant actually being convicted of arson?

110
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Well, you can count them on one hand.

111
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:27,280
The problem for the XY Einzelfall people, though, is that this doesn't look as scary as this, does it?

112
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,880
Well, maybe if we scroll out far enough...

113
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Oh God, look! Germany's on fire!

114
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,280
So anyway, let's take a look at robberies and thefts.

115
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:46,080
Now, there are 5,500 sources here and my German is absolutely rubbish.

116
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,480
So, if I looked at all of these sources, I would still be making this video next year.

117
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,280
So, I decided to take a look at the first 50 sources as a representative example.

118
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,280
And let's look at a couple.

119
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,080
In Düsseldorf, in February, an 88-year-old's handbag was stolen by a thief.

120
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,280
He was 20 to 30 years old, dressed in dark, and had a dark skin colour.

121
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,480
He was not apprehended, and there's absolutely no way to know his migrant status.

122
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Again, maybe he was born in Germany. Maybe he migrated to Germany 20 years ago. Who knows?

123
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,280
And this is something you see time and time again on the map.

124
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:35,480
Suspects are described as having dark skin, or a southern appearance, or a Mediterranean appearance,

125
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,880
or a Latin appearance, with no other identifying information that could tell us if they're actually refugees.

126
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:50,680
The XY Einzelfall Group is just making the assumption that all non-white criminals are not German.

127
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,480
Even in cases like the following from Hamburg, now the suspect here is described as being a southerner,

128
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,080
but also as speaking German without an accent.

129
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Now, speaking German without an accent would suggest to me that he's not a refugee or a migrant,

130
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,280
or at least not a recent one, but regardless, it's marked down here as a migrant crime.

131
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:21,680
Of the 50 pins I looked at here, only five connected to news stories in which the suspect's status as a migrant or refugee was confirmed.

132
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,880
The other 45 were all speculative, and based only on physical descriptions of the suspect.

133
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,880
So at this point in my source checking, I was starting to get the feeling that the XY Einzelfall people that made the map

134
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,680
weren't really interested in migrant crime or refugee crime.

135
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,880
What this is really about, it seems, is non-white crime.

136
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:51,480
And it's hard to argue with this when we look at stories like the following one from Hanover, and this is one of the murder pins.

137
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:59,280
A suspect named as Ali Kemal S was wanted for the murder of a woman in Istanbul in Turkey.

138
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Now, the suspect in this case is from Hanover in Germany.

139
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,080
He is a German national, and he allegedly killed someone in Turkey, a foreign country.

140
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:20,080
And this is marked down as a migrant murder on the map, and I guess, you know, kinda, but isn't that cheating a little bit, guys?

141
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,080
You know, migrant crime. German migrants going to other countries and murdering people, you know.

142
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Anyway, enough nibbling around the edges here, let's get into the meat of it.

143
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,680
The terror pins for all the terrible terrorism.

144
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,480
All these pins are there for acts of terror, so let's look at a few.

145
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,280
So, in July, in Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe?

146
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,680
A German national was arrested for online support of the Islamic State.

147
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,880
Now, in what sense is this a migrant or refugee crime? That's a German guy supporting the Islamic State.

148
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,880
Why is that being blamed on refugees?

149
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Next up, Eisenhundstadt, Jesus Christ.

150
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,480
A German man was said to have explosives and be planning a terror attack.

151
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,880
Police raided his house and found no evidence of him planning a terror attack, no Islamist material or explosive material.

152
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,280
Although he did have two firecrackers.

153
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Now, that's not a terror attack. It's not even a planned terror attack.

154
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,880
What this news story says, essentially, is a native German man owns two firecrackers.

155
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,680
And that's marked on the map as a refugee terror attack.

156
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,680
And, again, before I'm accused of cherry-picking here, I looked at every terror pin on this map.

157
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:54,280
And first off, a lot of the pins here are for crimes that did not actually take place in 2016.

158
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,080
There's a lot of cases of suspects being arrested in Germany

159
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,480
for crimes that have taken place in other countries, often in previous years.

160
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Now, they don't really count as terrorist incidents, in my mind.

161
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,880
If anything, those pins are good.

162
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,280
They show that the German police are good at catching international fugitives.

163
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,080
So, great. The more of those pins, the better, to be honest.

164
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,680
And, of course, we've seen a couple of these already,

165
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,680
but there's a lot of incidents of German nationals being involved in terrorism.

166
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
Let's look at the chart.

167
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:35,280
Now, just over half of the cases on this map do concern refugees or migrants into Germany, believe it or not.

168
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,880
Now, the second largest slice of the pie are German nationals.

169
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,280
And next, there's a certain amount of stories in which the suspect's nationality is not mentioned or is unknown.

170
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,480
And a small percentage concern mixed groups.

171
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,480
That's German nationals and foreign nationals working together.

172
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,280
Now, remember, a significant part of that half of the pie, that are refugees and migrants,

173
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,280
didn't necessarily commit any crimes in Germany.

174
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:09,080
In fact, there aren't many actual terror attacks in Germany in 2016 on this map.

175
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,680
We can go through them right now, actually.

176
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,280
A teenage girl stabbed a police officer non-fatally, claiming ISIS ordered her to do it.

177
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,280
She is a German national.

178
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,680
A 53-year-old convert to Islam attacked the police.

179
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,680
Now, she is a German national.

180
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,480
A 12-year-old was arrested in connection with a terror plot to bomb a market.

181
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,680
Now, he's a German national, too.

182
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,480
A Syrian who was denied asylum blew himself up, killing himself and injuring others.

183
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
And the next is quite a famous one.

184
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,080
An Afghan refugee attacked people on a train with a hatchet, injuring five people.

185
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,480
There is also the awful terror attack on the Berlin market the other day.

186
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Now, the police initially didn't know who committed that attack.

187
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,480
They arrested a Pakistani national and then let him go, saying there was no evidence.

188
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,480
And they then suspected a Tunisian man who was on the run.

189
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,080
He was a failed asylum seeker in Germany who was under police surveillance,

190
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,880
or had been under police surveillance in the past, and was in the process of being deported.

191
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,880
He was just, today, shot dead by police in Milan.

192
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,880
So if it was him, that's good.

193
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,880
Apart from that, though, we have, at most, a couple of refugees,

194
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,680
a rejected asylum seeker, and a bunch of German nationals.

195
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,280
Now, whatever immigration policy you think could have stopped all of these attacks,

196
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,480
better also come with a free time machine, because a lot of these people were born in Germany

197
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,080
as the children, or even grandchildren, of immigrants.

198
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,880
They are Germans. They have German passports.

199
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,080
They're only on this map because they're not white.

200
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Actual refugees and asylum seekers, by and large, don't tend to do much terrorism, it seems.

201
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,480
You know, Europe-wide, there's large-scale attacks perpetrated by foreign terror groups,

202
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,480
and there's lone wolf, disaffected, second-generation immigrants and the likes,

203
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,280
but not many actual attacks carried out by successful asylum seekers.

204
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,080
And I'll leave you with a thought.

205
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,680
At the time of writing this, there are 12,000 pins in this map.

206
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Now, apparently, Germany accepted more than one million migrants in 2015.

207
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Now, even if we round down to one million, and we ignore anyone that arrived in 2016,

208
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,280
and we assume every pin in this map is a genuine refugee or migrant crime,

209
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,480
that is, no duplicates, no false stories, no murders that actually took place in Turkey,

210
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,280
no German nationals committing crimes, no unknown suspects, no burnt toast recorded as arson,

211
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,880
even if we assume all of those things, and we assume every single individual pin in this map

212
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,080
was a crime committed by a different individual migrant,

213
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:12,680
As represented here, only 1.2% of the migrants who came into Germany in 2015 would be criminals.

214
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
This map is silly.

215
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,480
It is not a list of confirmed migrant and refugee crimes.

216
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,280
It is ridiculous and unscientific moral panic.

217
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:32,080
It's bigotry, anti-immigrant sentiment, and anti-Islamic racism.

218
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,080
If you base any of your beliefs or actions on this map, you have been fooled.

219
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,280
I'm sorry, I don't want to be mean about anyone, you know?

220
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,680
It's never nice when you get to the point in the video where it sounds like you're saying,

221
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
if you fell for this, you're a moron.

222
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,280
You know, I'm not saying that because, in fairness, it's a pretty slick production at first sight.

223
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,080
Not many people are gonna go and actually check hundreds of German sources, you know, understandably,

224
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,280
and the group who made the map are relying on that.

225
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,080
You're just meant to go, oh wow, look at that scary map, I guess refugees must all be criminals.

226
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,080
You know, come on guys, let's try and up our game a bit, eh?

227
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,680
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

228
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,680
I'd just like to say before I go that I am not attempting to downplay or ignore any actual crimes

229
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,680
or actual terror attacks that took place.

230
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,680
Of course, if a large number of new people move into a country,

231
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,680
the absolute number of crimes is going to go up just because there's more potential criminals.

232
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,680
And more potential victims, too.

233
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,880
I'm not saying none of these crimes happened, or that none of these terror attacks happened,

234
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
because of course, some of them did.

235
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,880
But just because some did, doesn't mean we should start pretending that more did.

236
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,080
The purpose of this video was to debunk this map as a legitimate source,

237
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,880
not make excuses for actual crimes that happened.

238
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,680
Can you tell I'm trying to cut down on the incoming wave of dislikes and people commenting,

239
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,280
but you're ignoring all the actual crimes carried out by immigrants?

240
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,880
It doesn't matter, really. Those people aren't gonna watch this far into the video, so...

241
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,680
Whatever. Bring them on. The more, the merrier.

242
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,880
And before I go, I'd just like to thank everyone who helped, or offered to help,

243
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,280
with the translations of the news articles used in this video.

244
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,280
A lot of very kind people helped me out, or offered to help me out.

245
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,680
And I'd like in particular to thank "@roonmian on Twitter", who did the bulk of the translation work.

246
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,080
So, thanks a lot.

247
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,480
If you'd like more videos like this, consider sending me a dollar on Patreon.

248
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,280
This is your last chance to get in on my very first month on Patreon

249
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,880
and get your name in the credits of a video next month.

250
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,680
And what a great way to start out the new year that would be, hey?

251
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
You could show all of your friends and say,

252
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,280
hey, look, there's my name in the credits of a video with a 1 to 10 like-to-dislike ratio.

253
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,080
Anyway, farewell, everyone, happy holidays, and I'll see you all next year.
