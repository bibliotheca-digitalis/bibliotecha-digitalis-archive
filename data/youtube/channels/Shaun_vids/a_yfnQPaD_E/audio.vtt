00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
Hello, everyone. So, today, I want to talk about white identity.

00:04.840 --> 00:08.120
Now, one question I get a lot on my Curious Cat page is,

00:08.120 --> 00:14.520
are you worried about the prevalence of white nationalist rhetoric among younger white men online?

00:14.520 --> 00:17.240
And my answer is always, yes, I am.

00:17.240 --> 00:22.080
But today, I thought I'd flesh that answer out a bit and discuss these young white guys

00:22.080 --> 00:26.080
and their increasing familiarity with open white nationalism.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.080
And we're gonna tell a bit of a story.

00:28.080 --> 00:33.520
We're gonna talk about how this identity coalesced and gained steam during Gamergate,

00:33.520 --> 00:40.000
and how it transformed into the Pepe avatar alt-right Trump-supporting mess it is today.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.760
And the reason I really want to talk about this now is that I've been noticing a certain dissatisfaction with Trump

00:45.760 --> 00:50.080
among a lot of the frogs, and many of them, understandably, don't seem too happy

00:50.080 --> 00:54.160
with the general level of ineptitude he's displayed since coming to office.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.880
And many others are even openly expressing regret for even having voted for him.

00:58.880 --> 01:05.600
You know, you've got the usual Pepe avatar people, the folks using the frog emoji in their Twitter names,

01:05.600 --> 01:13.520
and Trump's also apparently lost the support of Darth Vader, Frankenstein's monster, and Skeletor.

01:13.520 --> 01:19.040
So I also want to ask, how did all of these chumps get hoodwinked so easily?

01:19.040 --> 01:23.600
And once they all wake up to the fact that Trump was just using them all along,

01:23.840 --> 01:25.840
where are they gonna go next?

01:25.840 --> 01:28.720
Now, a few disclaimers before we start.

01:28.720 --> 01:34.720
Unlike some people, I don't think Gamergate caused Trump to become president or anything, you know?

01:34.720 --> 01:38.480
While there was a small swing away from the Democrats among younger people,

01:39.120 --> 01:41.680
and of course Trump was definitely favored by white men,

01:42.240 --> 01:48.560
I don't really think any of these Pepe memes or the likes really affected the outcome of the election that much.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.480
We're giving them too much credit, I think, when we suggest that.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.760
Another disclaimer.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.240
This video is not a defense of these guys.

01:56.240 --> 02:01.600
When I ran this idea past Jen, she thought it sounded like I was making excuses for them.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.600
And I don't want to do that.

02:03.600 --> 02:09.120
I'd like to try and explain their behavior and motivations, but not excuse their actions.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.200
So I thought I'd just make that clear here.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.120
I apologize if it seems like I'm giving them an easy ride.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.360
And a final thing before we start.

02:17.360 --> 02:21.120
I'd like to say hello to any of these people who are watching.

02:21.840 --> 02:22.560
Hello there.

02:23.440 --> 02:28.000
Thanks for stopping by to hit dislike and call me a cuck, and so on.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.160
But once you're done with that though,

02:30.160 --> 02:35.600
I would encourage you to stick around and watch the rest of the video just for a change of pace, if nothing else.

02:36.640 --> 02:40.960
Right now, you won't agree with anything I say, and you'll think I'm an idiot.

02:40.960 --> 02:45.360
But it'll plant a few seeds in your head that will slowly come to fruition.

02:45.360 --> 02:50.480
And eventually, in about two or three years, you'll realize that I was right about everything.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.640
That's the hope, anyway.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.480
Anyway, let's get to it.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.840
So let's set the stage.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.120
Who are these people who we're talking about?

02:59.120 --> 03:06.800
Well, they're nerds on the internet who are typically straight, white, cis, young, and male.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.880
Not exclusively, granted, you know.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.480
For every one of those identifiers, you can find a few outliers,

03:14.480 --> 03:17.200
but broadly, that's who we're dealing with.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.800
And to start off, let's try and get inside their mindset.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.640
Now, this is something easy for me,

03:22.640 --> 03:26.720
because I used to be one of these people until I grew out of it, you know?

03:26.720 --> 03:29.600
If my parents had met five to ten years later,

03:29.600 --> 03:36.240
I'd probably be watching alt-right YouTube videos and tweeting about Kekistan, whatever that's supposed to be.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.400
And that's a scary thought, you know?

03:38.400 --> 03:41.200
There but for the grace of God, go I.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.360
And here's the world according to the frog people.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.360
First off, institutionalized prejudice is a thing of the past.

03:49.440 --> 03:54.480
And indeed, if prejudice against minorities even exists at all anymore,

03:54.480 --> 03:56.800
it's purely on an individual level.

03:56.800 --> 04:01.520
It's a personal choice informed in no way by wider society.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.560
And legality trumps all arguments here, you know?

04:04.560 --> 04:08.720
Minorities have the vote now, and business discrimination is technically illegal.

04:09.280 --> 04:13.680
Therefore, it doesn't happen outside of a few bad eggs.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.960
Secondly, we live in a meritocracy.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.920
If women get paid less than men, that's because they can't compete.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.520
If black people get arrested and incarcerated disproportionately,

04:25.520 --> 04:28.400
that's because they're more likely to be criminals.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.080
Everyone is on equal footing now, you see.

04:32.080 --> 04:37.600
And if anyone can't keep up with straight white men, well, that's just because they're not as good.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.360
Now, most of them know not to say it this directly in the open, of course,

04:41.360 --> 04:44.000
but basically this is what they believe.

04:44.080 --> 04:48.720
And it stems, in part, I think, from a misunderstanding of history.

04:48.720 --> 04:53.280
If you don't know too much about history, it's hard to contextualize a lot of this stuff,

04:53.280 --> 04:55.440
especially if you're a younger person.

04:55.440 --> 05:01.680
Everything that happened before they were born took place sort of nebulously a long time ago,

05:01.680 --> 05:04.160
and now it's all the same as ancient history.

05:04.160 --> 05:08.800
It has no bearing at all on the modern day, or so it seems to them.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.080
For example, it was not that long ago in my own life that I realized

05:12.080 --> 05:15.680
how relatively recent legal slavery was in the West,

05:15.680 --> 05:19.920
and the effects of that system are not something that disappear overnight, obviously.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.280
Similarly with women's suffrage and so on.

05:23.280 --> 05:28.320
Speaking in terms of the span of human history, this all happened yesterday.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.280
And another factor here is just the natural tendency

05:31.280 --> 05:34.160
to want to see arguments break in your favor.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.880
You know, it's much easier to believe in a meritocracy

05:36.880 --> 05:39.600
if you're someone who is already doing okay.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.240
Or rather, and it gets a little complicated here,

05:44.240 --> 05:48.720
someone who is not doing okay, but feels like they should be,

05:48.720 --> 05:54.480
and blames the fact that they're not on the enemies of the imaginary meritocracy.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.840
You know, if the playing field is naturally already level,

05:57.840 --> 06:01.440
then any attempt to advocate for any type of social minority

06:01.440 --> 06:06.080
is coming directly and unfairly at the expense of straight white men.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.520
You know, when is White History Month?

06:09.520 --> 06:12.080
Why can't we have a straight Pride parade?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.800
When is International Men's Day?

06:14.800 --> 06:19.040
You see, to these young white guys, it seems like everyone else but them

06:19.040 --> 06:22.640
has an identity that they're allowed to be openly proud of.

06:23.280 --> 06:26.720
And that doesn't make sense if we're supposed to be on a level playing field.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.760
You know, why is it that a black person or a gay person

06:29.760 --> 06:31.760
can take pride in those identities,

06:31.760 --> 06:36.800
but I'm not allowed to openly take pride in my race or my sexuality?

06:36.800 --> 06:37.840
That's not fair.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.880
Now, as a straight white man myself, I understand the answers to those questions,

06:42.880 --> 06:49.200
but that understanding came at the tail end of a lot of learning and reading and contextualizing.

06:49.200 --> 06:54.960
Perhaps more learning and contextualizing than it's reasonable to expect a teenager to have done,

06:54.960 --> 06:59.680
especially considering the state of the education system in a lot of these places in the States,

06:59.680 --> 07:03.440
but, you know, that's just the younger ones, I want to make clear.

07:03.440 --> 07:08.160
Some of these guys are in their 30s and older, so I've got no sympathy at all for them.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.960
Anyway, with these minority identities come narratives.

07:13.680 --> 07:18.880
Narratives that include being oppressed and working to overcome that oppression.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.240
And now, if we don't consider all the negatives of oppression,

07:22.880 --> 07:26.000
you know, if we take the actual oppression out of oppression,

07:26.880 --> 07:28.960
it can seem quite romantic.

07:28.960 --> 07:34.880
You know, succeeding despite being the underdog is a lot more exciting and heroic,

07:34.880 --> 07:40.720
narratively speaking, than succeeding when society expects you to succeed.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.640
And among these young white men, there's definitely an unvoiced

07:44.640 --> 07:50.080
and perhaps even subconscious jealousy of being left out of that narrative.

07:50.080 --> 07:54.560
In fact, they share their identity with the oppressors in all of these narratives,

07:54.560 --> 08:00.720
you know, white over black, straight over gay, cis over trans, men over women, and so on.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.880
So it seems to them that they've been unfairly cast as the bad guy

08:04.880 --> 08:08.800
without actually having done anything wrong as an individual.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.880
So society, rather than being biased against people who aren't them,

08:13.440 --> 08:17.040
is actually therefore biased against straight white men

08:17.040 --> 08:20.480
who are not allowed to have an identity or a narrative.

08:20.480 --> 08:24.640
And I'd just like to reiterate at this point that I don't agree with any of this,

08:24.640 --> 08:28.480
and this is happening primarily in their own heads.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.440
That's just to clarify for Jen if she's listening.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.480
Now, let's first position ourselves in time a couple of years ago,

08:36.480 --> 08:39.760
and we've got a bunch of angry young white dudes on the internet

08:39.760 --> 08:44.640
without much historical, economic, or political context with which to understand the world,

08:45.360 --> 08:47.600
and they're feeling increasingly left out.

08:47.600 --> 08:52.800
If something unfair or embarrassing or upsetting or disappointing happens to them,

08:52.800 --> 08:58.000
they can't say, well, it's probably because I'm white or straight or a man.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
You know, there's no socially acceptable explanatory narrative at hand

09:02.000 --> 09:05.760
for them to rationalize the negative aspects of their lives.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.680
In fact, society is constantly signaling to them the opposite,

09:09.680 --> 09:13.920
that they should be doing great, you know, you're the best, you should be on top,

09:13.920 --> 09:16.640
but that's not how it feels to them.

09:16.640 --> 09:22.160
And they can't openly bemoan the fate of straight white guys without being called idiot racists,

09:22.160 --> 09:23.600
so what do they do?

09:24.240 --> 09:29.600
Well, they displace their anger and frustration onto the one other identity

09:29.600 --> 09:32.560
that pretty much all young white men on the internet share.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.640
They're all gamers.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.880
They all play video games.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.760
So, gamergate, where the gamers finally said,

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
We're not gonna take this anymore.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.240
And everyone else said,

09:48.240 --> 09:50.080
Take what anymore?

09:50.800 --> 09:52.160
And the gamers replied,

09:53.120 --> 09:56.800
We're not gonna take this anymore, but louder.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.880
So I'm gonna say some things about gamers here, so full disclaimer,

10:00.880 --> 10:02.320
I play video games.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.640
I play video games.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.600
I play too many video games.

10:07.600 --> 10:12.080
But I've never really cared when someone insults capital-G gamers,

10:12.080 --> 10:15.600
because video games are just a hobby for me, you know?

10:15.600 --> 10:18.720
They're something I do for fun in my spare time.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.120
Being a gamer is not my identity,

10:21.120 --> 10:24.720
I don't define myself by the fact I play video games,

10:24.720 --> 10:27.680
and nor should anyone else, but that's just me.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.480
Anyway, gamergate.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.640
Now, my own experience of gamergate was to sit on the sidelines heckling

10:34.640 --> 10:37.520
and metaphorically throwing rotten fruit at people.

10:37.520 --> 10:43.200
Now, my guilty pleasure was going on Reddit or 4chan or something awful and asking,

10:43.200 --> 10:47.200
Hey, so what's this gamergate thing everyone's talking about?

10:47.200 --> 10:51.680
You know, just to make everyone type huge text walls about what they thought gamergate was.

10:52.480 --> 10:58.160
So for the blessedly uninitiated, what is gamergate?

10:58.160 --> 10:59.920
Well, briefly, hopefully,

11:00.720 --> 11:06.640
In mid-2014, independent game developer Zoe Quinn was the subject of a blog post

11:06.640 --> 11:11.040
published by a former boyfriend that accused her of cheating on him with various men,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.520
including a games journalist who had previously written about her and a video game she made.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.920
So what does this incident have to do with anything?

11:21.920 --> 11:26.480
Who does it affect outside of the people directly personally involved?

11:27.280 --> 11:30.160
The answers are nothing and nobody.

11:30.160 --> 11:33.360
Of course, a couple had a messy breakup, basically,

11:33.360 --> 11:36.560
but hey, something had to light this trash fire

11:36.560 --> 11:39.040
and it wasn't going to be something legitimate, was it?

11:39.040 --> 11:41.280
So we're stuck with this nonsense.

11:41.280 --> 11:47.040
And if you think about it, the Zoe Quinn incident is sort of the perfect storm in a teacup,

11:47.040 --> 11:48.560
to mix my idioms there.

11:49.120 --> 11:54.400
It's a minor incident, but it's got a lot of contextual multipliers acting on it.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.520
It's about a woman, which is a good start.

11:57.520 --> 12:02.640
A woman game developer, so a woman trespassing in the No Women Treehouse.

12:03.360 --> 12:10.000
She had sex, which is usually a frightening concept in and of itself for self-described gamers.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.920
She allegedly cuckolded a man,

12:12.480 --> 12:18.000
and of course, the most frightening type of sex a woman can have is sex that is not with me.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.360
And there's implicit fraud and deception proving true

12:21.360 --> 12:26.640
all my suspicions about women being duplicitous harlots who'll deceive me at every turn.

12:26.640 --> 12:31.280
And all of these multipliers act to make this remarkably trivial and stupid incident

12:31.280 --> 12:34.320
actually significant in the minds of certain people.

12:34.320 --> 12:41.040
And so they proceeded to organize on sites like Reddit, 4chan, 8chan and so on,

12:41.040 --> 12:46.560
and built a movement primarily concerned with endless complaining about Zoe Quinn

12:46.560 --> 12:50.800
and various other game developers and journalists who were apparently conspiring

12:50.800 --> 12:56.080
to maliciously ruin video games for everyone using feminism.

12:56.080 --> 13:01.040
Really though, Gamergate wasn't about Zoe Quinn or Anita Sarkeesian

13:01.040 --> 13:03.840
or ethics in video game journalism,

13:03.840 --> 13:09.520
which I think became a joke roughly five seconds after the first person even dared to suggest it.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.000
It wasn't even really about video games.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.800
It was about young, straight white men and their lack of an identity.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.320
In my opinion, anyway.

13:18.880 --> 13:24.240
Gaming was the one area of entertainment that they felt was still created for them.

13:24.240 --> 13:28.320
Of course, that's not true, but they felt it was true, which is the important thing.

13:28.320 --> 13:33.920
You know, gaming, being the relative newcomer among television, films, books and the likes,

13:33.920 --> 13:38.240
has been lagging behind somewhat in its representation of minorities.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.160
And it's only fairly recently that people have been talking and writing about games

13:42.160 --> 13:47.200
as if they're a real art form subject to real, thoughtful criticism.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.600
Once almost exclusively the domain of young, white male nerds,

13:51.600 --> 13:56.960
gaming's in the process of opening up to all sorts of players and all sorts of game developers

13:56.960 --> 14:03.120
and all sorts of people writing about games and what they're like and what they could and should be.

14:03.120 --> 14:07.360
And game developers are listening to all these people and games are changing.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.520
Slowly, obviously, but they are.

14:10.240 --> 14:16.160
Which poses a problem for the folks who had taken on Gamer as a surrogate identity.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.360
You know, for young white guys, video games were a safe space

14:19.360 --> 14:24.320
where you didn't have to deal with all these other people and all their different opinions and narratives

14:24.320 --> 14:31.520
and now here they come, insisting that the thing you've adopted as the central pillar of your identity,

14:31.520 --> 14:39.360
the only aspect of your identity that you feel comfortable actually openly enjoying, needs to change.

14:39.360 --> 14:44.160
And they respond to this with a hysterical ferocity that can seem inexplicable

14:44.160 --> 14:49.600
if you don't realize that in their heads they are a genuinely maligned minority.

14:49.600 --> 14:54.960
It's every bit as serious to them as they imagine the civil rights marches were for black people

14:54.960 --> 14:57.120
or the suffragette movement was for women.

14:57.840 --> 15:02.880
It's ridiculous, obviously, but lacking an easily identifiable oppressor,

15:02.880 --> 15:06.480
these young white men have simply fabricated one.

15:06.480 --> 15:10.480
They've constructed a movement and us versus them.

15:10.560 --> 15:16.400
Their narrative has become us versus the people who won't let us have a narrative.

15:16.400 --> 15:20.720
Social justice warriors, feminists, whatever you want to call them.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.840
They won't even let us play video games in peace anymore.

15:24.480 --> 15:30.720
They hate us and want to change us just for being who we are, which means we're oppressed.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.080
Finally.

15:33.040 --> 15:38.880
So these communities exist now and they're backed into a corner in their own heads, you know.

15:39.520 --> 15:43.840
Their gamer identities eroding under the horrific onslaught of

15:43.840 --> 15:49.600
walking simulators about lesbians and relatively unobjectionable women saying they think

15:49.600 --> 15:53.520
female soldiers should wear more than a bikini in a battle.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.840
And it raises an interesting point.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.720
It's always the minorities that get accused of being obsessed with feminism

16:00.720 --> 16:07.920
and identity politics and so on, but in reality those things ultimately exist to level the playing field.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.200
They're a means to an end, that end being equality.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.560
Now, ostensibly, you'd think these straight white men

16:14.560 --> 16:18.320
don't have to be concerned with all this stuff if they don't want to be, you know.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.800
They don't have to go on about feminists online.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.520
There's nothing keeping them here, really.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.440
They can go and be free.

16:25.440 --> 16:30.480
Become Randian supermen, you know, genius alpha male CEOs

16:30.480 --> 16:34.400
or whatever it is they imagine they'd be in an ideal world.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.160
But that's not happening, is it?

16:36.160 --> 16:37.840
Because of course it's not.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.160
We don't live in this ideal world.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.960
We live in an often rubbish world.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.960
So let's talk politics.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.560
If you're age 18 to 26 in the United States,

16:48.560 --> 16:55.360
then the only president you've known during your adult life has been until very recently Barack Obama.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.640
The Bush administration is a distant memory by now.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.840
If you voted for the first time you're able to in 2016,

17:01.840 --> 17:04.560
then you were five when the Iraq war broke out.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.280
That's scary, isn't it?

17:07.280 --> 17:10.400
So a Democrat's been at the helm for eight years,

17:10.400 --> 17:14.080
and yet there are all these problems still in society.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.520
And of course there are excuses for the existence of all of these problems.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.200
Perfectly legitimate excuses, even.

17:21.200 --> 17:25.840
Obama came to power shortly after one of the worst economic downturns in a century.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.720
You can blame Republican obstructionism, corporate lobbying,

17:30.720 --> 17:33.520
the news media, capitalism in general.

17:34.240 --> 17:39.200
And there's at least some merit in all of these factors, especially the economic ones.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.480
There's something about huge layoffs and wage freezes

17:42.480 --> 17:47.040
and bailouts that gets everybody down, societally speaking.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.960
So what does this mean for our fresh-faced young white men?

17:50.960 --> 17:55.520
Well, they don't want to be told that this is as good as it gets.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.080
You know, tons of things suck under Obama,

17:58.080 --> 18:01.200
but at least he's not doing as bad as a Republican.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.840
You know, it's not much of a carrot, really, is it?

18:03.840 --> 18:08.720
It's true, in a sense, but nobody's getting all that excited about it.

18:08.720 --> 18:13.920
It's certainly not motivating a bunch of young white gamer dudes to go and vote for a woman,

18:13.920 --> 18:14.720
that's for sure.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.840
I mean, they haven't seen enough political cycles yet

18:17.840 --> 18:20.720
to understand the only choice they have.

18:20.720 --> 18:26.320
They've got the Republicans who have the image of being old, religious, stuffy, and uncool,

18:26.320 --> 18:30.480
and the only other option seems to them to just be more of the same.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.760
And in the boom years, the system can get away with this.

18:33.760 --> 18:37.600
You know, people have jobs, they're earning money, things are ticking over.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.600
But then inevitably, you get the bust years,

18:41.600 --> 18:46.880
where suddenly young people's expectations and possibilities start diminishing.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.720
You know, compared to their parents,

18:48.720 --> 18:53.360
which is one of the main parameters by which their success in life is going to be judged,

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
it's more expensive to go to school, it's harder to get a job,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.320
that job won't pay as much money, it's harder to afford a house.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.920
And then when it comes voting time,

19:03.920 --> 19:08.000
you have to choose between the people who are actively encouraging all of this

19:08.000 --> 19:10.880
and the people who keep promising to fix it all,

19:10.880 --> 19:13.680
but never actually seem to get around to doing it.

19:13.680 --> 19:18.480
And both parties are staffed largely by people funded by the corporations

19:18.480 --> 19:21.200
who have a stake in nothing being done.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.880
This is not much of a choice.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.440
Now, a little disclaimer here,

19:25.440 --> 19:28.240
I'm not saying both parties are the same.

19:28.240 --> 19:28.960
They're not.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.760
Particularly if you're anything but a straight white man,

19:31.760 --> 19:36.080
it is massively in your interest to vote against the Republicans.

19:36.080 --> 19:41.360
The Democrats' action on minority rights is rather lackluster, actually, in my opinion,

19:41.360 --> 19:44.560
but it's better than the open hostility of the Republicans.

19:45.200 --> 19:50.880
For straight white men, however, it is easy to see why so many were suckered in by Trump.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.560
You know, there's the obvious.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.920
He positioned himself as an anti-establishment candidate

19:55.920 --> 20:00.960
in a year where establishment candidates were incredibly unpopular.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.240
He attacked the usual stable of Republicans running,

20:04.240 --> 20:07.120
said he was gonna drain the swamp, and so on.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.800
Rarely, though, for our young white guys we're talking about,

20:10.800 --> 20:14.240
I don't think that Trump's political positions were all that important

20:14.240 --> 20:16.800
compared to what Trump represented.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.720
He was a fantasy, in a sense,

20:18.720 --> 20:22.960
because he was a white man who said whatever he wanted to,

20:22.960 --> 20:24.160
and he got away with it.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.760
He would openly pander to bigoted white people,

20:27.760 --> 20:30.960
and there's a big market for that lately, as it turns out.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.800
His ideas are all laughable, practically speaking, anyway.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.160
A Muslim ban, a big wall to keep foreigners out.

20:38.160 --> 20:43.440
It's cartoonish and ridiculous, clearly, but none of that matters.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.280
Trump was a white man sticking up for white men

20:47.280 --> 20:49.600
when it seemed like no one else would.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.280
Make America Great Again.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.160
You know, when? When was it great?

20:54.160 --> 20:58.000
If you're not a straight white guy, then the further you go into America's past,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.520
the worse it gets.

20:59.520 --> 21:03.360
Make America Great Again is a threat to most people.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.760
Now, I spend a fair bit of time listening in on the Discord server

21:07.760 --> 21:10.960
for the Reddit page for Donald Trump supporters.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.520
That's r slash The Donald.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.880
And I won't go into it too much right now, but, you know,

21:16.880 --> 21:21.040
as you can see here, well, you get the picture.

21:21.040 --> 21:26.640
The talk is openly racist, worrying about the future of the white race,

21:27.440 --> 21:30.160
using all the racial slurs under the sun.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.680
And I've had a few people tell me,

21:31.680 --> 21:34.080
oh, well, this isn't serious, you know.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.840
They just like his policies and all this race talk is just a joke.

21:37.840 --> 21:41.200
But, honestly, get a grip.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.640
If you think this is just a joke, then you've been tricked.

21:44.640 --> 21:48.560
It's amazing, I know, but racism actually still exists,

21:49.120 --> 21:51.440
and it's coming back in fashion.

21:51.440 --> 21:55.840
Now, over the course of Trump's term, or terms, in office,

21:56.720 --> 21:59.520
a lot of these kids are gonna drift away from supporting him

21:59.520 --> 22:02.560
as they realize he actually is just a politician

22:02.560 --> 22:05.440
who spun them a bunch of crap in order to get elected.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.840
And this brings us back around to where we started

22:07.840 --> 22:09.920
with the first bunch of suckers

22:09.920 --> 22:12.480
slowly coming around to the fact that they've been conned.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.480
So, what's next?

22:15.120 --> 22:17.360
What's gonna happen from here on out?

22:17.360 --> 22:23.840
Well, it's not enough for these people to just stop supporting Trump anymore.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.440
You know, the legitimization of Trump's rhetoric has already happened.

22:27.440 --> 22:31.760
Trump won't be the last, regardless of how he performs in office.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.840
A lot of potential future candidates will have been watching his rise to power

22:35.840 --> 22:37.440
and taking notes.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.560
And if I were doing that,

22:38.560 --> 22:43.200
then point 1A on my list of tips to get elected would say,

22:43.200 --> 22:45.520
you do not have to hide it anymore.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.240
You know, the fascists have come out of the woodwork now.

22:48.240 --> 22:52.720
The white nationalist narrative is running at full steam online,

22:52.720 --> 22:55.760
and many young white guys are flocking to it.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.920
You know, we are past that point by now.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.360
I hope we can all agree.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.280
A cleverer person than me could write an interesting paper

23:03.280 --> 23:06.720
about how memes and icons and emojis

23:06.720 --> 23:11.280
have taken the place of the uniform, the pin and the armband and so on

23:11.280 --> 23:14.560
as the signifiers of a political movement.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.640
Now, these people will mostly all abandon Trump eventually,

23:18.640 --> 23:21.280
not because they've had a change of heart necessarily,

23:21.280 --> 23:24.160
but because they'll find him a disappointment.

23:24.160 --> 23:28.080
He won't drain the swamp or make America great again,

23:28.080 --> 23:30.320
and they'll all move on to someone else,

23:30.320 --> 23:33.280
promising the same things, but even bigger.

23:33.280 --> 23:37.840
So my question going forward is, what can we do about these people, you know?

23:37.840 --> 23:42.160
How can we break them out of the spell of this resurgent white nationalism

23:42.160 --> 23:46.640
with its easy, racialized answers for all the world's problems?

23:46.640 --> 23:48.160
Because that's the thing.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.120
It is easy.

23:49.120 --> 23:53.280
It's comparatively difficult to learn about the economy, for instance,

23:53.280 --> 23:54.560
and how that operates,

23:54.560 --> 23:59.520
but white nationalists look at complicated systemic problems like that

23:59.520 --> 24:02.320
and make them simple racial problems.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.960
You know, it's not our banking system that's broken.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.120
It's the Jews, for example.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.720
It's not the justice system.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.800
It's a problem with black people.

24:10.800 --> 24:14.320
It's not immigration law or foreign policy.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.840
It's the Muslims.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.720
You know, if we just get rid of X type of person,

24:18.720 --> 24:20.960
then the relevant problem will go away.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.000
And combating this is difficult.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.840
It requires more effort to properly understand these issues

24:27.840 --> 24:30.320
than it does to believe the easy lie.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.200
So we're starting out on the back foot here,

24:33.200 --> 24:36.000
and you'd have to have some inhuman amount of belief

24:36.000 --> 24:38.080
in the fundamental goodness of humanity

24:38.080 --> 24:42.000
to think that all of these guys could simply be talked down

24:42.000 --> 24:44.080
from the white nationalist ledge.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.960
Though on the other hand, I'm sure a lot can,

24:46.960 --> 24:49.200
and I'm sure many will grow out of it,

24:49.200 --> 24:52.880
and I'd argue that as they become increasingly disillusioned with Trump

24:52.880 --> 24:54.160
over the next four years,

24:54.160 --> 24:58.960
it's a prime opportunity to try and change their minds.

24:58.960 --> 25:02.160
Though honestly, I don't blame anyone who doesn't have the patience

25:02.160 --> 25:05.200
to argue endlessly with the little pricks.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.520
It's like running on a treadmill, you know?

25:07.520 --> 25:09.280
It feels like you get nowhere.

25:09.280 --> 25:12.720
Now I don't know how to ultimately solve this problem,

25:12.720 --> 25:15.600
but I do have one suggestion I think could help.

25:16.400 --> 25:21.120
They could really use another political narrative to get behind.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.640
You know, the popularity of Bernie Sanders, say,

25:25.440 --> 25:31.120
definitely proved at least the desire for a more left-leaning platform from the Democrats,

25:31.120 --> 25:34.720
which the Democrats themselves are now ignoring as much as possible

25:34.720 --> 25:36.720
instead of capitalizing on.

25:36.720 --> 25:40.320
There are even some people who swapped from supporting Sanders

25:40.320 --> 25:42.960
to supporting Trump when Sanders dropped out,

25:42.960 --> 25:47.360
which seems like an inexplicable position if you're focused on policy.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.440
It's ridiculous, but it actually kind of makes sense

25:51.440 --> 25:55.680
if you think in terms of the narrative of the political outsider.

25:55.680 --> 25:59.120
There's a hunger for politics that differ from the mainstream,

25:59.120 --> 26:02.560
and the actual specifics of how they differ from the mainstream

26:02.560 --> 26:05.040
seems not to matter to some people.

26:05.040 --> 26:10.400
And there's a way, I feel, to appeal directly to the part of these young white guys

26:10.400 --> 26:14.560
that subconsciously maybe wants to be part of an oppressed movement.

26:14.560 --> 26:19.440
And it's ironic because, economically, the answer's right there in front of them.

26:19.440 --> 26:23.760
They have no choice but to take part in an impressive economic system

26:23.760 --> 26:26.880
that's heavily biased in favor of the rich.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.560
The lack of a political identity that some young white men feel

26:30.560 --> 26:33.760
could ideally be filled with a class identity.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.160
You know, still talking about real problems,

26:36.160 --> 26:39.200
but through an actually helpful economic lens

26:39.200 --> 26:42.480
instead of a misleading and bigoted racial one.

26:42.480 --> 26:47.840
Criticizing capitalism is kind of a hard sell in the States, though, I understand.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.680
And I'll throw it open to the comments.

26:49.680 --> 26:55.920
You know, what else can we do to re-educate these people out of their white nationalism?

26:55.920 --> 27:00.080
And yes, I said re-educate. I want to re-educate you.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.360
You gave it a go by yourself, but you fucked up,

27:03.360 --> 27:07.200
and now your brain is wrong and needs to be reprogrammed.

27:07.200 --> 27:11.920
Because ultimately, if this doesn't stop, it's gonna come to blows.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.280
And I don't mean a street scuffle between a group of anti-fascists

27:15.280 --> 27:17.040
and a group of white nationalists,

27:17.040 --> 27:22.800
but potentially, you know, well, if this movement doesn't fizzle out by itself,

27:22.800 --> 27:25.600
it'll eventually end up being stamped out.

27:25.600 --> 27:29.840
And it'd be better to solve all this with words before it comes to that.

27:29.840 --> 27:34.240
Because the white nationalists will definitely lose that fight if it happens,

27:34.240 --> 27:35.760
just like they did last time.

27:35.760 --> 27:38.880
It's an ideology that is destined to lose.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.680
So I'll leave you today with a warning

27:41.680 --> 27:44.960
for any of my fellow straight white gamer dudes who are listening.

27:44.960 --> 27:53.200
It honestly really is in your best interests to stay away from the old fascism there.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.240
It never turns out like they say it will, I promise.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.440
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.520
Let me know what you think in the comments, please.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.600
I'd like to hear your feedback on this one.

28:03.600 --> 28:08.080
And you can get in touch with me on Twitter or Curious Cat if you want to ask a question.

28:08.080 --> 28:12.320
If you liked this video and would like to help me make more videos,

28:12.320 --> 28:14.880
consider pledging me a dollar on Patreon.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.840
I don't run advertisements on my videos at all,

28:17.840 --> 28:20.240
and ideally, I'd like to keep it that way.

28:20.240 --> 28:24.240
However, sadly, I do still need to eat.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.440
And it turns out they don't let you opt out of paying for food

28:27.440 --> 28:29.760
just because you don't like capitalism.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.560
If you're broke right now and you can't afford to pledge anything,

28:33.280 --> 28:37.760
I also accept payment in the form of photographs of genitals.

28:37.760 --> 28:45.040
I'm really kidding.

28:45.040 --> 28:48.560
Please do not send me photographs of your genitals.
