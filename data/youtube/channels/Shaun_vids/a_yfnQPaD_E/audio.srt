00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Hello, everyone. So, today, I want to talk about white identity.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,120
Now, one question I get a lot on my Curious Cat page is,

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,520
are you worried about the prevalence of white nationalist rhetoric among younger white men online?

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,240
And my answer is always, yes, I am.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,080
But today, I thought I'd flesh that answer out a bit and discuss these young white guys

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,080
and their increasing familiarity with open white nationalism.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
And we're gonna tell a bit of a story.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,520
We're gonna talk about how this identity coalesced and gained steam during Gamergate,

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,000
and how it transformed into the Pepe avatar alt-right Trump-supporting mess it is today.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,760
And the reason I really want to talk about this now is that I've been noticing a certain dissatisfaction with Trump

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,080
among a lot of the frogs, and many of them, understandably, don't seem too happy

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,160
with the general level of ineptitude he's displayed since coming to office.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,880
And many others are even openly expressing regret for even having voted for him.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,600
You know, you've got the usual Pepe avatar people, the folks using the frog emoji in their Twitter names,

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,520
and Trump's also apparently lost the support of Darth Vader, Frankenstein's monster, and Skeletor.

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,040
So I also want to ask, how did all of these chumps get hoodwinked so easily?

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
And once they all wake up to the fact that Trump was just using them all along,

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
where are they gonna go next?

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,720
Now, a few disclaimers before we start.

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Unlike some people, I don't think Gamergate caused Trump to become president or anything, you know?

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,480
While there was a small swing away from the Democrats among younger people,

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,680
and of course Trump was definitely favored by white men,

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't really think any of these Pepe memes or the likes really affected the outcome of the election that much.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,480
We're giving them too much credit, I think, when we suggest that.

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,760
Another disclaimer.

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,240
This video is not a defense of these guys.

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,600
When I ran this idea past Jen, she thought it sounded like I was making excuses for them.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,600
And I don't want to do that.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,120
I'd like to try and explain their behavior and motivations, but not excuse their actions.

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,200
So I thought I'd just make that clear here.

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,120
I apologize if it seems like I'm giving them an easy ride.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
And a final thing before we start.

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,120
I'd like to say hello to any of these people who are watching.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,560
Hello there.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,000
Thanks for stopping by to hit dislike and call me a cuck, and so on.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
But once you're done with that though,

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,600
I would encourage you to stick around and watch the rest of the video just for a change of pace, if nothing else.

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,960
Right now, you won't agree with anything I say, and you'll think I'm an idiot.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,360
But it'll plant a few seeds in your head that will slowly come to fruition.

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,480
And eventually, in about two or three years, you'll realize that I was right about everything.

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
That's the hope, anyway.

42
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
Anyway, let's get to it.

43
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
So let's set the stage.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
Who are these people who we're talking about?

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,800
Well, they're nerds on the internet who are typically straight, white, cis, young, and male.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,880
Not exclusively, granted, you know.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,480
For every one of those identifiers, you can find a few outliers,

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,200
but broadly, that's who we're dealing with.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,800
And to start off, let's try and get inside their mindset.

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
Now, this is something easy for me,

51
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,720
because I used to be one of these people until I grew out of it, you know?

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,600
If my parents had met five to ten years later,

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,240
I'd probably be watching alt-right YouTube videos and tweeting about Kekistan, whatever that's supposed to be.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,400
And that's a scary thought, you know?

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
There but for the grace of God, go I.

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,360
And here's the world according to the frog people.

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
First off, institutionalized prejudice is a thing of the past.

58
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,480
And indeed, if prejudice against minorities even exists at all anymore,

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,800
it's purely on an individual level.

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,520
It's a personal choice informed in no way by wider society.

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,560
And legality trumps all arguments here, you know?

62
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,720
Minorities have the vote now, and business discrimination is technically illegal.

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,680
Therefore, it doesn't happen outside of a few bad eggs.

64
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,960
Secondly, we live in a meritocracy.

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,920
If women get paid less than men, that's because they can't compete.

66
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,520
If black people get arrested and incarcerated disproportionately,

67
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
that's because they're more likely to be criminals.

68
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,080
Everyone is on equal footing now, you see.

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,600
And if anyone can't keep up with straight white men, well, that's just because they're not as good.

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,360
Now, most of them know not to say it this directly in the open, of course,

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
but basically this is what they believe.

72
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,720
And it stems, in part, I think, from a misunderstanding of history.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,280
If you don't know too much about history, it's hard to contextualize a lot of this stuff,

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
especially if you're a younger person.

75
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,680
Everything that happened before they were born took place sort of nebulously a long time ago,

76
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,160
and now it's all the same as ancient history.

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,800
It has no bearing at all on the modern day, or so it seems to them.

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,080
For example, it was not that long ago in my own life that I realized

79
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,680
how relatively recent legal slavery was in the West,

80
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,920
and the effects of that system are not something that disappear overnight, obviously.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,280
Similarly with women's suffrage and so on.

82
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,320
Speaking in terms of the span of human history, this all happened yesterday.

83
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,280
And another factor here is just the natural tendency

84
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,160
to want to see arguments break in your favor.

85
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,880
You know, it's much easier to believe in a meritocracy

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,600
if you're someone who is already doing okay.

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,240
Or rather, and it gets a little complicated here,

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,720
someone who is not doing okay, but feels like they should be,

89
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,480
and blames the fact that they're not on the enemies of the imaginary meritocracy.

90
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,840
You know, if the playing field is naturally already level,

91
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,440
then any attempt to advocate for any type of social minority

92
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,080
is coming directly and unfairly at the expense of straight white men.

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
You know, when is White History Month?

94
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,080
Why can't we have a straight Pride parade?

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,800
When is International Men's Day?

96
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,040
You see, to these young white guys, it seems like everyone else but them

97
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,640
has an identity that they're allowed to be openly proud of.

98
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,720
And that doesn't make sense if we're supposed to be on a level playing field.

99
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,760
You know, why is it that a black person or a gay person

100
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
can take pride in those identities,

101
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,800
but I'm not allowed to openly take pride in my race or my sexuality?

102
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,840
That's not fair.

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,880
Now, as a straight white man myself, I understand the answers to those questions,

104
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,200
but that understanding came at the tail end of a lot of learning and reading and contextualizing.

105
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,960
Perhaps more learning and contextualizing than it's reasonable to expect a teenager to have done,

106
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,680
especially considering the state of the education system in a lot of these places in the States,

107
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,440
but, you know, that's just the younger ones, I want to make clear.

108
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,160
Some of these guys are in their 30s and older, so I've got no sympathy at all for them.

109
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
Anyway, with these minority identities come narratives.

110
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,880
Narratives that include being oppressed and working to overcome that oppression.

111
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,240
And now, if we don't consider all the negatives of oppression,

112
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
you know, if we take the actual oppression out of oppression,

113
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
it can seem quite romantic.

114
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,880
You know, succeeding despite being the underdog is a lot more exciting and heroic,

115
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,720
narratively speaking, than succeeding when society expects you to succeed.

116
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,640
And among these young white men, there's definitely an unvoiced

117
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,080
and perhaps even subconscious jealousy of being left out of that narrative.

118
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,560
In fact, they share their identity with the oppressors in all of these narratives,

119
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,720
you know, white over black, straight over gay, cis over trans, men over women, and so on.

120
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,880
So it seems to them that they've been unfairly cast as the bad guy

121
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,800
without actually having done anything wrong as an individual.

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,880
So society, rather than being biased against people who aren't them,

123
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,040
is actually therefore biased against straight white men

124
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,480
who are not allowed to have an identity or a narrative.

125
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,640
And I'd just like to reiterate at this point that I don't agree with any of this,

126
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,480
and this is happening primarily in their own heads.

127
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,440
That's just to clarify for Jen if she's listening.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,480
Now, let's first position ourselves in time a couple of years ago,

129
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,760
and we've got a bunch of angry young white dudes on the internet

130
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,640
without much historical, economic, or political context with which to understand the world,

131
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,600
and they're feeling increasingly left out.

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,800
If something unfair or embarrassing or upsetting or disappointing happens to them,

133
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,000
they can't say, well, it's probably because I'm white or straight or a man.

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You know, there's no socially acceptable explanatory narrative at hand

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,760
for them to rationalize the negative aspects of their lives.

136
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,680
In fact, society is constantly signaling to them the opposite,

137
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,920
that they should be doing great, you know, you're the best, you should be on top,

138
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,640
but that's not how it feels to them.

139
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,160
And they can't openly bemoan the fate of straight white guys without being called idiot racists,

140
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
so what do they do?

141
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Well, they displace their anger and frustration onto the one other identity

142
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,560
that pretty much all young white men on the internet share.

143
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,640
They're all gamers.

144
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,880
They all play video games.

145
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,760
So, gamergate, where the gamers finally said,

146
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
We're not gonna take this anymore.

147
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,240
And everyone else said,

148
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,080
Take what anymore?

149
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
And the gamers replied,

150
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,800
We're not gonna take this anymore, but louder.

151
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,880
So I'm gonna say some things about gamers here, so full disclaimer,

152
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
I play video games.

153
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
I play video games.

154
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
I play too many video games.

155
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,080
But I've never really cared when someone insults capital-G gamers,

156
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,600
because video games are just a hobby for me, you know?

157
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,720
They're something I do for fun in my spare time.

158
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
Being a gamer is not my identity,

159
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
I don't define myself by the fact I play video games,

160
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,680
and nor should anyone else, but that's just me.

161
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Anyway, gamergate.

162
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,640
Now, my own experience of gamergate was to sit on the sidelines heckling

163
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,520
and metaphorically throwing rotten fruit at people.

164
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,200
Now, my guilty pleasure was going on Reddit or 4chan or something awful and asking,

165
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Hey, so what's this gamergate thing everyone's talking about?

166
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,680
You know, just to make everyone type huge text walls about what they thought gamergate was.

167
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,160
So for the blessedly uninitiated, what is gamergate?

168
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
Well, briefly, hopefully,

169
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,640
In mid-2014, independent game developer Zoe Quinn was the subject of a blog post

170
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,040
published by a former boyfriend that accused her of cheating on him with various men,

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,520
including a games journalist who had previously written about her and a video game she made.

172
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,920
So what does this incident have to do with anything?

173
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Who does it affect outside of the people directly personally involved?

174
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,160
The answers are nothing and nobody.

175
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
Of course, a couple had a messy breakup, basically,

176
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
but hey, something had to light this trash fire

177
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
and it wasn't going to be something legitimate, was it?

178
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,280
So we're stuck with this nonsense.

179
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,040
And if you think about it, the Zoe Quinn incident is sort of the perfect storm in a teacup,

180
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,560
to mix my idioms there.

181
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,400
It's a minor incident, but it's got a lot of contextual multipliers acting on it.

182
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,520
It's about a woman, which is a good start.

183
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,640
A woman game developer, so a woman trespassing in the No Women Treehouse.

184
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,000
She had sex, which is usually a frightening concept in and of itself for self-described gamers.

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,920
She allegedly cuckolded a man,

186
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,000
and of course, the most frightening type of sex a woman can have is sex that is not with me.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,360
And there's implicit fraud and deception proving true

188
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,640
all my suspicions about women being duplicitous harlots who'll deceive me at every turn.

189
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,280
And all of these multipliers act to make this remarkably trivial and stupid incident

190
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,320
actually significant in the minds of certain people.

191
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,040
And so they proceeded to organize on sites like Reddit, 4chan, 8chan and so on,

192
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,560
and built a movement primarily concerned with endless complaining about Zoe Quinn

193
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,800
and various other game developers and journalists who were apparently conspiring

194
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,080
to maliciously ruin video games for everyone using feminism.

195
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,040
Really though, Gamergate wasn't about Zoe Quinn or Anita Sarkeesian

196
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,840
or ethics in video game journalism,

197
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,520
which I think became a joke roughly five seconds after the first person even dared to suggest it.

198
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,000
It wasn't even really about video games.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,800
It was about young, straight white men and their lack of an identity.

200
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,320
In my opinion, anyway.

201
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,240
Gaming was the one area of entertainment that they felt was still created for them.

202
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,320
Of course, that's not true, but they felt it was true, which is the important thing.

203
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,920
You know, gaming, being the relative newcomer among television, films, books and the likes,

204
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,240
has been lagging behind somewhat in its representation of minorities.

205
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,160
And it's only fairly recently that people have been talking and writing about games

206
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,200
as if they're a real art form subject to real, thoughtful criticism.

207
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,600
Once almost exclusively the domain of young, white male nerds,

208
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,960
gaming's in the process of opening up to all sorts of players and all sorts of game developers

209
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,120
and all sorts of people writing about games and what they're like and what they could and should be.

210
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,360
And game developers are listening to all these people and games are changing.

211
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,520
Slowly, obviously, but they are.

212
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,160
Which poses a problem for the folks who had taken on Gamer as a surrogate identity.

213
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,360
You know, for young white guys, video games were a safe space

214
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,320
where you didn't have to deal with all these other people and all their different opinions and narratives

215
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,520
and now here they come, insisting that the thing you've adopted as the central pillar of your identity,

216
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:39,360
the only aspect of your identity that you feel comfortable actually openly enjoying, needs to change.

217
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,160
And they respond to this with a hysterical ferocity that can seem inexplicable

218
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,600
if you don't realize that in their heads they are a genuinely maligned minority.

219
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,960
It's every bit as serious to them as they imagine the civil rights marches were for black people

220
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,120
or the suffragette movement was for women.

221
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,880
It's ridiculous, obviously, but lacking an easily identifiable oppressor,

222
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,480
these young white men have simply fabricated one.

223
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,480
They've constructed a movement and us versus them.

224
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,400
Their narrative has become us versus the people who won't let us have a narrative.

225
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,720
Social justice warriors, feminists, whatever you want to call them.

226
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,840
They won't even let us play video games in peace anymore.

227
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,720
They hate us and want to change us just for being who we are, which means we're oppressed.

228
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,080
Finally.

229
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,880
So these communities exist now and they're backed into a corner in their own heads, you know.

230
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,840
Their gamer identities eroding under the horrific onslaught of

231
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,600
walking simulators about lesbians and relatively unobjectionable women saying they think

232
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,520
female soldiers should wear more than a bikini in a battle.

233
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,840
And it raises an interesting point.

234
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,720
It's always the minorities that get accused of being obsessed with feminism

235
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,920
and identity politics and so on, but in reality those things ultimately exist to level the playing field.

236
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,200
They're a means to an end, that end being equality.

237
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,560
Now, ostensibly, you'd think these straight white men

238
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,320
don't have to be concerned with all this stuff if they don't want to be, you know.

239
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,800
They don't have to go on about feminists online.

240
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,520
There's nothing keeping them here, really.

241
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,440
They can go and be free.

242
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,480
Become Randian supermen, you know, genius alpha male CEOs

243
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,400
or whatever it is they imagine they'd be in an ideal world.

244
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
But that's not happening, is it?

245
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,840
Because of course it's not.

246
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,160
We don't live in this ideal world.

247
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,960
We live in an often rubbish world.

248
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
So let's talk politics.

249
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,560
If you're age 18 to 26 in the United States,

250
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,360
then the only president you've known during your adult life has been until very recently Barack Obama.

251
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,640
The Bush administration is a distant memory by now.

252
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,840
If you voted for the first time you're able to in 2016,

253
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,560
then you were five when the Iraq war broke out.

254
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,280
That's scary, isn't it?

255
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,400
So a Democrat's been at the helm for eight years,

256
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,080
and yet there are all these problems still in society.

257
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,520
And of course there are excuses for the existence of all of these problems.

258
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,200
Perfectly legitimate excuses, even.

259
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,840
Obama came to power shortly after one of the worst economic downturns in a century.

260
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,720
You can blame Republican obstructionism, corporate lobbying,

261
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,520
the news media, capitalism in general.

262
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,200
And there's at least some merit in all of these factors, especially the economic ones.

263
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,480
There's something about huge layoffs and wage freezes

264
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,040
and bailouts that gets everybody down, societally speaking.

265
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,960
So what does this mean for our fresh-faced young white men?

266
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,520
Well, they don't want to be told that this is as good as it gets.

267
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,080
You know, tons of things suck under Obama,

268
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,200
but at least he's not doing as bad as a Republican.

269
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,840
You know, it's not much of a carrot, really, is it?

270
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,720
It's true, in a sense, but nobody's getting all that excited about it.

271
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,920
It's certainly not motivating a bunch of young white gamer dudes to go and vote for a woman,

272
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,720
that's for sure.

273
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,840
I mean, they haven't seen enough political cycles yet

274
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,720
to understand the only choice they have.

275
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,320
They've got the Republicans who have the image of being old, religious, stuffy, and uncool,

276
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,480
and the only other option seems to them to just be more of the same.

277
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,760
And in the boom years, the system can get away with this.

278
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,600
You know, people have jobs, they're earning money, things are ticking over.

279
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,600
But then inevitably, you get the bust years,

280
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,880
where suddenly young people's expectations and possibilities start diminishing.

281
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,720
You know, compared to their parents,

282
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,360
which is one of the main parameters by which their success in life is going to be judged,

283
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
it's more expensive to go to school, it's harder to get a job,

284
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,320
that job won't pay as much money, it's harder to afford a house.

285
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,920
And then when it comes voting time,

286
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,000
you have to choose between the people who are actively encouraging all of this

287
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,880
and the people who keep promising to fix it all,

288
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,680
but never actually seem to get around to doing it.

289
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,480
And both parties are staffed largely by people funded by the corporations

290
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,200
who have a stake in nothing being done.

291
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
This is not much of a choice.

292
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,440
Now, a little disclaimer here,

293
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,240
I'm not saying both parties are the same.

294
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,960
They're not.

295
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,760
Particularly if you're anything but a straight white man,

296
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,080
it is massively in your interest to vote against the Republicans.

297
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,360
The Democrats' action on minority rights is rather lackluster, actually, in my opinion,

298
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,560
but it's better than the open hostility of the Republicans.

299
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,880
For straight white men, however, it is easy to see why so many were suckered in by Trump.

300
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,560
You know, there's the obvious.

301
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,920
He positioned himself as an anti-establishment candidate

302
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,960
in a year where establishment candidates were incredibly unpopular.

303
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,240
He attacked the usual stable of Republicans running,

304
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,120
said he was gonna drain the swamp, and so on.

305
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,800
Rarely, though, for our young white guys we're talking about,

306
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,240
I don't think that Trump's political positions were all that important

307
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,800
compared to what Trump represented.

308
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,720
He was a fantasy, in a sense,

309
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,960
because he was a white man who said whatever he wanted to,

310
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,160
and he got away with it.

311
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
He would openly pander to bigoted white people,

312
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,960
and there's a big market for that lately, as it turns out.

313
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,800
His ideas are all laughable, practically speaking, anyway.

314
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,160
A Muslim ban, a big wall to keep foreigners out.

315
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,440
It's cartoonish and ridiculous, clearly, but none of that matters.

316
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,280
Trump was a white man sticking up for white men

317
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
when it seemed like no one else would.

318
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
Make America Great Again.

319
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,160
You know, when? When was it great?

320
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,000
If you're not a straight white guy, then the further you go into America's past,

321
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,520
the worse it gets.

322
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,360
Make America Great Again is a threat to most people.

323
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,760
Now, I spend a fair bit of time listening in on the Discord server

324
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,960
for the Reddit page for Donald Trump supporters.

325
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,520
That's r slash The Donald.

326
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,880
And I won't go into it too much right now, but, you know,

327
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,040
as you can see here, well, you get the picture.

328
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,640
The talk is openly racist, worrying about the future of the white race,

329
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,160
using all the racial slurs under the sun.

330
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,680
And I've had a few people tell me,

331
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,080
oh, well, this isn't serious, you know.

332
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,840
They just like his policies and all this race talk is just a joke.

333
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
But, honestly, get a grip.

334
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,640
If you think this is just a joke, then you've been tricked.

335
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,560
It's amazing, I know, but racism actually still exists,

336
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,440
and it's coming back in fashion.

337
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,840
Now, over the course of Trump's term, or terms, in office,

338
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,520
a lot of these kids are gonna drift away from supporting him

339
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,560
as they realize he actually is just a politician

340
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,440
who spun them a bunch of crap in order to get elected.

341
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,840
And this brings us back around to where we started

342
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,920
with the first bunch of suckers

343
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
slowly coming around to the fact that they've been conned.

344
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,480
So, what's next?

345
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,360
What's gonna happen from here on out?

346
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,840
Well, it's not enough for these people to just stop supporting Trump anymore.

347
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,440
You know, the legitimization of Trump's rhetoric has already happened.

348
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,760
Trump won't be the last, regardless of how he performs in office.

349
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,840
A lot of potential future candidates will have been watching his rise to power

350
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,440
and taking notes.

351
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,560
And if I were doing that,

352
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,200
then point 1A on my list of tips to get elected would say,

353
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,520
you do not have to hide it anymore.

354
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,240
You know, the fascists have come out of the woodwork now.

355
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,720
The white nationalist narrative is running at full steam online,

356
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,760
and many young white guys are flocking to it.

357
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,920
You know, we are past that point by now.

358
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,360
I hope we can all agree.

359
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,280
A cleverer person than me could write an interesting paper

360
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,720
about how memes and icons and emojis

361
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,280
have taken the place of the uniform, the pin and the armband and so on

362
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,560
as the signifiers of a political movement.

363
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,640
Now, these people will mostly all abandon Trump eventually,

364
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,280
not because they've had a change of heart necessarily,

365
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,160
but because they'll find him a disappointment.

366
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,080
He won't drain the swamp or make America great again,

367
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,320
and they'll all move on to someone else,

368
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,280
promising the same things, but even bigger.

369
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,840
So my question going forward is, what can we do about these people, you know?

370
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,160
How can we break them out of the spell of this resurgent white nationalism

371
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,640
with its easy, racialized answers for all the world's problems?

372
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,160
Because that's the thing.

373
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,120
It is easy.

374
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,280
It's comparatively difficult to learn about the economy, for instance,

375
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,560
and how that operates,

376
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,520
but white nationalists look at complicated systemic problems like that

377
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,320
and make them simple racial problems.

378
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,960
You know, it's not our banking system that's broken.

379
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,120
It's the Jews, for example.

380
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,720
It's not the justice system.

381
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,800
It's a problem with black people.

382
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,320
It's not immigration law or foreign policy.

383
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,840
It's the Muslims.

384
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,720
You know, if we just get rid of X type of person,

385
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
then the relevant problem will go away.

386
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
And combating this is difficult.

387
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,840
It requires more effort to properly understand these issues

388
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,320
than it does to believe the easy lie.

389
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,200
So we're starting out on the back foot here,

390
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,000
and you'd have to have some inhuman amount of belief

391
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
in the fundamental goodness of humanity

392
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,000
to think that all of these guys could simply be talked down

393
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,080
from the white nationalist ledge.

394
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,960
Though on the other hand, I'm sure a lot can,

395
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,200
and I'm sure many will grow out of it,

396
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
and I'd argue that as they become increasingly disillusioned with Trump

397
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,160
over the next four years,

398
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,960
it's a prime opportunity to try and change their minds.

399
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,160
Though honestly, I don't blame anyone who doesn't have the patience

400
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,200
to argue endlessly with the little pricks.

401
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,520
It's like running on a treadmill, you know?

402
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,280
It feels like you get nowhere.

403
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,720
Now I don't know how to ultimately solve this problem,

404
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,600
but I do have one suggestion I think could help.

405
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,120
They could really use another political narrative to get behind.

406
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,640
You know, the popularity of Bernie Sanders, say,

407
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,120
definitely proved at least the desire for a more left-leaning platform from the Democrats,

408
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,720
which the Democrats themselves are now ignoring as much as possible

409
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
instead of capitalizing on.

410
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,320
There are even some people who swapped from supporting Sanders

411
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,960
to supporting Trump when Sanders dropped out,

412
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,360
which seems like an inexplicable position if you're focused on policy.

413
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,440
It's ridiculous, but it actually kind of makes sense

414
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,680
if you think in terms of the narrative of the political outsider.

415
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,120
There's a hunger for politics that differ from the mainstream,

416
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,560
and the actual specifics of how they differ from the mainstream

417
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,040
seems not to matter to some people.

418
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,400
And there's a way, I feel, to appeal directly to the part of these young white guys

419
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,560
that subconsciously maybe wants to be part of an oppressed movement.

420
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,440
And it's ironic because, economically, the answer's right there in front of them.

421
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,760
They have no choice but to take part in an impressive economic system

422
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,880
that's heavily biased in favor of the rich.

423
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,560
The lack of a political identity that some young white men feel

424
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,760
could ideally be filled with a class identity.

425
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,160
You know, still talking about real problems,

426
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,200
but through an actually helpful economic lens

427
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,480
instead of a misleading and bigoted racial one.

428
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,840
Criticizing capitalism is kind of a hard sell in the States, though, I understand.

429
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,680
And I'll throw it open to the comments.

430
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,920
You know, what else can we do to re-educate these people out of their white nationalism?

431
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,080
And yes, I said re-educate. I want to re-educate you.

432
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,360
You gave it a go by yourself, but you fucked up,

433
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,200
and now your brain is wrong and needs to be reprogrammed.

434
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,920
Because ultimately, if this doesn't stop, it's gonna come to blows.

435
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,280
And I don't mean a street scuffle between a group of anti-fascists

436
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,040
and a group of white nationalists,

437
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,800
but potentially, you know, well, if this movement doesn't fizzle out by itself,

438
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,600
it'll eventually end up being stamped out.

439
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,840
And it'd be better to solve all this with words before it comes to that.

440
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,240
Because the white nationalists will definitely lose that fight if it happens,

441
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,760
just like they did last time.

442
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,880
It's an ideology that is destined to lose.

443
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,680
So I'll leave you today with a warning

444
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,960
for any of my fellow straight white gamer dudes who are listening.

445
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:53,200
It honestly really is in your best interests to stay away from the old fascism there.

446
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,240
It never turns out like they say it will, I promise.

447
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,440
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

448
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,520
Let me know what you think in the comments, please.

449
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,600
I'd like to hear your feedback on this one.

450
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,080
And you can get in touch with me on Twitter or Curious Cat if you want to ask a question.

451
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,320
If you liked this video and would like to help me make more videos,

452
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,880
consider pledging me a dollar on Patreon.

453
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
I don't run advertisements on my videos at all,

454
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,240
and ideally, I'd like to keep it that way.

455
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
However, sadly, I do still need to eat.

456
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,440
And it turns out they don't let you opt out of paying for food

457
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,760
just because you don't like capitalism.

458
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,560
If you're broke right now and you can't afford to pledge anything,

459
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,760
I also accept payment in the form of photographs of genitals.

460
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:45,040
I'm really kidding.

461
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,560
Please do not send me photographs of your genitals.
