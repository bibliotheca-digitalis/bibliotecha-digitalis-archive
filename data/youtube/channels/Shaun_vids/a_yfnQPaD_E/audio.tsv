0	4840	Hello, everyone. So, today, I want to talk about white identity.
4840	8120	Now, one question I get a lot on my Curious Cat page is,
8120	14520	are you worried about the prevalence of white nationalist rhetoric among younger white men online?
14520	17240	And my answer is always, yes, I am.
17240	22080	But today, I thought I'd flesh that answer out a bit and discuss these young white guys
22080	26080	and their increasing familiarity with open white nationalism.
26080	28080	And we're gonna tell a bit of a story.
28080	33520	We're gonna talk about how this identity coalesced and gained steam during Gamergate,
33520	40000	and how it transformed into the Pepe avatar alt-right Trump-supporting mess it is today.
40000	45760	And the reason I really want to talk about this now is that I've been noticing a certain dissatisfaction with Trump
45760	50080	among a lot of the frogs, and many of them, understandably, don't seem too happy
50080	54160	with the general level of ineptitude he's displayed since coming to office.
54160	58880	And many others are even openly expressing regret for even having voted for him.
58880	65600	You know, you've got the usual Pepe avatar people, the folks using the frog emoji in their Twitter names,
65600	73520	and Trump's also apparently lost the support of Darth Vader, Frankenstein's monster, and Skeletor.
73520	79040	So I also want to ask, how did all of these chumps get hoodwinked so easily?
79040	83600	And once they all wake up to the fact that Trump was just using them all along,
83840	85840	where are they gonna go next?
85840	88720	Now, a few disclaimers before we start.
88720	94720	Unlike some people, I don't think Gamergate caused Trump to become president or anything, you know?
94720	98480	While there was a small swing away from the Democrats among younger people,
99120	101680	and of course Trump was definitely favored by white men,
102240	108560	I don't really think any of these Pepe memes or the likes really affected the outcome of the election that much.
108560	112480	We're giving them too much credit, I think, when we suggest that.
112560	113760	Another disclaimer.
113760	116240	This video is not a defense of these guys.
116240	121600	When I ran this idea past Jen, she thought it sounded like I was making excuses for them.
122320	123600	And I don't want to do that.
123600	129120	I'd like to try and explain their behavior and motivations, but not excuse their actions.
129120	131200	So I thought I'd just make that clear here.
131760	135120	I apologize if it seems like I'm giving them an easy ride.
135120	137360	And a final thing before we start.
137360	141120	I'd like to say hello to any of these people who are watching.
141840	142560	Hello there.
143440	148000	Thanks for stopping by to hit dislike and call me a cuck, and so on.
148000	150160	But once you're done with that though,
150160	155600	I would encourage you to stick around and watch the rest of the video just for a change of pace, if nothing else.
156640	160960	Right now, you won't agree with anything I say, and you'll think I'm an idiot.
160960	165360	But it'll plant a few seeds in your head that will slowly come to fruition.
165360	170480	And eventually, in about two or three years, you'll realize that I was right about everything.
171120	172640	That's the hope, anyway.
172640	174480	Anyway, let's get to it.
174480	175840	So let's set the stage.
176480	179120	Who are these people who we're talking about?
179120	186800	Well, they're nerds on the internet who are typically straight, white, cis, young, and male.
187840	190880	Not exclusively, granted, you know.
190880	194480	For every one of those identifiers, you can find a few outliers,
194480	197200	but broadly, that's who we're dealing with.
197200	200800	And to start off, let's try and get inside their mindset.
200800	202640	Now, this is something easy for me,
202640	206720	because I used to be one of these people until I grew out of it, you know?
206720	209600	If my parents had met five to ten years later,
209600	216240	I'd probably be watching alt-right YouTube videos and tweeting about Kekistan, whatever that's supposed to be.
216240	218400	And that's a scary thought, you know?
218400	221200	There but for the grace of God, go I.
221200	225360	And here's the world according to the frog people.
225360	229360	First off, institutionalized prejudice is a thing of the past.
229440	234480	And indeed, if prejudice against minorities even exists at all anymore,
234480	236800	it's purely on an individual level.
236800	241520	It's a personal choice informed in no way by wider society.
241520	244560	And legality trumps all arguments here, you know?
244560	248720	Minorities have the vote now, and business discrimination is technically illegal.
249280	253680	Therefore, it doesn't happen outside of a few bad eggs.
254640	256960	Secondly, we live in a meritocracy.
257600	261920	If women get paid less than men, that's because they can't compete.
261920	265520	If black people get arrested and incarcerated disproportionately,
265520	268400	that's because they're more likely to be criminals.
269200	272080	Everyone is on equal footing now, you see.
272080	277600	And if anyone can't keep up with straight white men, well, that's just because they're not as good.
277600	281360	Now, most of them know not to say it this directly in the open, of course,
281360	284000	but basically this is what they believe.
284080	288720	And it stems, in part, I think, from a misunderstanding of history.
288720	293280	If you don't know too much about history, it's hard to contextualize a lot of this stuff,
293280	295440	especially if you're a younger person.
295440	301680	Everything that happened before they were born took place sort of nebulously a long time ago,
301680	304160	and now it's all the same as ancient history.
304160	308800	It has no bearing at all on the modern day, or so it seems to them.
308800	312080	For example, it was not that long ago in my own life that I realized
312080	315680	how relatively recent legal slavery was in the West,
315680	319920	and the effects of that system are not something that disappear overnight, obviously.
320720	323280	Similarly with women's suffrage and so on.
323280	328320	Speaking in terms of the span of human history, this all happened yesterday.
328320	331280	And another factor here is just the natural tendency
331280	334160	to want to see arguments break in your favor.
334160	336880	You know, it's much easier to believe in a meritocracy
336880	339600	if you're someone who is already doing okay.
340560	344240	Or rather, and it gets a little complicated here,
344240	348720	someone who is not doing okay, but feels like they should be,
348720	354480	and blames the fact that they're not on the enemies of the imaginary meritocracy.
354480	357840	You know, if the playing field is naturally already level,
357840	361440	then any attempt to advocate for any type of social minority
361440	366080	is coming directly and unfairly at the expense of straight white men.
366720	369520	You know, when is White History Month?
369520	372080	Why can't we have a straight Pride parade?
372080	374800	When is International Men's Day?
374800	379040	You see, to these young white guys, it seems like everyone else but them
379040	382640	has an identity that they're allowed to be openly proud of.
383280	386720	And that doesn't make sense if we're supposed to be on a level playing field.
386720	389760	You know, why is it that a black person or a gay person
389760	391760	can take pride in those identities,
391760	396800	but I'm not allowed to openly take pride in my race or my sexuality?
396800	397840	That's not fair.
398400	402880	Now, as a straight white man myself, I understand the answers to those questions,
402880	409200	but that understanding came at the tail end of a lot of learning and reading and contextualizing.
409200	414960	Perhaps more learning and contextualizing than it's reasonable to expect a teenager to have done,
414960	419680	especially considering the state of the education system in a lot of these places in the States,
419680	423440	but, you know, that's just the younger ones, I want to make clear.
423440	428160	Some of these guys are in their 30s and older, so I've got no sympathy at all for them.
428720	432960	Anyway, with these minority identities come narratives.
433680	438880	Narratives that include being oppressed and working to overcome that oppression.
438880	442240	And now, if we don't consider all the negatives of oppression,
442880	446000	you know, if we take the actual oppression out of oppression,
446880	448960	it can seem quite romantic.
448960	454880	You know, succeeding despite being the underdog is a lot more exciting and heroic,
454880	460720	narratively speaking, than succeeding when society expects you to succeed.
461280	464640	And among these young white men, there's definitely an unvoiced
464640	470080	and perhaps even subconscious jealousy of being left out of that narrative.
470080	474560	In fact, they share their identity with the oppressors in all of these narratives,
474560	480720	you know, white over black, straight over gay, cis over trans, men over women, and so on.
480720	484880	So it seems to them that they've been unfairly cast as the bad guy
484880	488800	without actually having done anything wrong as an individual.
488800	492880	So society, rather than being biased against people who aren't them,
493440	497040	is actually therefore biased against straight white men
497040	500480	who are not allowed to have an identity or a narrative.
500480	504640	And I'd just like to reiterate at this point that I don't agree with any of this,
504640	508480	and this is happening primarily in their own heads.
508480	511440	That's just to clarify for Jen if she's listening.
512000	516480	Now, let's first position ourselves in time a couple of years ago,
516480	519760	and we've got a bunch of angry young white dudes on the internet
519760	524640	without much historical, economic, or political context with which to understand the world,
525360	527600	and they're feeling increasingly left out.
527600	532800	If something unfair or embarrassing or upsetting or disappointing happens to them,
532800	538000	they can't say, well, it's probably because I'm white or straight or a man.
538000	542000	You know, there's no socially acceptable explanatory narrative at hand
542000	545760	for them to rationalize the negative aspects of their lives.
545760	549680	In fact, society is constantly signaling to them the opposite,
549680	553920	that they should be doing great, you know, you're the best, you should be on top,
553920	556640	but that's not how it feels to them.
556640	562160	And they can't openly bemoan the fate of straight white guys without being called idiot racists,
562160	563600	so what do they do?
564240	569600	Well, they displace their anger and frustration onto the one other identity
569600	572560	that pretty much all young white men on the internet share.
573440	574640	They're all gamers.
575200	576880	They all play video games.
578160	581760	So, gamergate, where the gamers finally said,
582400	584400	We're not gonna take this anymore.
585040	586240	And everyone else said,
588240	590080	Take what anymore?
590800	592160	And the gamers replied,
593120	596800	We're not gonna take this anymore, but louder.
597360	600880	So I'm gonna say some things about gamers here, so full disclaimer,
600880	602320	I play video games.
603040	604640	I play video games.
604640	607600	I play too many video games.
607600	612080	But I've never really cared when someone insults capital-G gamers,
612080	615600	because video games are just a hobby for me, you know?
615600	618720	They're something I do for fun in my spare time.
618720	621120	Being a gamer is not my identity,
621120	624720	I don't define myself by the fact I play video games,
624720	627680	and nor should anyone else, but that's just me.
628480	630480	Anyway, gamergate.
630480	634640	Now, my own experience of gamergate was to sit on the sidelines heckling
634640	637520	and metaphorically throwing rotten fruit at people.
637520	643200	Now, my guilty pleasure was going on Reddit or 4chan or something awful and asking,
643200	647200	Hey, so what's this gamergate thing everyone's talking about?
647200	651680	You know, just to make everyone type huge text walls about what they thought gamergate was.
652480	658160	So for the blessedly uninitiated, what is gamergate?
658160	659920	Well, briefly, hopefully,
660720	666640	In mid-2014, independent game developer Zoe Quinn was the subject of a blog post
666640	671040	published by a former boyfriend that accused her of cheating on him with various men,
672000	677520	including a games journalist who had previously written about her and a video game she made.
678080	681920	So what does this incident have to do with anything?
681920	686480	Who does it affect outside of the people directly personally involved?
687280	690160	The answers are nothing and nobody.
690160	693360	Of course, a couple had a messy breakup, basically,
693360	696560	but hey, something had to light this trash fire
696560	699040	and it wasn't going to be something legitimate, was it?
699040	701280	So we're stuck with this nonsense.
701280	707040	And if you think about it, the Zoe Quinn incident is sort of the perfect storm in a teacup,
707040	708560	to mix my idioms there.
709120	714400	It's a minor incident, but it's got a lot of contextual multipliers acting on it.
714400	717520	It's about a woman, which is a good start.
717520	722640	A woman game developer, so a woman trespassing in the No Women Treehouse.
723360	730000	She had sex, which is usually a frightening concept in and of itself for self-described gamers.
730000	731920	She allegedly cuckolded a man,
732480	738000	and of course, the most frightening type of sex a woman can have is sex that is not with me.
738000	741360	And there's implicit fraud and deception proving true
741360	746640	all my suspicions about women being duplicitous harlots who'll deceive me at every turn.
746640	751280	And all of these multipliers act to make this remarkably trivial and stupid incident
751280	754320	actually significant in the minds of certain people.
754320	761040	And so they proceeded to organize on sites like Reddit, 4chan, 8chan and so on,
761040	766560	and built a movement primarily concerned with endless complaining about Zoe Quinn
766560	770800	and various other game developers and journalists who were apparently conspiring
770800	776080	to maliciously ruin video games for everyone using feminism.
776080	781040	Really though, Gamergate wasn't about Zoe Quinn or Anita Sarkeesian
781040	783840	or ethics in video game journalism,
783840	789520	which I think became a joke roughly five seconds after the first person even dared to suggest it.
789520	792000	It wasn't even really about video games.
792000	796800	It was about young, straight white men and their lack of an identity.
796800	798320	In my opinion, anyway.
798880	804240	Gaming was the one area of entertainment that they felt was still created for them.
804240	808320	Of course, that's not true, but they felt it was true, which is the important thing.
808320	813920	You know, gaming, being the relative newcomer among television, films, books and the likes,
813920	818240	has been lagging behind somewhat in its representation of minorities.
818240	822160	And it's only fairly recently that people have been talking and writing about games
822160	827200	as if they're a real art form subject to real, thoughtful criticism.
827200	831600	Once almost exclusively the domain of young, white male nerds,
831600	836960	gaming's in the process of opening up to all sorts of players and all sorts of game developers
836960	843120	and all sorts of people writing about games and what they're like and what they could and should be.
843120	847360	And game developers are listening to all these people and games are changing.
847360	849520	Slowly, obviously, but they are.
850240	856160	Which poses a problem for the folks who had taken on Gamer as a surrogate identity.
856160	859360	You know, for young white guys, video games were a safe space
859360	864320	where you didn't have to deal with all these other people and all their different opinions and narratives
864320	871520	and now here they come, insisting that the thing you've adopted as the central pillar of your identity,
871520	879360	the only aspect of your identity that you feel comfortable actually openly enjoying, needs to change.
879360	884160	And they respond to this with a hysterical ferocity that can seem inexplicable
884160	889600	if you don't realize that in their heads they are a genuinely maligned minority.
889600	894960	It's every bit as serious to them as they imagine the civil rights marches were for black people
894960	897120	or the suffragette movement was for women.
897840	902880	It's ridiculous, obviously, but lacking an easily identifiable oppressor,
902880	906480	these young white men have simply fabricated one.
906480	910480	They've constructed a movement and us versus them.
910560	916400	Their narrative has become us versus the people who won't let us have a narrative.
916400	920720	Social justice warriors, feminists, whatever you want to call them.
920720	923840	They won't even let us play video games in peace anymore.
924480	930720	They hate us and want to change us just for being who we are, which means we're oppressed.
931440	932080	Finally.
933040	938880	So these communities exist now and they're backed into a corner in their own heads, you know.
939520	943840	Their gamer identities eroding under the horrific onslaught of
943840	949600	walking simulators about lesbians and relatively unobjectionable women saying they think
949600	953520	female soldiers should wear more than a bikini in a battle.
953520	955840	And it raises an interesting point.
955840	960720	It's always the minorities that get accused of being obsessed with feminism
960720	967920	and identity politics and so on, but in reality those things ultimately exist to level the playing field.
967920	971200	They're a means to an end, that end being equality.
971200	974560	Now, ostensibly, you'd think these straight white men
974560	978320	don't have to be concerned with all this stuff if they don't want to be, you know.
978320	980800	They don't have to go on about feminists online.
980800	983520	There's nothing keeping them here, really.
983520	985440	They can go and be free.
985440	990480	Become Randian supermen, you know, genius alpha male CEOs
990480	994400	or whatever it is they imagine they'd be in an ideal world.
994480	996160	But that's not happening, is it?
996160	997840	Because of course it's not.
997840	1000160	We don't live in this ideal world.
1000160	1002960	We live in an often rubbish world.
1002960	1004960	So let's talk politics.
1005600	1008560	If you're age 18 to 26 in the United States,
1008560	1015360	then the only president you've known during your adult life has been until very recently Barack Obama.
1015360	1018640	The Bush administration is a distant memory by now.
1018640	1021840	If you voted for the first time you're able to in 2016,
1021840	1024560	then you were five when the Iraq war broke out.
1025600	1027280	That's scary, isn't it?
1027280	1030400	So a Democrat's been at the helm for eight years,
1030400	1034080	and yet there are all these problems still in society.
1034080	1037520	And of course there are excuses for the existence of all of these problems.
1038400	1041200	Perfectly legitimate excuses, even.
1041200	1045840	Obama came to power shortly after one of the worst economic downturns in a century.
1046560	1050720	You can blame Republican obstructionism, corporate lobbying,
1050720	1053520	the news media, capitalism in general.
1054240	1059200	And there's at least some merit in all of these factors, especially the economic ones.
1059200	1062480	There's something about huge layoffs and wage freezes
1062480	1067040	and bailouts that gets everybody down, societally speaking.
1067040	1070960	So what does this mean for our fresh-faced young white men?
1070960	1075520	Well, they don't want to be told that this is as good as it gets.
1075520	1078080	You know, tons of things suck under Obama,
1078080	1081200	but at least he's not doing as bad as a Republican.
1081200	1083840	You know, it's not much of a carrot, really, is it?
1083840	1088720	It's true, in a sense, but nobody's getting all that excited about it.
1088720	1093920	It's certainly not motivating a bunch of young white gamer dudes to go and vote for a woman,
1093920	1094720	that's for sure.
1094720	1097840	I mean, they haven't seen enough political cycles yet
1097840	1100720	to understand the only choice they have.
1100720	1106320	They've got the Republicans who have the image of being old, religious, stuffy, and uncool,
1106320	1110480	and the only other option seems to them to just be more of the same.
1110480	1113760	And in the boom years, the system can get away with this.
1113760	1117600	You know, people have jobs, they're earning money, things are ticking over.
1118320	1121600	But then inevitably, you get the bust years,
1121600	1126880	where suddenly young people's expectations and possibilities start diminishing.
1126880	1128720	You know, compared to their parents,
1128720	1133360	which is one of the main parameters by which their success in life is going to be judged,
1134000	1138000	it's more expensive to go to school, it's harder to get a job,
1138000	1142320	that job won't pay as much money, it's harder to afford a house.
1142320	1143920	And then when it comes voting time,
1143920	1148000	you have to choose between the people who are actively encouraging all of this
1148000	1150880	and the people who keep promising to fix it all,
1150880	1153680	but never actually seem to get around to doing it.
1153680	1158480	And both parties are staffed largely by people funded by the corporations
1158480	1161200	who have a stake in nothing being done.
1161200	1162880	This is not much of a choice.
1163600	1165440	Now, a little disclaimer here,
1165440	1168240	I'm not saying both parties are the same.
1168240	1168960	They're not.
1168960	1171760	Particularly if you're anything but a straight white man,
1171760	1176080	it is massively in your interest to vote against the Republicans.
1176080	1181360	The Democrats' action on minority rights is rather lackluster, actually, in my opinion,
1181360	1184560	but it's better than the open hostility of the Republicans.
1185200	1190880	For straight white men, however, it is easy to see why so many were suckered in by Trump.
1190880	1192560	You know, there's the obvious.
1192560	1195920	He positioned himself as an anti-establishment candidate
1195920	1200960	in a year where establishment candidates were incredibly unpopular.
1200960	1204240	He attacked the usual stable of Republicans running,
1204240	1207120	said he was gonna drain the swamp, and so on.
1207920	1210800	Rarely, though, for our young white guys we're talking about,
1210800	1214240	I don't think that Trump's political positions were all that important
1214240	1216800	compared to what Trump represented.
1216800	1218720	He was a fantasy, in a sense,
1218720	1222960	because he was a white man who said whatever he wanted to,
1222960	1224160	and he got away with it.
1224720	1227760	He would openly pander to bigoted white people,
1227760	1230960	and there's a big market for that lately, as it turns out.
1230960	1234800	His ideas are all laughable, practically speaking, anyway.
1234800	1238160	A Muslim ban, a big wall to keep foreigners out.
1238160	1243440	It's cartoonish and ridiculous, clearly, but none of that matters.
1243440	1247280	Trump was a white man sticking up for white men
1247280	1249600	when it seemed like no one else would.
1249600	1251280	Make America Great Again.
1251840	1254160	You know, when? When was it great?
1254160	1258000	If you're not a straight white guy, then the further you go into America's past,
1258000	1259520	the worse it gets.
1259520	1263360	Make America Great Again is a threat to most people.
1263920	1267760	Now, I spend a fair bit of time listening in on the Discord server
1267760	1270960	for the Reddit page for Donald Trump supporters.
1270960	1273520	That's r slash The Donald.
1273520	1276880	And I won't go into it too much right now, but, you know,
1276880	1281040	as you can see here, well, you get the picture.
1281040	1286640	The talk is openly racist, worrying about the future of the white race,
1287440	1290160	using all the racial slurs under the sun.
1290160	1291680	And I've had a few people tell me,
1291680	1294080	oh, well, this isn't serious, you know.
1294080	1297840	They just like his policies and all this race talk is just a joke.
1297840	1301200	But, honestly, get a grip.
1301200	1304640	If you think this is just a joke, then you've been tricked.
1304640	1308560	It's amazing, I know, but racism actually still exists,
1309120	1311440	and it's coming back in fashion.
1311440	1315840	Now, over the course of Trump's term, or terms, in office,
1316720	1319520	a lot of these kids are gonna drift away from supporting him
1319520	1322560	as they realize he actually is just a politician
1322560	1325440	who spun them a bunch of crap in order to get elected.
1325440	1327840	And this brings us back around to where we started
1327840	1329920	with the first bunch of suckers
1329920	1332480	slowly coming around to the fact that they've been conned.
1333120	1334480	So, what's next?
1335120	1337360	What's gonna happen from here on out?
1337360	1343840	Well, it's not enough for these people to just stop supporting Trump anymore.
1343840	1347440	You know, the legitimization of Trump's rhetoric has already happened.
1347440	1351760	Trump won't be the last, regardless of how he performs in office.
1351760	1355840	A lot of potential future candidates will have been watching his rise to power
1355840	1357440	and taking notes.
1357440	1358560	And if I were doing that,
1358560	1363200	then point 1A on my list of tips to get elected would say,
1363200	1365520	you do not have to hide it anymore.
1365520	1368240	You know, the fascists have come out of the woodwork now.
1368240	1372720	The white nationalist narrative is running at full steam online,
1372720	1375760	and many young white guys are flocking to it.
1375760	1377920	You know, we are past that point by now.
1377920	1379360	I hope we can all agree.
1380240	1383280	A cleverer person than me could write an interesting paper
1383280	1386720	about how memes and icons and emojis
1386720	1391280	have taken the place of the uniform, the pin and the armband and so on
1391280	1394560	as the signifiers of a political movement.
1394560	1398640	Now, these people will mostly all abandon Trump eventually,
1398640	1401280	not because they've had a change of heart necessarily,
1401280	1404160	but because they'll find him a disappointment.
1404160	1408080	He won't drain the swamp or make America great again,
1408080	1410320	and they'll all move on to someone else,
1410320	1413280	promising the same things, but even bigger.
1413280	1417840	So my question going forward is, what can we do about these people, you know?
1417840	1422160	How can we break them out of the spell of this resurgent white nationalism
1422160	1426640	with its easy, racialized answers for all the world's problems?
1426640	1428160	Because that's the thing.
1428160	1429120	It is easy.
1429120	1433280	It's comparatively difficult to learn about the economy, for instance,
1433280	1434560	and how that operates,
1434560	1439520	but white nationalists look at complicated systemic problems like that
1439520	1442320	and make them simple racial problems.
1442320	1444960	You know, it's not our banking system that's broken.
1444960	1447120	It's the Jews, for example.
1447120	1448720	It's not the justice system.
1448720	1450800	It's a problem with black people.
1450800	1454320	It's not immigration law or foreign policy.
1454320	1455840	It's the Muslims.
1455840	1458720	You know, if we just get rid of X type of person,
1458720	1460960	then the relevant problem will go away.
1461600	1464000	And combating this is difficult.
1464000	1467840	It requires more effort to properly understand these issues
1467840	1470320	than it does to believe the easy lie.
1470320	1473200	So we're starting out on the back foot here,
1473200	1476000	and you'd have to have some inhuman amount of belief
1476000	1478080	in the fundamental goodness of humanity
1478080	1482000	to think that all of these guys could simply be talked down
1482000	1484080	from the white nationalist ledge.
1484080	1486960	Though on the other hand, I'm sure a lot can,
1486960	1489200	and I'm sure many will grow out of it,
1489200	1492880	and I'd argue that as they become increasingly disillusioned with Trump
1492880	1494160	over the next four years,
1494160	1498960	it's a prime opportunity to try and change their minds.
1498960	1502160	Though honestly, I don't blame anyone who doesn't have the patience
1502160	1505200	to argue endlessly with the little pricks.
1505200	1507520	It's like running on a treadmill, you know?
1507520	1509280	It feels like you get nowhere.
1509280	1512720	Now I don't know how to ultimately solve this problem,
1512720	1515600	but I do have one suggestion I think could help.
1516400	1521120	They could really use another political narrative to get behind.
1521120	1524640	You know, the popularity of Bernie Sanders, say,
1525440	1531120	definitely proved at least the desire for a more left-leaning platform from the Democrats,
1531120	1534720	which the Democrats themselves are now ignoring as much as possible
1534720	1536720	instead of capitalizing on.
1536720	1540320	There are even some people who swapped from supporting Sanders
1540320	1542960	to supporting Trump when Sanders dropped out,
1542960	1547360	which seems like an inexplicable position if you're focused on policy.
1548080	1551440	It's ridiculous, but it actually kind of makes sense
1551440	1555680	if you think in terms of the narrative of the political outsider.
1555680	1559120	There's a hunger for politics that differ from the mainstream,
1559120	1562560	and the actual specifics of how they differ from the mainstream
1562560	1565040	seems not to matter to some people.
1565040	1570400	And there's a way, I feel, to appeal directly to the part of these young white guys
1570400	1574560	that subconsciously maybe wants to be part of an oppressed movement.
1574560	1579440	And it's ironic because, economically, the answer's right there in front of them.
1579440	1583760	They have no choice but to take part in an impressive economic system
1583760	1586880	that's heavily biased in favor of the rich.
1586880	1590560	The lack of a political identity that some young white men feel
1590560	1593760	could ideally be filled with a class identity.
1593760	1596160	You know, still talking about real problems,
1596160	1599200	but through an actually helpful economic lens
1599200	1602480	instead of a misleading and bigoted racial one.
1602480	1607840	Criticizing capitalism is kind of a hard sell in the States, though, I understand.
1607920	1609680	And I'll throw it open to the comments.
1609680	1615920	You know, what else can we do to re-educate these people out of their white nationalism?
1615920	1620080	And yes, I said re-educate. I want to re-educate you.
1620080	1623360	You gave it a go by yourself, but you fucked up,
1623360	1627200	and now your brain is wrong and needs to be reprogrammed.
1627200	1631920	Because ultimately, if this doesn't stop, it's gonna come to blows.
1631920	1635280	And I don't mean a street scuffle between a group of anti-fascists
1635280	1637040	and a group of white nationalists,
1637040	1642800	but potentially, you know, well, if this movement doesn't fizzle out by itself,
1642800	1645600	it'll eventually end up being stamped out.
1645600	1649840	And it'd be better to solve all this with words before it comes to that.
1649840	1654240	Because the white nationalists will definitely lose that fight if it happens,
1654240	1655760	just like they did last time.
1655760	1658880	It's an ideology that is destined to lose.
1659600	1661680	So I'll leave you today with a warning
1661680	1664960	for any of my fellow straight white gamer dudes who are listening.
1664960	1673200	It honestly really is in your best interests to stay away from the old fascism there.
1673200	1676240	It never turns out like they say it will, I promise.
1677280	1679440	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1679440	1681520	Let me know what you think in the comments, please.
1681520	1683600	I'd like to hear your feedback on this one.
1683600	1688080	And you can get in touch with me on Twitter or Curious Cat if you want to ask a question.
1688080	1692320	If you liked this video and would like to help me make more videos,
1692320	1694880	consider pledging me a dollar on Patreon.
1694880	1697840	I don't run advertisements on my videos at all,
1697840	1700240	and ideally, I'd like to keep it that way.
1700240	1704240	However, sadly, I do still need to eat.
1704240	1707440	And it turns out they don't let you opt out of paying for food
1707440	1709760	just because you don't like capitalism.
1709760	1712560	If you're broke right now and you can't afford to pledge anything,
1713280	1717760	I also accept payment in the form of photographs of genitals.
1717760	1725040	I'm really kidding.
1725040	1728560	Please do not send me photographs of your genitals.
