0	5360	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about a Prager University video, one titled
5360	12360	Are Fathers Necessary, which features the man himself, Dennis Prager, talking about the importance of fathers.
12360	18720	Since my last video was all about masculinity, and I also talked about my relationship with my own father a bit,
18720	24080	it made me remember this PragerU video about fatherhood that I've always thought was pretty funny.
24080	28800	So in this video, the host, Dennis Prager, who is a religious conservative,
28800	35760	is going to argue for what he sees as the importance of fathers from the perspective of being a religious conservative.
35760	39040	And let's take a look at how Dennis opens his argument.
39040	40000	He says,
40000	47760	For all of recorded history, the need to explain why fathers are necessary would have been regarded as, well, unnecessary.
47760	51920	It would have been like explaining why water or air is necessary.
51920	56000	But we live at a time in which the obvious is routinely denied.
56000	61360	So we see here at the start that Dennis isn't just going to argue for the importance of fathers.
61360	67040	He's going to frame his argument as a pushback against some lefty liberal PC woke narrative
67040	72240	which supposedly denies the obvious reality of the importance of fathers.
72240	76640	And that's a good rhetorical move from Dennis there for a few reasons.
76640	83520	Firstly, framing his argument as a response to an opposing argument simply makes it more interesting to his audience.
83520	90080	It's not just one point of view by itself now, it's multiple battling points of view. How exciting.
90320	97600	Secondly, if Dennis properly establishes that opposing argument and then goes on to demonstrate how his argument is superior,
97600	100160	it makes his own position seem stronger.
100160	106000	And finally, as an experienced conservative political commentator who knows his audience,
106000	114000	Dennis can play into the conservative persecution complex by making them feel under attack by all this PC wokeness around these days.
114000	118960	So a good opening argumentative gambit from Dennis here. Five stars.
118960	123200	Unfortunately though, Dennis is about to make a serious misstep.
123200	130320	You see, instead of simply alluding to the lefty liberal PC woke brigade attacking fatherhood in a general sense,
130320	135040	he attempts to actually evidence the claim with specific examples.
135040	136880	So let's see him try to do that.
148960	178080	So, here we have it.
178080	184640	Three examples of articles in the most prestigious journals denying the importance of fatherhood.
184640	189680	Dennis could have given dozens of examples, he says, but he handpicked these three.
189680	196320	These articles deny the importance of fatherhood and that's what Dennis is going to go on to argue against.
196320	200000	And I'm sure you're all very eager to see what Dennis goes on to say in response.
200000	205200	However, I'm going to deny you that for a moment, try to contain your excitement for a minute,
205200	209120	because first we're going to hit pause right here and examine these articles,
209120	212560	which supposedly deny the importance of fatherhood.
212560	215840	And we'll start with the last of Dennis's examples there.
215840	216560	He says,
220560	222480	So, let's find this article.
223040	226160	If we google for Huffpost and fathers are not needed,
226160	232480	we find this article hosted on the Huffpost Life section of the Huffpost website written by Vincent Daly,
232560	233040	the quote,
237280	241040	And we can notice a few things about this post right off the bat.
241040	244320	Firstly, below the title there, we can see a note which says,
244320	249040	This post was published on the now closed Huffpost contributor platform.
249040	252800	Contributors control their own work and post it freely to our site.
252800	255440	And at the bottom of the piece, we see a note which says,
255440	259120	This post was originally published on cutemonster.com,
259120	263040	which you can follow on Facebook with links to those sites there.
263040	268080	So this piece is someone's personal blog post that was submitted to huffpost.com
268080	270960	via a now-defunct contributor platform.
270960	276320	The next thing we can notice by actually reading the article is that this piece was written by a father
276320	279520	talking about his own experiences of fatherhood.
279520	284640	Becoming a parent can be an overwhelming experience filled with a range of emotions
284640	289600	swinging wildly from sheer joy to deep depression, reads the first line.
289600	295360	And the writer goes on to talk about his own feelings and experiences he had when becoming a parent.
295360	297920	And something else we'll notice if we read this article,
297920	301840	as well as other articles about parenting on cutemonster.com,
301840	305760	is that this particular parenting writer makes a rhetorical distinction
305760	308960	between being a father and being a dad.
308960	311600	In the article on Huffpost, he talks about becoming
311600	314000	not just a father, but a dad.
314000	316720	And he ends the piece by asking other dads,
316720	320160	What's your story? How did you handle being a new father,
320160	323120	as well as the transition to becoming a dad?
323120	326640	For another example from his website, we can read an article titled,
326640	330000	Congratulations baby, you have a brand new dad.
330000	330800	Where he says,
342240	348000	The author is making the distinction between being merely a father in the simple reproductive sense
348000	354640	and being a dad as an identity, a state of being actively engaged in the parenting process.
354640	359600	So, fathers are not needed, what we need are dads.
359600	360480	You get it.
360480	364160	This article isn't saying what Dennis implies it does.
364160	370080	He's misrepresenting this one parenting blogger's father versus dad rhetorical construction
370080	374240	by only relaying the headline and ignoring the actual text.
374240	378880	He's pretending this is some anti-fatherhood article when really it's anything but.
378880	382560	It's actually a piece from a father who writes a parenting blog
382560	385680	where he talks about the many benefits of parenthood.
385680	388800	So, okay, pretty sloppy work from Dennis there,
388800	393680	but that is only one of his three examples after all, that's just one mistake.
393680	398960	Let's not come to any conclusions just yet, maybe he nails the next two, who knows.
398960	401760	So, let's talk about the New York Times article.
401760	402640	Dennis says,
416160	418160	So, this is the next example then.
418160	421840	If we navigate to this discussion on the New York Times website,
421840	424560	we can see the introduction which prompts the question,
424640	427440	What is the purpose of men in modern families?
427440	430320	And we can see the five debaters on the right there.
430880	434720	Now, the first unusual thing you might notice about these five debaters
434720	436720	is that there are actually seven of them.
437360	441360	Dennis said there were five, but there's actually seven, hardy-ha.
441360	446720	Okay, so these debaters are giving their opinions on fatherhood from across the political spectrum,
446720	451440	or at least the truncated New York Times friendly political spectrum anyway.
451440	454720	Conservative religious author Julie Slattery, for example,
454720	459280	argues that a child growing up without a father is a disaster, a tragedy.
459280	462720	Fathers provide unique benefits to children, she says.
462720	469280	A sense of security, a specific male validation, a display of healthy authority in the home.
469280	472400	Author and professor Michelle Weld encounters by saying,
477280	481360	Not all fathers provide security and validation, of course.
481440	484400	Sadly, some fathers are abusive and destructive
484400	487840	and can be a negative influence on their children's development.
487840	492160	This is something important to remember when listening to conservatives like Dennis Prager
492160	495360	talk about the benefits provided by fathers.
495360	498000	For example, later in his video, Dennis will say,
505600	509360	But, do they? Always? In every case?
510000	511200	Of course not.
511200	515520	What Dennis is assuming there is that all these fathers are good fathers,
515520	517600	when obviously they might not be.
517600	522800	He's not speaking to the reality of fathers when he talks about the security they're supposed to provide,
522800	527520	he's talking about his own platonic ideal of what a father should be.
527520	532880	Anyway, the person Dennis decides to quote from this New York Times discussion is Hannah Rosen,
532880	537760	who does indeed open her piece by saying she's not sure whether a child needs a father.
537760	539280	So, here we have it then.
539280	543920	This must be the irrational, modern attack on fatherhood Dennis was concerned about.
543920	549360	But let's indulge ourselves once again and read more than just the first sentence here
549360	553440	and see if this Hannah Rosen character decided to say anything else.
553440	557520	But what I'm pretty sure about is that men need fatherhood.
557520	558240	Uh-oh.
558240	563440	The great tragedy of the last 30 years is how a certain segment of men have fallen off the map.
563440	566960	A series of recessions made it hard for working class men to find work
566960	571440	and they haven't quite adjusted to the new college degree required workforce.
571440	573760	I'm not sure whether a child needs a father,
574320	580720	but fathers deeply need to be good parents and those who can't are left further and further behind.
580720	584560	Now then, this is a pro-fatherhood argument.
584560	589760	Hannah Rosen chose to respond to the question by talking about the benefits of fatherhood
589760	596080	for the fathers involved and chose to frame the difficulties a man might have in providing for a family
596080	601680	in economic terms rather than some vague degradation of traditional morals or whatever.
601680	603520	The prompt for this debate was not,
603520	606160	is having a father good for children?
606160	608240	It was, what are fathers for?
608240	611440	And Hannah Rosen responded to that in a perfectly valid way
611440	615680	by talking about the importance of fatherhood for the fathers.
615680	620640	Dennis has again selectively quoted a pro-fatherhood piece out of context
620640	623120	in order to imply it's anti-fatherhood.
623120	629440	So he's 0 for 2 here on providing evidence of articles which actually deny the importance of fatherhood.
629440	632240	But let's move on and take a look at his third example,
632240	634880	an article in the Atlantic magazine titled
634880	640320	Are Fathers Necessary? A Paternal Contribution May Not Be As Essential As We Think.
640320	643760	And this article makes a fairly simple point which goes as follows.
644400	649360	People often make ominous statistical claims about the lives of children who grow up
649360	651120	without a father in the home.
651120	655120	For example, the article quotes a Father's Day speech by Barack Obama
655120	658240	in which he claimed that kids who grow up without a father
658240	661920	are five times as likely to live in poverty and commit crime,
661920	664400	nine times as likely to drop out of school,
664400	667200	and 20 times as likely to wind up in prison.
667200	669760	However, there's a problem with this framing
669760	674640	if we're attempting to figure out the impact of growing up with or without a father.
674640	679760	And it's that the data used often only compares heterosexual couples raising children
679760	681760	to single mothers raising children.
681760	685440	And for our purposes, that isn't really a fair comparison.
685440	689760	Because the important thing might not be the presence of a father necessarily,
689760	694880	but simply sufficient time, money, and resources to raise children well.
694880	698160	And two people are gonna find that easier than one person alone,
698160	700080	regardless of their genders.
700080	705200	A more fair comparison for the purposes of examining the impact of a father specifically
705200	708560	would be to compare children raised by heterosexual couples
708560	711120	with children raised by lesbian couples.
711120	715280	And if we do that, the increased likelihoods of those negative life outcomes
715280	718720	for children raised without a father disappear.
718720	720400	And this makes sense, right?
720400	722240	It's fairly obvious, isn't it?
722240	727360	Two people are gonna have an easier time raising kids than just one person by themselves.
727360	730800	And I'd hope even Dennis would admit that it would be better for a child
730800	734080	to be raised in a home with two committed and loving mothers
734080	737920	than a home with an uncaring and abusive father, right?
737920	739920	Let's back up and ask a question here.
739920	743040	What is this article doing in Dennis's video?
743040	745440	You see, Dennis himself makes statistical claims
745440	748320	which are similar to the ones discussed in the article.
748320	750080	For instance, he says that, quote,
750080	753840	"...most violent criminals grew up in fatherless homes."
753840	756640	But he's linked under the video to this article,
756640	760160	which contains a clear refutation to his argument.
760160	763760	The data says it's not the gender of the parents that's important,
763840	768400	it's having sufficient time and resources to provide quality parenting.
768400	772480	If anyone in his audience takes the time to actually look at his sources,
772480	777200	they'll see that not only are the three articles he links to not attacking fatherhood,
777200	781600	they actually provide solid counter-arguments to a lot of Dennis's points.
781600	784400	So why show these three articles?
784400	787440	Dennis said he could have given dozens of examples,
787440	790800	so why did he choose these three bad ones?
790800	793520	And the answer is because of the headlines.
794320	798560	If you're looking to build a strawman of anti-fatherhood in the media,
798560	800160	which is what Dennis did,
800160	803360	you can point to these three headlines and lie by omission
803360	805920	about the contents of the articles under them,
805920	812160	trusting your uninquisitive audience to not go and check if what you implied is actually true.
812160	815840	This is how these three articles ended up in this video.
815840	819040	Dennis Prager, or one of his PragerU minions,
819040	821840	went on Google and specifically looked for headlines
821840	824560	they could build a false narrative out of.
824560	828960	We can emulate something close to what they did by going to Google ourselves,
828960	834320	searching for fathers are not needed, the position they wanted to argue against,
834320	838560	and we can see that all three of these articles show up on the first page.
838560	844000	I doubt Dennis has ever read any of these articles himself past what he includes in his video.
844000	849040	Dennis's problem is that the argument he wants to put forward is that fathers are good,
849040	850480	in a general sense.
850480	853120	But he can't just say that by itself.
853120	859680	He needs to frame himself as the underdog conservative pushing back against the PC liberal media.
859680	865600	So he needs to find examples of the PC liberal media arguing that fathers are bad,
865600	867200	in a general sense.
867200	872240	But since he couldn't find anyone actually saying the thing he wants to argue against,
872240	875600	he just cherry-picked some headlines and pretended.
875680	881040	This is why attempting to actually evidence his claim at the start of the video was a mistake.
881040	887040	If he'd just gestured to an anti-fatherhood sentiment held by a nebulous, undefined enemy,
887040	889840	that would be difficult to prove to be false.
889840	892720	But by claiming there's a wealth of available evidence,
892720	896000	and then so obviously failing to provide it,
896000	899200	Dennis has proved his argument false all by himself.
899200	903040	And he can't complain about the articles having misleading headlines,
903040	905520	because he also titles his video,
905520	907120	Are Fathers Necessary?
907120	909200	The same as the Atlantic article.
909200	912880	And this is the last thing I want to point out about this PragerU video.
912880	918640	After posing this question, and acting like the answer to it is the most obvious thing in the world,
918640	923840	Dennis can't actually commit to saying that fathers are absolutely necessary.
923840	928160	Because such a concrete claim would obviously be unreasonable, right?
928160	933920	Children raised without fathers don't crumble to dust or pop out of existence, do they?
933920	936720	Children can be raised without fathers.
936720	939040	As Dennis himself says in his video,
939040	945200	there is no question that many mothers have done an excellent job raising a boy without their son's father.
945200	949520	And he approvingly quotes that same Father's Day speech by Barack Obama,
949520	951840	talking about the importance of fathers.
951840	955040	But Barack Obama was himself raised without a father,
955040	958240	and he went on to become the leader of his country.
958240	960480	So, are fathers necessary?
961360	962000	No.
962000	964560	As Dennis himself admits in his video,
964560	965920	no, they are not.
965920	969680	And this is what I find funny about this particular PragerU video.
969680	975680	Dennis goes to all this effort to craft this disingenuous anti-fatherhood media straw man.
975680	979200	But then by attempting to seem reasonable in comparison to it,
979200	981280	he loses the argument to it.
981280	984640	He ends up saying that fathers aren't necessary.
984640	990080	Dennis Prager saves the funniest undermining of his own argument for the conclusion to his video,
990080	995360	where he says that many people have told him that they see him as a father figure.
995360	1000880	Even a man on the radio like him can fill the role of father for you, he says.
1000880	1005120	And sadly, I'm sure it is probably true that for a lot of dads,
1005120	1008800	what they provide to their children actually can be fully replicated
1008800	1012960	by listening to some old conservative windbag podcaster.
1012960	1015840	But I don't think we can really call that necessary, can we?
1016480	1018640	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1018640	1022080	And thank you especially to all of my supporters on Patreon,
1022080	1024320	some of whom should be scrolling by right now.
1024320	1027200	Patrons get early access to all my videos,
1027200	1032240	continuing access to a few old videos I've taken down for various reasons,
1032240	1035360	and I'm very proud to say that many of my patrons have written to me
1035360	1038800	to tell me they've come to see me as something of a father figure.
1038800	1043360	No, that part isn't true, but the early access to videos part is true, though,
1043360	1045680	so if that sounds like something that would interest you,
1045680	1047680	please check out the Patreon link below.
1048400	1051440	Right, that's all from me today, folks. I'll see you next time.
