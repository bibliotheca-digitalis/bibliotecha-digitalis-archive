00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about a Prager University video, one titled

00:05.360 --> 00:12.360
Are Fathers Necessary, which features the man himself, Dennis Prager, talking about the importance of fathers.

00:12.360 --> 00:18.720
Since my last video was all about masculinity, and I also talked about my relationship with my own father a bit,

00:18.720 --> 00:24.080
it made me remember this PragerU video about fatherhood that I've always thought was pretty funny.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.800
So in this video, the host, Dennis Prager, who is a religious conservative,

00:28.800 --> 00:35.760
is going to argue for what he sees as the importance of fathers from the perspective of being a religious conservative.

00:35.760 --> 00:39.040
And let's take a look at how Dennis opens his argument.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.000
He says,

00:40.000 --> 00:47.760
For all of recorded history, the need to explain why fathers are necessary would have been regarded as, well, unnecessary.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.920
It would have been like explaining why water or air is necessary.

00:51.920 --> 00:56.000
But we live at a time in which the obvious is routinely denied.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.360
So we see here at the start that Dennis isn't just going to argue for the importance of fathers.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.040
He's going to frame his argument as a pushback against some lefty liberal PC woke narrative

01:07.040 --> 01:12.240
which supposedly denies the obvious reality of the importance of fathers.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.640
And that's a good rhetorical move from Dennis there for a few reasons.

01:16.640 --> 01:23.520
Firstly, framing his argument as a response to an opposing argument simply makes it more interesting to his audience.

01:23.520 --> 01:30.080
It's not just one point of view by itself now, it's multiple battling points of view. How exciting.

01:30.320 --> 01:37.600
Secondly, if Dennis properly establishes that opposing argument and then goes on to demonstrate how his argument is superior,

01:37.600 --> 01:40.160
it makes his own position seem stronger.

01:40.160 --> 01:46.000
And finally, as an experienced conservative political commentator who knows his audience,

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
Dennis can play into the conservative persecution complex by making them feel under attack by all this PC wokeness around these days.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.960
So a good opening argumentative gambit from Dennis here. Five stars.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.200
Unfortunately though, Dennis is about to make a serious misstep.

02:03.200 --> 02:10.320
You see, instead of simply alluding to the lefty liberal PC woke brigade attacking fatherhood in a general sense,

02:10.320 --> 02:15.040
he attempts to actually evidence the claim with specific examples.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.880
So let's see him try to do that.

02:28.960 --> 02:58.080
So, here we have it.

02:58.080 --> 03:04.640
Three examples of articles in the most prestigious journals denying the importance of fatherhood.

03:04.640 --> 03:09.680
Dennis could have given dozens of examples, he says, but he handpicked these three.

03:09.680 --> 03:16.320
These articles deny the importance of fatherhood and that's what Dennis is going to go on to argue against.

03:16.320 --> 03:20.000
And I'm sure you're all very eager to see what Dennis goes on to say in response.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.200
However, I'm going to deny you that for a moment, try to contain your excitement for a minute,

03:25.200 --> 03:29.120
because first we're going to hit pause right here and examine these articles,

03:29.120 --> 03:32.560
which supposedly deny the importance of fatherhood.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.840
And we'll start with the last of Dennis's examples there.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.560
He says,

03:40.560 --> 03:42.480
So, let's find this article.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.160
If we google for Huffpost and fathers are not needed,

03:46.160 --> 03:52.480
we find this article hosted on the Huffpost Life section of the Huffpost website written by Vincent Daly,

03:52.560 --> 03:53.040
the quote,

03:57.280 --> 04:01.040
And we can notice a few things about this post right off the bat.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.320
Firstly, below the title there, we can see a note which says,

04:04.320 --> 04:09.040
This post was published on the now closed Huffpost contributor platform.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.800
Contributors control their own work and post it freely to our site.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.440
And at the bottom of the piece, we see a note which says,

04:15.440 --> 04:19.120
This post was originally published on cutemonster.com,

04:19.120 --> 04:23.040
which you can follow on Facebook with links to those sites there.

04:23.040 --> 04:28.080
So this piece is someone's personal blog post that was submitted to huffpost.com

04:28.080 --> 04:30.960
via a now-defunct contributor platform.

04:30.960 --> 04:36.320
The next thing we can notice by actually reading the article is that this piece was written by a father

04:36.320 --> 04:39.520
talking about his own experiences of fatherhood.

04:39.520 --> 04:44.640
Becoming a parent can be an overwhelming experience filled with a range of emotions

04:44.640 --> 04:49.600
swinging wildly from sheer joy to deep depression, reads the first line.

04:49.600 --> 04:55.360
And the writer goes on to talk about his own feelings and experiences he had when becoming a parent.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.920
And something else we'll notice if we read this article,

04:57.920 --> 05:01.840
as well as other articles about parenting on cutemonster.com,

05:01.840 --> 05:05.760
is that this particular parenting writer makes a rhetorical distinction

05:05.760 --> 05:08.960
between being a father and being a dad.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.600
In the article on Huffpost, he talks about becoming

05:11.600 --> 05:14.000
not just a father, but a dad.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.720
And he ends the piece by asking other dads,

05:16.720 --> 05:20.160
What's your story? How did you handle being a new father,

05:20.160 --> 05:23.120
as well as the transition to becoming a dad?

05:23.120 --> 05:26.640
For another example from his website, we can read an article titled,

05:26.640 --> 05:30.000
Congratulations baby, you have a brand new dad.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.800
Where he says,

05:42.240 --> 05:48.000
The author is making the distinction between being merely a father in the simple reproductive sense

05:48.000 --> 05:54.640
and being a dad as an identity, a state of being actively engaged in the parenting process.

05:54.640 --> 05:59.600
So, fathers are not needed, what we need are dads.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.480
You get it.

06:00.480 --> 06:04.160
This article isn't saying what Dennis implies it does.

06:04.160 --> 06:10.080
He's misrepresenting this one parenting blogger's father versus dad rhetorical construction

06:10.080 --> 06:14.240
by only relaying the headline and ignoring the actual text.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.880
He's pretending this is some anti-fatherhood article when really it's anything but.

06:18.880 --> 06:22.560
It's actually a piece from a father who writes a parenting blog

06:22.560 --> 06:25.680
where he talks about the many benefits of parenthood.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.800
So, okay, pretty sloppy work from Dennis there,

06:28.800 --> 06:33.680
but that is only one of his three examples after all, that's just one mistake.

06:33.680 --> 06:38.960
Let's not come to any conclusions just yet, maybe he nails the next two, who knows.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.760
So, let's talk about the New York Times article.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.640
Dennis says,

06:56.160 --> 06:58.160
So, this is the next example then.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.840
If we navigate to this discussion on the New York Times website,

07:01.840 --> 07:04.560
we can see the introduction which prompts the question,

07:04.640 --> 07:07.440
What is the purpose of men in modern families?

07:07.440 --> 07:10.320
And we can see the five debaters on the right there.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.720
Now, the first unusual thing you might notice about these five debaters

07:14.720 --> 07:16.720
is that there are actually seven of them.

07:17.360 --> 07:21.360
Dennis said there were five, but there's actually seven, hardy-ha.

07:21.360 --> 07:26.720
Okay, so these debaters are giving their opinions on fatherhood from across the political spectrum,

07:26.720 --> 07:31.440
or at least the truncated New York Times friendly political spectrum anyway.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.720
Conservative religious author Julie Slattery, for example,

07:34.720 --> 07:39.280
argues that a child growing up without a father is a disaster, a tragedy.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.720
Fathers provide unique benefits to children, she says.

07:42.720 --> 07:49.280
A sense of security, a specific male validation, a display of healthy authority in the home.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.400
Author and professor Michelle Weld encounters by saying,

07:57.280 --> 08:01.360
Not all fathers provide security and validation, of course.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.400
Sadly, some fathers are abusive and destructive

08:04.400 --> 08:07.840
and can be a negative influence on their children's development.

08:07.840 --> 08:12.160
This is something important to remember when listening to conservatives like Dennis Prager

08:12.160 --> 08:15.360
talk about the benefits provided by fathers.

08:15.360 --> 08:18.000
For example, later in his video, Dennis will say,

08:25.600 --> 08:29.360
But, do they? Always? In every case?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.200
Of course not.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.520
What Dennis is assuming there is that all these fathers are good fathers,

08:35.520 --> 08:37.600
when obviously they might not be.

08:37.600 --> 08:42.800
He's not speaking to the reality of fathers when he talks about the security they're supposed to provide,

08:42.800 --> 08:47.520
he's talking about his own platonic ideal of what a father should be.

08:47.520 --> 08:52.880
Anyway, the person Dennis decides to quote from this New York Times discussion is Hannah Rosen,

08:52.880 --> 08:57.760
who does indeed open her piece by saying she's not sure whether a child needs a father.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.280
So, here we have it then.

08:59.280 --> 09:03.920
This must be the irrational, modern attack on fatherhood Dennis was concerned about.

09:03.920 --> 09:09.360
But let's indulge ourselves once again and read more than just the first sentence here

09:09.360 --> 09:13.440
and see if this Hannah Rosen character decided to say anything else.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.520
But what I'm pretty sure about is that men need fatherhood.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.240
Uh-oh.

09:18.240 --> 09:23.440
The great tragedy of the last 30 years is how a certain segment of men have fallen off the map.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.960
A series of recessions made it hard for working class men to find work

09:26.960 --> 09:31.440
and they haven't quite adjusted to the new college degree required workforce.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.760
I'm not sure whether a child needs a father,

09:34.320 --> 09:40.720
but fathers deeply need to be good parents and those who can't are left further and further behind.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.560
Now then, this is a pro-fatherhood argument.

09:44.560 --> 09:49.760
Hannah Rosen chose to respond to the question by talking about the benefits of fatherhood

09:49.760 --> 09:56.080
for the fathers involved and chose to frame the difficulties a man might have in providing for a family

09:56.080 --> 10:01.680
in economic terms rather than some vague degradation of traditional morals or whatever.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.520
The prompt for this debate was not,

10:03.520 --> 10:06.160
is having a father good for children?

10:06.160 --> 10:08.240
It was, what are fathers for?

10:08.240 --> 10:11.440
And Hannah Rosen responded to that in a perfectly valid way

10:11.440 --> 10:15.680
by talking about the importance of fatherhood for the fathers.

10:15.680 --> 10:20.640
Dennis has again selectively quoted a pro-fatherhood piece out of context

10:20.640 --> 10:23.120
in order to imply it's anti-fatherhood.

10:23.120 --> 10:29.440
So he's 0 for 2 here on providing evidence of articles which actually deny the importance of fatherhood.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.240
But let's move on and take a look at his third example,

10:32.240 --> 10:34.880
an article in the Atlantic magazine titled

10:34.880 --> 10:40.320
Are Fathers Necessary? A Paternal Contribution May Not Be As Essential As We Think.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.760
And this article makes a fairly simple point which goes as follows.

10:44.400 --> 10:49.360
People often make ominous statistical claims about the lives of children who grow up

10:49.360 --> 10:51.120
without a father in the home.

10:51.120 --> 10:55.120
For example, the article quotes a Father's Day speech by Barack Obama

10:55.120 --> 10:58.240
in which he claimed that kids who grow up without a father

10:58.240 --> 11:01.920
are five times as likely to live in poverty and commit crime,

11:01.920 --> 11:04.400
nine times as likely to drop out of school,

11:04.400 --> 11:07.200
and 20 times as likely to wind up in prison.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.760
However, there's a problem with this framing

11:09.760 --> 11:14.640
if we're attempting to figure out the impact of growing up with or without a father.

11:14.640 --> 11:19.760
And it's that the data used often only compares heterosexual couples raising children

11:19.760 --> 11:21.760
to single mothers raising children.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.440
And for our purposes, that isn't really a fair comparison.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.760
Because the important thing might not be the presence of a father necessarily,

11:29.760 --> 11:34.880
but simply sufficient time, money, and resources to raise children well.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.160
And two people are gonna find that easier than one person alone,

11:38.160 --> 11:40.080
regardless of their genders.

11:40.080 --> 11:45.200
A more fair comparison for the purposes of examining the impact of a father specifically

11:45.200 --> 11:48.560
would be to compare children raised by heterosexual couples

11:48.560 --> 11:51.120
with children raised by lesbian couples.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.280
And if we do that, the increased likelihoods of those negative life outcomes

11:55.280 --> 11:58.720
for children raised without a father disappear.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.400
And this makes sense, right?

12:00.400 --> 12:02.240
It's fairly obvious, isn't it?

12:02.240 --> 12:07.360
Two people are gonna have an easier time raising kids than just one person by themselves.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.800
And I'd hope even Dennis would admit that it would be better for a child

12:10.800 --> 12:14.080
to be raised in a home with two committed and loving mothers

12:14.080 --> 12:17.920
than a home with an uncaring and abusive father, right?

12:17.920 --> 12:19.920
Let's back up and ask a question here.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.040
What is this article doing in Dennis's video?

12:23.040 --> 12:25.440
You see, Dennis himself makes statistical claims

12:25.440 --> 12:28.320
which are similar to the ones discussed in the article.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.080
For instance, he says that, quote,

12:30.080 --> 12:33.840
"...most violent criminals grew up in fatherless homes."

12:33.840 --> 12:36.640
But he's linked under the video to this article,

12:36.640 --> 12:40.160
which contains a clear refutation to his argument.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.760
The data says it's not the gender of the parents that's important,

12:43.840 --> 12:48.400
it's having sufficient time and resources to provide quality parenting.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.480
If anyone in his audience takes the time to actually look at his sources,

12:52.480 --> 12:57.200
they'll see that not only are the three articles he links to not attacking fatherhood,

12:57.200 --> 13:01.600
they actually provide solid counter-arguments to a lot of Dennis's points.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.400
So why show these three articles?

13:04.400 --> 13:07.440
Dennis said he could have given dozens of examples,

13:07.440 --> 13:10.800
so why did he choose these three bad ones?

13:10.800 --> 13:13.520
And the answer is because of the headlines.

13:14.320 --> 13:18.560
If you're looking to build a strawman of anti-fatherhood in the media,

13:18.560 --> 13:20.160
which is what Dennis did,

13:20.160 --> 13:23.360
you can point to these three headlines and lie by omission

13:23.360 --> 13:25.920
about the contents of the articles under them,

13:25.920 --> 13:32.160
trusting your uninquisitive audience to not go and check if what you implied is actually true.

13:32.160 --> 13:35.840
This is how these three articles ended up in this video.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.040
Dennis Prager, or one of his PragerU minions,

13:39.040 --> 13:41.840
went on Google and specifically looked for headlines

13:41.840 --> 13:44.560
they could build a false narrative out of.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.960
We can emulate something close to what they did by going to Google ourselves,

13:48.960 --> 13:54.320
searching for fathers are not needed, the position they wanted to argue against,

13:54.320 --> 13:58.560
and we can see that all three of these articles show up on the first page.

13:58.560 --> 14:04.000
I doubt Dennis has ever read any of these articles himself past what he includes in his video.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.040
Dennis's problem is that the argument he wants to put forward is that fathers are good,

14:09.040 --> 14:10.480
in a general sense.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.120
But he can't just say that by itself.

14:13.120 --> 14:19.680
He needs to frame himself as the underdog conservative pushing back against the PC liberal media.

14:19.680 --> 14:25.600
So he needs to find examples of the PC liberal media arguing that fathers are bad,

14:25.600 --> 14:27.200
in a general sense.

14:27.200 --> 14:32.240
But since he couldn't find anyone actually saying the thing he wants to argue against,

14:32.240 --> 14:35.600
he just cherry-picked some headlines and pretended.

14:35.680 --> 14:41.040
This is why attempting to actually evidence his claim at the start of the video was a mistake.

14:41.040 --> 14:47.040
If he'd just gestured to an anti-fatherhood sentiment held by a nebulous, undefined enemy,

14:47.040 --> 14:49.840
that would be difficult to prove to be false.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.720
But by claiming there's a wealth of available evidence,

14:52.720 --> 14:56.000
and then so obviously failing to provide it,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.200
Dennis has proved his argument false all by himself.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.040
And he can't complain about the articles having misleading headlines,

15:03.040 --> 15:05.520
because he also titles his video,

15:05.520 --> 15:07.120
Are Fathers Necessary?

15:07.120 --> 15:09.200
The same as the Atlantic article.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.880
And this is the last thing I want to point out about this PragerU video.

15:12.880 --> 15:18.640
After posing this question, and acting like the answer to it is the most obvious thing in the world,

15:18.640 --> 15:23.840
Dennis can't actually commit to saying that fathers are absolutely necessary.

15:23.840 --> 15:28.160
Because such a concrete claim would obviously be unreasonable, right?

15:28.160 --> 15:33.920
Children raised without fathers don't crumble to dust or pop out of existence, do they?

15:33.920 --> 15:36.720
Children can be raised without fathers.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.040
As Dennis himself says in his video,

15:39.040 --> 15:45.200
there is no question that many mothers have done an excellent job raising a boy without their son's father.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.520
And he approvingly quotes that same Father's Day speech by Barack Obama,

15:49.520 --> 15:51.840
talking about the importance of fathers.

15:51.840 --> 15:55.040
But Barack Obama was himself raised without a father,

15:55.040 --> 15:58.240
and he went on to become the leader of his country.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.480
So, are fathers necessary?

16:01.360 --> 16:02.000
No.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.560
As Dennis himself admits in his video,

16:04.560 --> 16:05.920
no, they are not.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.680
And this is what I find funny about this particular PragerU video.

16:09.680 --> 16:15.680
Dennis goes to all this effort to craft this disingenuous anti-fatherhood media straw man.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.200
But then by attempting to seem reasonable in comparison to it,

16:19.200 --> 16:21.280
he loses the argument to it.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.640
He ends up saying that fathers aren't necessary.

16:24.640 --> 16:30.080
Dennis Prager saves the funniest undermining of his own argument for the conclusion to his video,

16:30.080 --> 16:35.360
where he says that many people have told him that they see him as a father figure.

16:35.360 --> 16:40.880
Even a man on the radio like him can fill the role of father for you, he says.

16:40.880 --> 16:45.120
And sadly, I'm sure it is probably true that for a lot of dads,

16:45.120 --> 16:48.800
what they provide to their children actually can be fully replicated

16:48.800 --> 16:52.960
by listening to some old conservative windbag podcaster.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.840
But I don't think we can really call that necessary, can we?

16:56.480 --> 16:58.640
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.080
And thank you especially to all of my supporters on Patreon,

17:02.080 --> 17:04.320
some of whom should be scrolling by right now.

17:04.320 --> 17:07.200
Patrons get early access to all my videos,

17:07.200 --> 17:12.240
continuing access to a few old videos I've taken down for various reasons,

17:12.240 --> 17:15.360
and I'm very proud to say that many of my patrons have written to me

17:15.360 --> 17:18.800
to tell me they've come to see me as something of a father figure.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.360
No, that part isn't true, but the early access to videos part is true, though,

17:23.360 --> 17:25.680
so if that sounds like something that would interest you,

17:25.680 --> 17:27.680
please check out the Patreon link below.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.440
Right, that's all from me today, folks. I'll see you next time.
