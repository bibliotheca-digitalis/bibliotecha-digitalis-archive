00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about a Prager University video, one titled

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Are Fathers Necessary, which features the man himself, Dennis Prager, talking about the importance of fathers.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,720
Since my last video was all about masculinity, and I also talked about my relationship with my own father a bit,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,080
it made me remember this PragerU video about fatherhood that I've always thought was pretty funny.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,800
So in this video, the host, Dennis Prager, who is a religious conservative,

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,760
is going to argue for what he sees as the importance of fathers from the perspective of being a religious conservative.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
And let's take a look at how Dennis opens his argument.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,000
He says,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,760
For all of recorded history, the need to explain why fathers are necessary would have been regarded as, well, unnecessary.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,920
It would have been like explaining why water or air is necessary.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,000
But we live at a time in which the obvious is routinely denied.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,360
So we see here at the start that Dennis isn't just going to argue for the importance of fathers.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,040
He's going to frame his argument as a pushback against some lefty liberal PC woke narrative

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,240
which supposedly denies the obvious reality of the importance of fathers.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,640
And that's a good rhetorical move from Dennis there for a few reasons.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,520
Firstly, framing his argument as a response to an opposing argument simply makes it more interesting to his audience.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,080
It's not just one point of view by itself now, it's multiple battling points of view. How exciting.

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,600
Secondly, if Dennis properly establishes that opposing argument and then goes on to demonstrate how his argument is superior,

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,160
it makes his own position seem stronger.

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,000
And finally, as an experienced conservative political commentator who knows his audience,

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Dennis can play into the conservative persecution complex by making them feel under attack by all this PC wokeness around these days.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,960
So a good opening argumentative gambit from Dennis here. Five stars.

23
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,200
Unfortunately though, Dennis is about to make a serious misstep.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,320
You see, instead of simply alluding to the lefty liberal PC woke brigade attacking fatherhood in a general sense,

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,040
he attempts to actually evidence the claim with specific examples.

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,880
So let's see him try to do that.

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:58,080
So, here we have it.

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,640
Three examples of articles in the most prestigious journals denying the importance of fatherhood.

29
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,680
Dennis could have given dozens of examples, he says, but he handpicked these three.

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,320
These articles deny the importance of fatherhood and that's what Dennis is going to go on to argue against.

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,000
And I'm sure you're all very eager to see what Dennis goes on to say in response.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,200
However, I'm going to deny you that for a moment, try to contain your excitement for a minute,

33
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,120
because first we're going to hit pause right here and examine these articles,

34
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560
which supposedly deny the importance of fatherhood.

35
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
And we'll start with the last of Dennis's examples there.

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,560
He says,

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
So, let's find this article.

38
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,160
If we google for Huffpost and fathers are not needed,

39
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,480
we find this article hosted on the Huffpost Life section of the Huffpost website written by Vincent Daly,

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,040
the quote,

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,040
And we can notice a few things about this post right off the bat.

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,320
Firstly, below the title there, we can see a note which says,

43
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,040
This post was published on the now closed Huffpost contributor platform.

44
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,800
Contributors control their own work and post it freely to our site.

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,440
And at the bottom of the piece, we see a note which says,

46
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,120
This post was originally published on cutemonster.com,

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,040
which you can follow on Facebook with links to those sites there.

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,080
So this piece is someone's personal blog post that was submitted to huffpost.com

49
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,960
via a now-defunct contributor platform.

50
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,320
The next thing we can notice by actually reading the article is that this piece was written by a father

51
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,520
talking about his own experiences of fatherhood.

52
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,640
Becoming a parent can be an overwhelming experience filled with a range of emotions

53
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,600
swinging wildly from sheer joy to deep depression, reads the first line.

54
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,360
And the writer goes on to talk about his own feelings and experiences he had when becoming a parent.

55
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,920
And something else we'll notice if we read this article,

56
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,840
as well as other articles about parenting on cutemonster.com,

57
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,760
is that this particular parenting writer makes a rhetorical distinction

58
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,960
between being a father and being a dad.

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,600
In the article on Huffpost, he talks about becoming

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
not just a father, but a dad.

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,720
And he ends the piece by asking other dads,

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,160
What's your story? How did you handle being a new father,

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,120
as well as the transition to becoming a dad?

64
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,640
For another example from his website, we can read an article titled,

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,000
Congratulations baby, you have a brand new dad.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,800
Where he says,

67
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,000
The author is making the distinction between being merely a father in the simple reproductive sense

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,640
and being a dad as an identity, a state of being actively engaged in the parenting process.

69
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,600
So, fathers are not needed, what we need are dads.

70
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,480
You get it.

71
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,160
This article isn't saying what Dennis implies it does.

72
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,080
He's misrepresenting this one parenting blogger's father versus dad rhetorical construction

73
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,240
by only relaying the headline and ignoring the actual text.

74
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,880
He's pretending this is some anti-fatherhood article when really it's anything but.

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,560
It's actually a piece from a father who writes a parenting blog

76
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,680
where he talks about the many benefits of parenthood.

77
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,800
So, okay, pretty sloppy work from Dennis there,

78
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,680
but that is only one of his three examples after all, that's just one mistake.

79
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,960
Let's not come to any conclusions just yet, maybe he nails the next two, who knows.

80
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,760
So, let's talk about the New York Times article.

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,640
Dennis says,

82
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
So, this is the next example then.

83
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,840
If we navigate to this discussion on the New York Times website,

84
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,560
we can see the introduction which prompts the question,

85
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,440
What is the purpose of men in modern families?

86
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,320
And we can see the five debaters on the right there.

87
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,720
Now, the first unusual thing you might notice about these five debaters

88
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
is that there are actually seven of them.

89
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Dennis said there were five, but there's actually seven, hardy-ha.

90
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,720
Okay, so these debaters are giving their opinions on fatherhood from across the political spectrum,

91
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,440
or at least the truncated New York Times friendly political spectrum anyway.

92
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,720
Conservative religious author Julie Slattery, for example,

93
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,280
argues that a child growing up without a father is a disaster, a tragedy.

94
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,720
Fathers provide unique benefits to children, she says.

95
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,280
A sense of security, a specific male validation, a display of healthy authority in the home.

96
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
Author and professor Michelle Weld encounters by saying,

97
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,360
Not all fathers provide security and validation, of course.

98
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,400
Sadly, some fathers are abusive and destructive

99
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,840
and can be a negative influence on their children's development.

100
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,160
This is something important to remember when listening to conservatives like Dennis Prager

101
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
talk about the benefits provided by fathers.

102
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
For example, later in his video, Dennis will say,

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,360
But, do they? Always? In every case?

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Of course not.

105
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,520
What Dennis is assuming there is that all these fathers are good fathers,

106
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,600
when obviously they might not be.

107
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,800
He's not speaking to the reality of fathers when he talks about the security they're supposed to provide,

108
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,520
he's talking about his own platonic ideal of what a father should be.

109
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,880
Anyway, the person Dennis decides to quote from this New York Times discussion is Hannah Rosen,

110
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
who does indeed open her piece by saying she's not sure whether a child needs a father.

111
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,280
So, here we have it then.

112
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,920
This must be the irrational, modern attack on fatherhood Dennis was concerned about.

113
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,360
But let's indulge ourselves once again and read more than just the first sentence here

114
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
and see if this Hannah Rosen character decided to say anything else.

115
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,520
But what I'm pretty sure about is that men need fatherhood.

116
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,240
Uh-oh.

117
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,440
The great tragedy of the last 30 years is how a certain segment of men have fallen off the map.

118
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,960
A series of recessions made it hard for working class men to find work

119
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,440
and they haven't quite adjusted to the new college degree required workforce.

120
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,760
I'm not sure whether a child needs a father,

121
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,720
but fathers deeply need to be good parents and those who can't are left further and further behind.

122
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,560
Now then, this is a pro-fatherhood argument.

123
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,760
Hannah Rosen chose to respond to the question by talking about the benefits of fatherhood

124
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,080
for the fathers involved and chose to frame the difficulties a man might have in providing for a family

125
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,680
in economic terms rather than some vague degradation of traditional morals or whatever.

126
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,520
The prompt for this debate was not,

127
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,160
is having a father good for children?

128
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
It was, what are fathers for?

129
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,440
And Hannah Rosen responded to that in a perfectly valid way

130
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,680
by talking about the importance of fatherhood for the fathers.

131
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,640
Dennis has again selectively quoted a pro-fatherhood piece out of context

132
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
in order to imply it's anti-fatherhood.

133
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,440
So he's 0 for 2 here on providing evidence of articles which actually deny the importance of fatherhood.

134
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,240
But let's move on and take a look at his third example,

135
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,880
an article in the Atlantic magazine titled

136
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,320
Are Fathers Necessary? A Paternal Contribution May Not Be As Essential As We Think.

137
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,760
And this article makes a fairly simple point which goes as follows.

138
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,360
People often make ominous statistical claims about the lives of children who grow up

139
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,120
without a father in the home.

140
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,120
For example, the article quotes a Father's Day speech by Barack Obama

141
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,240
in which he claimed that kids who grow up without a father

142
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,920
are five times as likely to live in poverty and commit crime,

143
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,400
nine times as likely to drop out of school,

144
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,200
and 20 times as likely to wind up in prison.

145
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,760
However, there's a problem with this framing

146
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,640
if we're attempting to figure out the impact of growing up with or without a father.

147
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,760
And it's that the data used often only compares heterosexual couples raising children

148
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
to single mothers raising children.

149
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,440
And for our purposes, that isn't really a fair comparison.

150
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,760
Because the important thing might not be the presence of a father necessarily,

151
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,880
but simply sufficient time, money, and resources to raise children well.

152
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,160
And two people are gonna find that easier than one person alone,

153
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,080
regardless of their genders.

154
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,200
A more fair comparison for the purposes of examining the impact of a father specifically

155
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,560
would be to compare children raised by heterosexual couples

156
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,120
with children raised by lesbian couples.

157
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,280
And if we do that, the increased likelihoods of those negative life outcomes

158
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,720
for children raised without a father disappear.

159
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,400
And this makes sense, right?

160
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,240
It's fairly obvious, isn't it?

161
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,360
Two people are gonna have an easier time raising kids than just one person by themselves.

162
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
And I'd hope even Dennis would admit that it would be better for a child

163
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,080
to be raised in a home with two committed and loving mothers

164
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,920
than a home with an uncaring and abusive father, right?

165
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Let's back up and ask a question here.

166
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
What is this article doing in Dennis's video?

167
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,440
You see, Dennis himself makes statistical claims

168
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
which are similar to the ones discussed in the article.

169
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,080
For instance, he says that, quote,

170
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,840
"...most violent criminals grew up in fatherless homes."

171
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,640
But he's linked under the video to this article,

172
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,160
which contains a clear refutation to his argument.

173
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
The data says it's not the gender of the parents that's important,

174
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,400
it's having sufficient time and resources to provide quality parenting.

175
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,480
If anyone in his audience takes the time to actually look at his sources,

176
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,200
they'll see that not only are the three articles he links to not attacking fatherhood,

177
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,600
they actually provide solid counter-arguments to a lot of Dennis's points.

178
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,400
So why show these three articles?

179
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,440
Dennis said he could have given dozens of examples,

180
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,800
so why did he choose these three bad ones?

181
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,520
And the answer is because of the headlines.

182
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,560
If you're looking to build a strawman of anti-fatherhood in the media,

183
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
which is what Dennis did,

184
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,360
you can point to these three headlines and lie by omission

185
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920
about the contents of the articles under them,

186
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,160
trusting your uninquisitive audience to not go and check if what you implied is actually true.

187
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,840
This is how these three articles ended up in this video.

188
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,040
Dennis Prager, or one of his PragerU minions,

189
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,840
went on Google and specifically looked for headlines

190
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,560
they could build a false narrative out of.

191
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,960
We can emulate something close to what they did by going to Google ourselves,

192
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,320
searching for fathers are not needed, the position they wanted to argue against,

193
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,560
and we can see that all three of these articles show up on the first page.

194
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,000
I doubt Dennis has ever read any of these articles himself past what he includes in his video.

195
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,040
Dennis's problem is that the argument he wants to put forward is that fathers are good,

196
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,480
in a general sense.

197
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,120
But he can't just say that by itself.

198
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,680
He needs to frame himself as the underdog conservative pushing back against the PC liberal media.

199
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,600
So he needs to find examples of the PC liberal media arguing that fathers are bad,

200
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,200
in a general sense.

201
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,240
But since he couldn't find anyone actually saying the thing he wants to argue against,

202
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
he just cherry-picked some headlines and pretended.

203
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,040
This is why attempting to actually evidence his claim at the start of the video was a mistake.

204
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,040
If he'd just gestured to an anti-fatherhood sentiment held by a nebulous, undefined enemy,

205
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,840
that would be difficult to prove to be false.

206
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,720
But by claiming there's a wealth of available evidence,

207
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,000
and then so obviously failing to provide it,

208
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,200
Dennis has proved his argument false all by himself.

209
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,040
And he can't complain about the articles having misleading headlines,

210
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,520
because he also titles his video,

211
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,120
Are Fathers Necessary?

212
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,200
The same as the Atlantic article.

213
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,880
And this is the last thing I want to point out about this PragerU video.

214
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,640
After posing this question, and acting like the answer to it is the most obvious thing in the world,

215
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,840
Dennis can't actually commit to saying that fathers are absolutely necessary.

216
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,160
Because such a concrete claim would obviously be unreasonable, right?

217
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,920
Children raised without fathers don't crumble to dust or pop out of existence, do they?

218
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,720
Children can be raised without fathers.

219
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,040
As Dennis himself says in his video,

220
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,200
there is no question that many mothers have done an excellent job raising a boy without their son's father.

221
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,520
And he approvingly quotes that same Father's Day speech by Barack Obama,

222
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,840
talking about the importance of fathers.

223
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,040
But Barack Obama was himself raised without a father,

224
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
and he went on to become the leader of his country.

225
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,480
So, are fathers necessary?

226
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,000
No.

227
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,560
As Dennis himself admits in his video,

228
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
no, they are not.

229
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
And this is what I find funny about this particular PragerU video.

230
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Dennis goes to all this effort to craft this disingenuous anti-fatherhood media straw man.

231
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,200
But then by attempting to seem reasonable in comparison to it,

232
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,280
he loses the argument to it.

233
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,640
He ends up saying that fathers aren't necessary.

234
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,080
Dennis Prager saves the funniest undermining of his own argument for the conclusion to his video,

235
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,360
where he says that many people have told him that they see him as a father figure.

236
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,880
Even a man on the radio like him can fill the role of father for you, he says.

237
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,120
And sadly, I'm sure it is probably true that for a lot of dads,

238
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,800
what they provide to their children actually can be fully replicated

239
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,960
by listening to some old conservative windbag podcaster.

240
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,840
But I don't think we can really call that necessary, can we?

241
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,640
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

242
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,080
And thank you especially to all of my supporters on Patreon,

243
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,320
some of whom should be scrolling by right now.

244
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,200
Patrons get early access to all my videos,

245
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,240
continuing access to a few old videos I've taken down for various reasons,

246
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,360
and I'm very proud to say that many of my patrons have written to me

247
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,800
to tell me they've come to see me as something of a father figure.

248
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,360
No, that part isn't true, but the early access to videos part is true, though,

249
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,680
so if that sounds like something that would interest you,

250
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
please check out the Patreon link below.

251
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
