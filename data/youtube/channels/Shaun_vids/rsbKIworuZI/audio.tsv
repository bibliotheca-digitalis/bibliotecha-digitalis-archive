0	7160	So, enormous Blizzard fanboy that I am, I've been playing their massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft,
7160	11200	on and off, since its vanilla release in 2004?
12000	13400	2004.
14000	16900	Oh my god. What a waste of a life.
17200	21500	And like a lot of the playerbase, I was hugely disappointed with Warlords of Draenor,
21500	25100	the latest, and by far the worst, expansion to the game.
25700	31400	Draenor got off to a rocky start with server problems for a good part of its first week of release,
31400	36700	and the developers totally unprepared for the volume of players trying to access the new content.
37200	41300	Now it turns out that funneling thousands of players into the same location,
41300	46900	and having them all try to interact with the same object at the same time, causes server problems.
46900	49500	But hey, who could have seen that coming?
49900	55300	And for me, at least, that first week really set the tone for the rest of the expansion.
55300	57200	I liked a few things about it.
57200	62900	The leveling experience was very well designed, and the music, as always, is top-notch.
62900	67400	But overall, I got the feeling that Blizzard was kind of phoning this one in.
67400	74300	And so, with the next expansion on the horizon, and Warlords of Draenor finally and mercifully breathing its last,
74300	77700	I'm going to complain about it for roughly ten minutes.
80500	87300	Now, the biggest and most glaring problem with Draenor is the lack of content compared to previous expansions.
87300	90000	There just wasn't enough to do at max level.
90000	93900	If we compare it to Mists of Pandaria, the previous expansion,
93900	97800	that launched with a new class, a new race, and a new starting zone,
97800	102000	and now Draenor launched with no new classes, races, or starting zones.
102000	106800	Pandaria was released with three raids, and added two more for a total of five.
106800	111400	Draenor was released with two, and added just one more for a total of three.
111400	115400	Now, if we look at the first major patches, in Pandaria's Patch 5.1,
115400	120400	they revamped the Crasserang Wild Zone, and they added new quest hubs, new faction reputations,
120400	126900	five new scenarios, and the Brawler's Guild, as well as lots of other little quality of life improvements.
126900	134200	In Draenor's first content patch, they added a music box which plays songs when you click on it,
134200	139800	and a camera that you can take selfies with, and that's about it.
139800	145100	I mean, what you're looking at here is basically all the new content they added in 6.1.
146500	151800	Oh, I'm sorry, actually. They also added Twitter integration, so by simply typing "/share",
151800	159200	you can show all of your Twitter followers all the fun you're having with your new music box and selfie camera.
159300	164300	Now, after the initial patch, Draenor only added one new zone and one new raid.
164300	169900	In Pandaria, comparatively anyway, they were adding new things all the time, raids and zones,
169900	176900	and new islands and quest hubs, and PvP things for all those crazy people who try to play Warcraft PvP.
176900	180500	Now, I could tell something was up with Draenor before it was released,
180500	184500	when Blizzard announced that they were changing Draenor's faction capitals.
184600	188400	Now, originally, the Alliance was supposed to be located in Karabor,
188400	191200	and the Horde capital was in Bladespire Citadel.
191200	193400	I thought this was a really good idea,
193400	198600	setting the capitals in important locations that feature prominently in the story.
198600	204000	But then Blizzard announced they were changing the hubs to generic human and orc settlements on Ashran,
204000	207200	the PvP island that everybody hates.
207200	210100	When I saw Ashran, however, I said,
210100	212500	Oh, this isn't... so bad.
212500	219200	It's all under construction, and then Blizzard will obviously patch it over time, and it'll get more complete,
219200	222300	and you'll get to watch it progress into a full settlement.
222300	223500	Uh, but, no.
224500	226100	It still looks like this.
226500	231400	Unfinished, underdeveloped, and never to be fully fleshed out.
235400	237400	So let's talk about the garrison.
237400	243000	Now, the garrison is Draenor's flagship feature, and it's where players spent the majority of their time.
243000	247200	When garrisons were first announced, they were going to be highly customizable.
247200	250800	You could use architecture from all the game's different races.
250800	254000	They were also going to be flexible in terms of location,
254000	258000	with players able to pick the zone in which they wanted to set up their garrison.
258000	260000	Now, as launch date got closer, though,
260000	265600	this was scaled back to one generic orc or human aesthetic in a fixed location,
265600	270000	and this was really disappointing, and it made the garrisons feel a lot less unique.
270000	274200	Now, when I first heard about the garrisons, I thought they'd be guild garrisons,
274200	279600	because, after all, Warcraft is a multiplayer game, and it's meant to be played with other people.
279600	284800	But instead, the developers took the route of instancing each person in their own garrison,
284800	287200	where they never encounter other players.
287200	292400	This was a big mistake for reasons which should have been obvious prior to development.
292400	297600	Now, as far as actual gameplay in the garrison, again, there just isn't enough to do.
297600	302000	Players saw everything the garrison had to offer very early into the expansion,
302000	307400	and after that, garrison activities offered no real sense of progression or reward.
307400	312400	This wasn't helped by the inclusion of the shipyard, which was a totally redundant feature,
312400	315600	nothing more than a reskin of the garrison follower missions,
315600	320200	with the added feature that now your ships can be destroyed and you lose all your progress.
320200	321400	It's like Blizzard said,
321400	326600	hey, you know that really boring garrison follower mechanic that everyone's sick of by now?
326600	329000	Well, look, we made it even worse.
329400	330400	Enjoy!
334600	341400	Now, my personal dislike for Draenor mainly stems from the story, which is absolutely dreadful.
341400	345000	And now you might say, Warcraft has never really been about the story,
345000	351000	it's generally just an amalgamation of fantasy and adventure elements stolen from better stories.
351000	355400	And you'd be right to say that, Warcraft's writing has never really been that good.
355400	360400	There's some cool stories here and there, but on the whole, Blizzard's writing is fairly average.
360400	363800	That is, until Draenor, which is just awful.
363800	369000	It's a mess of retconning and plot holes and poorly conveyed ideas.
369000	372600	Blizzard's announcement that the expansion was gonna feature time travel
372600	376200	naturally led to a lot of confused questions from the player base.
376200	381000	You know, were we changing the past? Does changing the past affect the present?
381000	384400	What about characters that existed in the past and are still alive,
384400	387600	like Velen and Garrosh and Vindicator Morad?
387600	391000	Are there two of all of them now? You know, what's going on?
391400	396800	In response, Blizzard, who was seemingly taken completely by surprise by these questions,
396800	399400	announced that not only was Draenor set in the past,
399400	403000	it was also taking place in an alternate dimension.
403000	407800	And I thought, well, oh brilliant, time travel and alternate dimensions.
407800	409400	Well, that's just great.
409400	414800	This plot hole combination totally robbed all the story beats of any real weight.
414800	418400	For example, when Velen sacrifices himself for the greater good,
418400	420800	the player character is just standing around like,
420800	423200	yeah, well, we have a spare Velen.
423200	427600	And if he dies, I guess we can just grab another Velen from one of the alternate dimensions
427600	429600	that apparently exist now.
429600	433600	And what about the idea that the orcs don't drink the demon blood?
433600	436000	I really hated this change.
436000	441800	The original story is a nice little inversion of the typical orc fantasy tropes.
441800	447000	You know, initially, the humans think the orcs are savage, bloodthirsty monsters,
447000	450600	but really, they're just being used as pawns by the real evil,
450600	455400	and when they're free of the corruption, the orcs are spiritual and shamanistic people,
455400	458200	and they just want to make a home for themselves.
458200	463600	Warlords of Draenor completely ruins this idea by having the orcs act exactly the same,
463600	466200	regardless of whether they drink the demon blood or not.
466200	470800	They're still trying to invade Azeroth, even when they're not being forced to do it.
470800	474800	This is frankly a bizarre change which accomplishes nothing in the story,
474800	479400	except making the original demonic corruption element seem completely pointless.
479400	483400	Not least because in 6.2, they end up drinking the demon blood anyway,
483400	487400	so what was the point of having them not drink it in the first place?
487400	493200	The other issue with the Iron Horde is that the player base had just played a year of Siege of Orgrimmar,
493200	498200	and that raid was full of orcs, orcs, and more orcs.
498200	501600	And then Warlords of Draenor comes out, and Blizzard says,
501600	504800	right, who's ready for some more orcs?
504800	509200	And we were like, well, actually, Blizzard, we were ready for literally anything else.
509200	512800	So let's talk about the Iron Horde's invasion of Azeroth,
512800	518600	that lasts all of 15 minutes before they're kicked back through the portal in total defeat.
518600	521200	This is another issue with Draenor's story.
521200	526200	The titular Warlords of Draenor, they never seem like a real threat.
526200	531600	They spent all that time and effort building the Dark Portal, and it gets destroyed in about half an hour.
531600	535400	And after that, the threat they pose to Azeroth kind of disappears.
535400	538000	And I don't care about the threat they pose to Draenor,
538000	543000	because this is time travel alternate dimension Draenor, it's not our Draenor.
543000	548000	Really, with regards to actual Azeroth, the only thing that changes in the whole expansion
548000	550200	is that Gul'dan comes back to life.
550200	554000	Blizzard could have released one of those little animated comics on their website
554000	557400	showing Sargeras or someone resurrecting Gul'dan,
557400	560600	and we could have skipped Warlords of Draenor entirely.
560600	565000	The final point I want to make is about the player character's role in the story,
565000	570400	and now this is just my opinion, but I don't want my character to be a garrison commander
570400	573800	or a leader of the Alliance or Horde forces.
573800	578800	It unnecessarily imposes a role on the player in a game where that sort of thing
578800	581200	should be left to the player's imagination.
581200	583800	Now, I can guess at Blizzard's reasoning for this.
583800	589400	Maybe they wanted to show the player characters being honored for their past accomplishments or something,
589400	594000	but its effect is to ruin the player character's arc within the expansion.
594000	600600	If we look back at past expansions, players typically start out in a relatively lowly and humble place.
600600	604800	For example, in Burning Crusade, you're just another soldier going through the portal.
604800	610000	In Wrath of the Lich King, the best expansion, when Alliance players get off the ship in Northrend,
610000	613200	they're greeted with a recruitment line for the expedition.
613200	617000	And in Cataclysm, the recruitment soldier for the Vashia Zone
617000	620800	simply refers to you as citizen and asks for your help on the mission.
620800	624800	The player character might be granted a little more respect than the ordinary soldiers,
624800	628600	but overall, there's a sense you start out as just another recruit.
628600	633200	And then over the course of the expansion, your character's reputation grows.
633200	636800	And then in the final raid against whatever the primary antagonist is,
636800	640000	the NPCs treat your character like a great hero.
640400	643200	The flow of darkness abates.
643200	647000	It seems you truly are the heroes of legend.
647000	654000	Draenor upends this simple story arc by starting your character out with a big victory over the Iron Horde,
654000	655800	the destruction of the Dark Portal,
655800	661200	and then it immediately casts you as the commander of the Alliance or Horde forces on Draenor.
661200	664400	And from there, there's nowhere for your character to go.
664400	668800	And maybe it's just me, but I think that certain characters and story elements
668800	671600	should be kept out of the player's reach somewhat.
671600	677200	I mean, I don't want big lore characters like Muradin Bronzebeard, for instance,
677200	680800	turning up in my garrison like an ordinary quest giver.
680800	683800	It makes them seem pedestrian and boring
683800	687600	when we should have a sense of reverence for their status and position.
687600	692200	I will say, though, Blizzard, if you are dead set on having the player character
692200	697200	be some sort of big Horde or Alliance commander who's important to the story,
697200	700800	don't then get scared and start taking control away from them
700800	704200	when it comes to important story moments like, for instance,
704200	708000	the quest where it looks like you're going to get to kill Garrosh
708000	711000	and then they take control away from you at the end and say,
711000	717400	oh, sorry, actually, we needed you to lose that fight so that Thrall can fight against Garrosh instead.
717400	719000	You can't have it both ways.
719000	723800	Either let us participate in the story as a big, important lore character
723800	730000	or have us in the background as one of the nameless adventurers who assists the major lore characters.
730000	732800	Trying to do it both ways pleases no one.
735800	739600	So what advice would we give to Blizzard going forward into Legion
739600	742800	to help them avoid the mistakes they made in Warlords of Draenor?
742800	748600	Well, personally, I'd say take out all of the bad things that were in Warlords of Draenor
748600	750800	and just replace them with good things.
750800	758800	So more good things, fewer bad things, and bring scenarios back. I like those.
