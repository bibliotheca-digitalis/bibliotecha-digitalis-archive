1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
So, enormous Blizzard fanboy that I am, I've been playing their massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft,

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,200
on and off, since its vanilla release in 2004?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,400
2004.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,900
Oh my god. What a waste of a life.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,500
And like a lot of the playerbase, I was hugely disappointed with Warlords of Draenor,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,100
the latest, and by far the worst, expansion to the game.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,400
Draenor got off to a rocky start with server problems for a good part of its first week of release,

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,700
and the developers totally unprepared for the volume of players trying to access the new content.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,300
Now it turns out that funneling thousands of players into the same location,

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,900
and having them all try to interact with the same object at the same time, causes server problems.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,500
But hey, who could have seen that coming?

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,300
And for me, at least, that first week really set the tone for the rest of the expansion.

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,200
I liked a few things about it.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,900
The leveling experience was very well designed, and the music, as always, is top-notch.

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,400
But overall, I got the feeling that Blizzard was kind of phoning this one in.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,300
And so, with the next expansion on the horizon, and Warlords of Draenor finally and mercifully breathing its last,

17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,700
I'm going to complain about it for roughly ten minutes.

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,300
Now, the biggest and most glaring problem with Draenor is the lack of content compared to previous expansions.

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,000
There just wasn't enough to do at max level.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,900
If we compare it to Mists of Pandaria, the previous expansion,

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,800
that launched with a new class, a new race, and a new starting zone,

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,000
and now Draenor launched with no new classes, races, or starting zones.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,800
Pandaria was released with three raids, and added two more for a total of five.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,400
Draenor was released with two, and added just one more for a total of three.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Now, if we look at the first major patches, in Pandaria's Patch 5.1,

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,400
they revamped the Crasserang Wild Zone, and they added new quest hubs, new faction reputations,

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,900
five new scenarios, and the Brawler's Guild, as well as lots of other little quality of life improvements.

28
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,200
In Draenor's first content patch, they added a music box which plays songs when you click on it,

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,800
and a camera that you can take selfies with, and that's about it.

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,100
I mean, what you're looking at here is basically all the new content they added in 6.1.

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,800
Oh, I'm sorry, actually. They also added Twitter integration, so by simply typing "/share",

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,200
you can show all of your Twitter followers all the fun you're having with your new music box and selfie camera.

33
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Now, after the initial patch, Draenor only added one new zone and one new raid.

34
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,900
In Pandaria, comparatively anyway, they were adding new things all the time, raids and zones,

35
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,900
and new islands and quest hubs, and PvP things for all those crazy people who try to play Warcraft PvP.

36
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,500
Now, I could tell something was up with Draenor before it was released,

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
when Blizzard announced that they were changing Draenor's faction capitals.

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,400
Now, originally, the Alliance was supposed to be located in Karabor,

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
and the Horde capital was in Bladespire Citadel.

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
I thought this was a really good idea,

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,600
setting the capitals in important locations that feature prominently in the story.

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,000
But then Blizzard announced they were changing the hubs to generic human and orc settlements on Ashran,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,200
the PvP island that everybody hates.

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,100
When I saw Ashran, however, I said,

45
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,500
Oh, this isn't... so bad.

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:39,200
It's all under construction, and then Blizzard will obviously patch it over time, and it'll get more complete,

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,300
and you'll get to watch it progress into a full settlement.

48
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,500
Uh, but, no.

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,100
It still looks like this.

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,400
Unfinished, underdeveloped, and never to be fully fleshed out.

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
So let's talk about the garrison.

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,000
Now, the garrison is Draenor's flagship feature, and it's where players spent the majority of their time.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,200
When garrisons were first announced, they were going to be highly customizable.

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,800
You could use architecture from all the game's different races.

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,000
They were also going to be flexible in terms of location,

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
with players able to pick the zone in which they wanted to set up their garrison.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Now, as launch date got closer, though,

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,600
this was scaled back to one generic orc or human aesthetic in a fixed location,

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
and this was really disappointing, and it made the garrisons feel a lot less unique.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,200
Now, when I first heard about the garrisons, I thought they'd be guild garrisons,

61
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,600
because, after all, Warcraft is a multiplayer game, and it's meant to be played with other people.

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,800
But instead, the developers took the route of instancing each person in their own garrison,

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,200
where they never encounter other players.

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,400
This was a big mistake for reasons which should have been obvious prior to development.

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,600
Now, as far as actual gameplay in the garrison, again, there just isn't enough to do.

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
Players saw everything the garrison had to offer very early into the expansion,

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,400
and after that, garrison activities offered no real sense of progression or reward.

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,400
This wasn't helped by the inclusion of the shipyard, which was a totally redundant feature,

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,600
nothing more than a reskin of the garrison follower missions,

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,200
with the added feature that now your ships can be destroyed and you lose all your progress.

71
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
It's like Blizzard said,

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,600
hey, you know that really boring garrison follower mechanic that everyone's sick of by now?

73
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, look, we made it even worse.

74
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Enjoy!

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Now, my personal dislike for Draenor mainly stems from the story, which is absolutely dreadful.

76
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,000
And now you might say, Warcraft has never really been about the story,

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
it's generally just an amalgamation of fantasy and adventure elements stolen from better stories.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,400
And you'd be right to say that, Warcraft's writing has never really been that good.

79
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,400
There's some cool stories here and there, but on the whole, Blizzard's writing is fairly average.

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,800
That is, until Draenor, which is just awful.

81
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a mess of retconning and plot holes and poorly conveyed ideas.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Blizzard's announcement that the expansion was gonna feature time travel

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,200
naturally led to a lot of confused questions from the player base.

84
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,000
You know, were we changing the past? Does changing the past affect the present?

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,400
What about characters that existed in the past and are still alive,

86
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
like Velen and Garrosh and Vindicator Morad?

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,000
Are there two of all of them now? You know, what's going on?

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,800
In response, Blizzard, who was seemingly taken completely by surprise by these questions,

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
announced that not only was Draenor set in the past,

90
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,000
it was also taking place in an alternate dimension.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,800
And I thought, well, oh brilliant, time travel and alternate dimensions.

92
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Well, that's just great.

93
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,800
This plot hole combination totally robbed all the story beats of any real weight.

94
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,400
For example, when Velen sacrifices himself for the greater good,

95
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
the player character is just standing around like,

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,200
yeah, well, we have a spare Velen.

97
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,600
And if he dies, I guess we can just grab another Velen from one of the alternate dimensions

98
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
that apparently exist now.

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,600
And what about the idea that the orcs don't drink the demon blood?

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
I really hated this change.

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,800
The original story is a nice little inversion of the typical orc fantasy tropes.

102
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,000
You know, initially, the humans think the orcs are savage, bloodthirsty monsters,

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,600
but really, they're just being used as pawns by the real evil,

104
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,400
and when they're free of the corruption, the orcs are spiritual and shamanistic people,

105
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,200
and they just want to make a home for themselves.

106
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,600
Warlords of Draenor completely ruins this idea by having the orcs act exactly the same,

107
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,200
regardless of whether they drink the demon blood or not.

108
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,800
They're still trying to invade Azeroth, even when they're not being forced to do it.

109
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
This is frankly a bizarre change which accomplishes nothing in the story,

110
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,400
except making the original demonic corruption element seem completely pointless.

111
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Not least because in 6.2, they end up drinking the demon blood anyway,

112
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,400
so what was the point of having them not drink it in the first place?

113
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,200
The other issue with the Iron Horde is that the player base had just played a year of Siege of Orgrimmar,

114
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,200
and that raid was full of orcs, orcs, and more orcs.

115
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,600
And then Warlords of Draenor comes out, and Blizzard says,

116
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,800
right, who's ready for some more orcs?

117
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,200
And we were like, well, actually, Blizzard, we were ready for literally anything else.

118
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,800
So let's talk about the Iron Horde's invasion of Azeroth,

119
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,600
that lasts all of 15 minutes before they're kicked back through the portal in total defeat.

120
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,200
This is another issue with Draenor's story.

121
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,200
The titular Warlords of Draenor, they never seem like a real threat.

122
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,600
They spent all that time and effort building the Dark Portal, and it gets destroyed in about half an hour.

123
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,400
And after that, the threat they pose to Azeroth kind of disappears.

124
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,000
And I don't care about the threat they pose to Draenor,

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
because this is time travel alternate dimension Draenor, it's not our Draenor.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Really, with regards to actual Azeroth, the only thing that changes in the whole expansion

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
is that Gul'dan comes back to life.

128
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,000
Blizzard could have released one of those little animated comics on their website

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,400
showing Sargeras or someone resurrecting Gul'dan,

130
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,600
and we could have skipped Warlords of Draenor entirely.

131
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,000
The final point I want to make is about the player character's role in the story,

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,400
and now this is just my opinion, but I don't want my character to be a garrison commander

133
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,800
or a leader of the Alliance or Horde forces.

134
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,800
It unnecessarily imposes a role on the player in a game where that sort of thing

135
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,200
should be left to the player's imagination.

136
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,800
Now, I can guess at Blizzard's reasoning for this.

137
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,400
Maybe they wanted to show the player characters being honored for their past accomplishments or something,

138
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,000
but its effect is to ruin the player character's arc within the expansion.

139
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,600
If we look back at past expansions, players typically start out in a relatively lowly and humble place.

140
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,800
For example, in Burning Crusade, you're just another soldier going through the portal.

141
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,000
In Wrath of the Lich King, the best expansion, when Alliance players get off the ship in Northrend,

142
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
they're greeted with a recruitment line for the expedition.

143
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,000
And in Cataclysm, the recruitment soldier for the Vashia Zone

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,800
simply refers to you as citizen and asks for your help on the mission.

145
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
The player character might be granted a little more respect than the ordinary soldiers,

146
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,600
but overall, there's a sense you start out as just another recruit.

147
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,200
And then over the course of the expansion, your character's reputation grows.

148
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,800
And then in the final raid against whatever the primary antagonist is,

149
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
the NPCs treat your character like a great hero.

150
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,200
The flow of darkness abates.

151
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,000
It seems you truly are the heroes of legend.

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Draenor upends this simple story arc by starting your character out with a big victory over the Iron Horde,

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
the destruction of the Dark Portal,

154
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,200
and then it immediately casts you as the commander of the Alliance or Horde forces on Draenor.

155
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,400
And from there, there's nowhere for your character to go.

156
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,800
And maybe it's just me, but I think that certain characters and story elements

157
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
should be kept out of the player's reach somewhat.

158
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,200
I mean, I don't want big lore characters like Muradin Bronzebeard, for instance,

159
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
turning up in my garrison like an ordinary quest giver.

160
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,800
It makes them seem pedestrian and boring

161
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,600
when we should have a sense of reverence for their status and position.

162
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,200
I will say, though, Blizzard, if you are dead set on having the player character

163
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,200
be some sort of big Horde or Alliance commander who's important to the story,

164
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,800
don't then get scared and start taking control away from them

165
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,200
when it comes to important story moments like, for instance,

166
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,000
the quest where it looks like you're going to get to kill Garrosh

167
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and then they take control away from you at the end and say,

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,400
oh, sorry, actually, we needed you to lose that fight so that Thrall can fight against Garrosh instead.

169
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
You can't have it both ways.

170
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,800
Either let us participate in the story as a big, important lore character

171
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,000
or have us in the background as one of the nameless adventurers who assists the major lore characters.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
Trying to do it both ways pleases no one.

173
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,600
So what advice would we give to Blizzard going forward into Legion

174
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,800
to help them avoid the mistakes they made in Warlords of Draenor?

175
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,600
Well, personally, I'd say take out all of the bad things that were in Warlords of Draenor

176
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,800
and just replace them with good things.

177
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,800
So more good things, fewer bad things, and bring scenarios back. I like those.
