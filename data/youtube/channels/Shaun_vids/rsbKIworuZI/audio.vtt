00:00.000 --> 00:07.160
So, enormous Blizzard fanboy that I am, I've been playing their massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft,

00:07.160 --> 00:11.200
on and off, since its vanilla release in 2004?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.400
2004.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.900
Oh my god. What a waste of a life.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.500
And like a lot of the playerbase, I was hugely disappointed with Warlords of Draenor,

00:21.500 --> 00:25.100
the latest, and by far the worst, expansion to the game.

00:25.700 --> 00:31.400
Draenor got off to a rocky start with server problems for a good part of its first week of release,

00:31.400 --> 00:36.700
and the developers totally unprepared for the volume of players trying to access the new content.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.300
Now it turns out that funneling thousands of players into the same location,

00:41.300 --> 00:46.900
and having them all try to interact with the same object at the same time, causes server problems.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.500
But hey, who could have seen that coming?

00:49.900 --> 00:55.300
And for me, at least, that first week really set the tone for the rest of the expansion.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.200
I liked a few things about it.

00:57.200 --> 01:02.900
The leveling experience was very well designed, and the music, as always, is top-notch.

01:02.900 --> 01:07.400
But overall, I got the feeling that Blizzard was kind of phoning this one in.

01:07.400 --> 01:14.300
And so, with the next expansion on the horizon, and Warlords of Draenor finally and mercifully breathing its last,

01:14.300 --> 01:17.700
I'm going to complain about it for roughly ten minutes.

01:20.500 --> 01:27.300
Now, the biggest and most glaring problem with Draenor is the lack of content compared to previous expansions.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.000
There just wasn't enough to do at max level.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.900
If we compare it to Mists of Pandaria, the previous expansion,

01:33.900 --> 01:37.800
that launched with a new class, a new race, and a new starting zone,

01:37.800 --> 01:42.000
and now Draenor launched with no new classes, races, or starting zones.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.800
Pandaria was released with three raids, and added two more for a total of five.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.400
Draenor was released with two, and added just one more for a total of three.

01:51.400 --> 01:55.400
Now, if we look at the first major patches, in Pandaria's Patch 5.1,

01:55.400 --> 02:00.400
they revamped the Crasserang Wild Zone, and they added new quest hubs, new faction reputations,

02:00.400 --> 02:06.900
five new scenarios, and the Brawler's Guild, as well as lots of other little quality of life improvements.

02:06.900 --> 02:14.200
In Draenor's first content patch, they added a music box which plays songs when you click on it,

02:14.200 --> 02:19.800
and a camera that you can take selfies with, and that's about it.

02:19.800 --> 02:25.100
I mean, what you're looking at here is basically all the new content they added in 6.1.

02:26.500 --> 02:31.800
Oh, I'm sorry, actually. They also added Twitter integration, so by simply typing "/share",

02:31.800 --> 02:39.200
you can show all of your Twitter followers all the fun you're having with your new music box and selfie camera.

02:39.300 --> 02:44.300
Now, after the initial patch, Draenor only added one new zone and one new raid.

02:44.300 --> 02:49.900
In Pandaria, comparatively anyway, they were adding new things all the time, raids and zones,

02:49.900 --> 02:56.900
and new islands and quest hubs, and PvP things for all those crazy people who try to play Warcraft PvP.

02:56.900 --> 03:00.500
Now, I could tell something was up with Draenor before it was released,

03:00.500 --> 03:04.500
when Blizzard announced that they were changing Draenor's faction capitals.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.400
Now, originally, the Alliance was supposed to be located in Karabor,

03:08.400 --> 03:11.200
and the Horde capital was in Bladespire Citadel.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.400
I thought this was a really good idea,

03:13.400 --> 03:18.600
setting the capitals in important locations that feature prominently in the story.

03:18.600 --> 03:24.000
But then Blizzard announced they were changing the hubs to generic human and orc settlements on Ashran,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.200
the PvP island that everybody hates.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.100
When I saw Ashran, however, I said,

03:30.100 --> 03:32.500
Oh, this isn't... so bad.

03:32.500 --> 03:39.200
It's all under construction, and then Blizzard will obviously patch it over time, and it'll get more complete,

03:39.200 --> 03:42.300
and you'll get to watch it progress into a full settlement.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.500
Uh, but, no.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.100
It still looks like this.

03:46.500 --> 03:51.400
Unfinished, underdeveloped, and never to be fully fleshed out.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.400
So let's talk about the garrison.

03:57.400 --> 04:03.000
Now, the garrison is Draenor's flagship feature, and it's where players spent the majority of their time.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.200
When garrisons were first announced, they were going to be highly customizable.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.800
You could use architecture from all the game's different races.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.000
They were also going to be flexible in terms of location,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
with players able to pick the zone in which they wanted to set up their garrison.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, as launch date got closer, though,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.600
this was scaled back to one generic orc or human aesthetic in a fixed location,

04:25.600 --> 04:30.000
and this was really disappointing, and it made the garrisons feel a lot less unique.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.200
Now, when I first heard about the garrisons, I thought they'd be guild garrisons,

04:34.200 --> 04:39.600
because, after all, Warcraft is a multiplayer game, and it's meant to be played with other people.

04:39.600 --> 04:44.800
But instead, the developers took the route of instancing each person in their own garrison,

04:44.800 --> 04:47.200
where they never encounter other players.

04:47.200 --> 04:52.400
This was a big mistake for reasons which should have been obvious prior to development.

04:52.400 --> 04:57.600
Now, as far as actual gameplay in the garrison, again, there just isn't enough to do.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.000
Players saw everything the garrison had to offer very early into the expansion,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.400
and after that, garrison activities offered no real sense of progression or reward.

05:07.400 --> 05:12.400
This wasn't helped by the inclusion of the shipyard, which was a totally redundant feature,

05:12.400 --> 05:15.600
nothing more than a reskin of the garrison follower missions,

05:15.600 --> 05:20.200
with the added feature that now your ships can be destroyed and you lose all your progress.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.400
It's like Blizzard said,

05:21.400 --> 05:26.600
hey, you know that really boring garrison follower mechanic that everyone's sick of by now?

05:26.600 --> 05:29.000
Well, look, we made it even worse.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.400
Enjoy!

05:34.600 --> 05:41.400
Now, my personal dislike for Draenor mainly stems from the story, which is absolutely dreadful.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.000
And now you might say, Warcraft has never really been about the story,

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
it's generally just an amalgamation of fantasy and adventure elements stolen from better stories.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.400
And you'd be right to say that, Warcraft's writing has never really been that good.

05:55.400 --> 06:00.400
There's some cool stories here and there, but on the whole, Blizzard's writing is fairly average.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.800
That is, until Draenor, which is just awful.

06:03.800 --> 06:09.000
It's a mess of retconning and plot holes and poorly conveyed ideas.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.600
Blizzard's announcement that the expansion was gonna feature time travel

06:12.600 --> 06:16.200
naturally led to a lot of confused questions from the player base.

06:16.200 --> 06:21.000
You know, were we changing the past? Does changing the past affect the present?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.400
What about characters that existed in the past and are still alive,

06:24.400 --> 06:27.600
like Velen and Garrosh and Vindicator Morad?

06:27.600 --> 06:31.000
Are there two of all of them now? You know, what's going on?

06:31.400 --> 06:36.800
In response, Blizzard, who was seemingly taken completely by surprise by these questions,

06:36.800 --> 06:39.400
announced that not only was Draenor set in the past,

06:39.400 --> 06:43.000
it was also taking place in an alternate dimension.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.800
And I thought, well, oh brilliant, time travel and alternate dimensions.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.400
Well, that's just great.

06:49.400 --> 06:54.800
This plot hole combination totally robbed all the story beats of any real weight.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.400
For example, when Velen sacrifices himself for the greater good,

06:58.400 --> 07:00.800
the player character is just standing around like,

07:00.800 --> 07:03.200
yeah, well, we have a spare Velen.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.600
And if he dies, I guess we can just grab another Velen from one of the alternate dimensions

07:07.600 --> 07:09.600
that apparently exist now.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.600
And what about the idea that the orcs don't drink the demon blood?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.000
I really hated this change.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.800
The original story is a nice little inversion of the typical orc fantasy tropes.

07:21.800 --> 07:27.000
You know, initially, the humans think the orcs are savage, bloodthirsty monsters,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.600
but really, they're just being used as pawns by the real evil,

07:30.600 --> 07:35.400
and when they're free of the corruption, the orcs are spiritual and shamanistic people,

07:35.400 --> 07:38.200
and they just want to make a home for themselves.

07:38.200 --> 07:43.600
Warlords of Draenor completely ruins this idea by having the orcs act exactly the same,

07:43.600 --> 07:46.200
regardless of whether they drink the demon blood or not.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.800
They're still trying to invade Azeroth, even when they're not being forced to do it.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.800
This is frankly a bizarre change which accomplishes nothing in the story,

07:54.800 --> 07:59.400
except making the original demonic corruption element seem completely pointless.

07:59.400 --> 08:03.400
Not least because in 6.2, they end up drinking the demon blood anyway,

08:03.400 --> 08:07.400
so what was the point of having them not drink it in the first place?

08:07.400 --> 08:13.200
The other issue with the Iron Horde is that the player base had just played a year of Siege of Orgrimmar,

08:13.200 --> 08:18.200
and that raid was full of orcs, orcs, and more orcs.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.600
And then Warlords of Draenor comes out, and Blizzard says,

08:21.600 --> 08:24.800
right, who's ready for some more orcs?

08:24.800 --> 08:29.200
And we were like, well, actually, Blizzard, we were ready for literally anything else.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.800
So let's talk about the Iron Horde's invasion of Azeroth,

08:32.800 --> 08:38.600
that lasts all of 15 minutes before they're kicked back through the portal in total defeat.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.200
This is another issue with Draenor's story.

08:41.200 --> 08:46.200
The titular Warlords of Draenor, they never seem like a real threat.

08:46.200 --> 08:51.600
They spent all that time and effort building the Dark Portal, and it gets destroyed in about half an hour.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.400
And after that, the threat they pose to Azeroth kind of disappears.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.000
And I don't care about the threat they pose to Draenor,

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
because this is time travel alternate dimension Draenor, it's not our Draenor.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
Really, with regards to actual Azeroth, the only thing that changes in the whole expansion

09:08.000 --> 09:10.200
is that Gul'dan comes back to life.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.000
Blizzard could have released one of those little animated comics on their website

09:14.000 --> 09:17.400
showing Sargeras or someone resurrecting Gul'dan,

09:17.400 --> 09:20.600
and we could have skipped Warlords of Draenor entirely.

09:20.600 --> 09:25.000
The final point I want to make is about the player character's role in the story,

09:25.000 --> 09:30.400
and now this is just my opinion, but I don't want my character to be a garrison commander

09:30.400 --> 09:33.800
or a leader of the Alliance or Horde forces.

09:33.800 --> 09:38.800
It unnecessarily imposes a role on the player in a game where that sort of thing

09:38.800 --> 09:41.200
should be left to the player's imagination.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.800
Now, I can guess at Blizzard's reasoning for this.

09:43.800 --> 09:49.400
Maybe they wanted to show the player characters being honored for their past accomplishments or something,

09:49.400 --> 09:54.000
but its effect is to ruin the player character's arc within the expansion.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.600
If we look back at past expansions, players typically start out in a relatively lowly and humble place.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.800
For example, in Burning Crusade, you're just another soldier going through the portal.

10:04.800 --> 10:10.000
In Wrath of the Lich King, the best expansion, when Alliance players get off the ship in Northrend,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.200
they're greeted with a recruitment line for the expedition.

10:13.200 --> 10:17.000
And in Cataclysm, the recruitment soldier for the Vashia Zone

10:17.000 --> 10:20.800
simply refers to you as citizen and asks for your help on the mission.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.800
The player character might be granted a little more respect than the ordinary soldiers,

10:24.800 --> 10:28.600
but overall, there's a sense you start out as just another recruit.

10:28.600 --> 10:33.200
And then over the course of the expansion, your character's reputation grows.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.800
And then in the final raid against whatever the primary antagonist is,

10:36.800 --> 10:40.000
the NPCs treat your character like a great hero.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.200
The flow of darkness abates.

10:43.200 --> 10:47.000
It seems you truly are the heroes of legend.

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
Draenor upends this simple story arc by starting your character out with a big victory over the Iron Horde,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.800
the destruction of the Dark Portal,

10:55.800 --> 11:01.200
and then it immediately casts you as the commander of the Alliance or Horde forces on Draenor.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.400
And from there, there's nowhere for your character to go.

11:04.400 --> 11:08.800
And maybe it's just me, but I think that certain characters and story elements

11:08.800 --> 11:11.600
should be kept out of the player's reach somewhat.

11:11.600 --> 11:17.200
I mean, I don't want big lore characters like Muradin Bronzebeard, for instance,

11:17.200 --> 11:20.800
turning up in my garrison like an ordinary quest giver.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.800
It makes them seem pedestrian and boring

11:23.800 --> 11:27.600
when we should have a sense of reverence for their status and position.

11:27.600 --> 11:32.200
I will say, though, Blizzard, if you are dead set on having the player character

11:32.200 --> 11:37.200
be some sort of big Horde or Alliance commander who's important to the story,

11:37.200 --> 11:40.800
don't then get scared and start taking control away from them

11:40.800 --> 11:44.200
when it comes to important story moments like, for instance,

11:44.200 --> 11:48.000
the quest where it looks like you're going to get to kill Garrosh

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
and then they take control away from you at the end and say,

11:51.000 --> 11:57.400
oh, sorry, actually, we needed you to lose that fight so that Thrall can fight against Garrosh instead.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.000
You can't have it both ways.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.800
Either let us participate in the story as a big, important lore character

12:03.800 --> 12:10.000
or have us in the background as one of the nameless adventurers who assists the major lore characters.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.800
Trying to do it both ways pleases no one.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.600
So what advice would we give to Blizzard going forward into Legion

12:19.600 --> 12:22.800
to help them avoid the mistakes they made in Warlords of Draenor?

12:22.800 --> 12:28.600
Well, personally, I'd say take out all of the bad things that were in Warlords of Draenor

12:28.600 --> 12:30.800
and just replace them with good things.

12:30.800 --> 12:38.800
So more good things, fewer bad things, and bring scenarios back. I like those.
