0	7600	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about Black Panther, the latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe of movies
7600	11000	featuring heroes with superhuman abilities.
11000	14900	But first of all, we need to talk about A Christmas Carol.
14900	19800	So, the main character in A Christmas Carol is, of course, Ebenezer Scrooge.
19800	26200	And I'll show here a picture of Michael Caine in The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is by far the best adaptation.
26200	30500	And I'd like you to be a bit of a guinea pig in a little experiment of mine right now.
30500	34800	How would you describe the character of Ebenezer Scrooge?
35400	38200	Now, this might seem silly, but it does have a point.
39100	40600	So, what is Scrooge like?
40600	46800	Well, he's selfish, he's miserly, he's cold-hearted, unpleasant.
47300	48700	You know, you get the picture.
49100	54300	Hard and sharp as a flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.
54300	58300	Secret and self-contained and solitary as an oyster.
59100	60900	So, my question is this.
60900	64000	Why is this the image of Scrooge that persists?
64500	68500	Because, of course, this is only Scrooge's character at the start of the narrative.
69100	72900	But then, you know, things happen to him and he changes.
73300	80900	A Christmas Carol is the story of how Scrooge transforms from a cold, cruel person into a generous, kind person.
81300	84900	Yet, we understand that if someone calls another person Scrooge,
84900	90900	they're saying they're unkind and mean, rather than as good a man as the good old city knew,
90900	93900	as Dickens describes Scrooge by the end of the story.
94500	95500	So, why is this?
96300	97300	Well, I don't know.
97300	99100	You know, it's just something I noticed.
99100	102300	And maybe it's just that first impressions count a lot.
102900	108700	You know, maybe the most memorable characters and places and things in a story just more naturally occur at the start,
108700	114700	before the narrative has a chance to smooth out the edges on its way to bringing the story to a resolution.
115100	119700	Scrooge certainly stands out more at the start of the book than at the end.
120100	125500	So, anyway, let's seemingly abandon this point here and move on to talk about Black Panther.
125500	128700	And fair warning, there will be spoilers in this video.
128700	132500	Not just for Black Panther, but for for Ragnarok as well.
133100	136100	And, well, a Christmas carol, too, I guess.
136100	137500	It's a bit late for that now, though.
138100	141500	So, why will there be spoilers for for Ragnarok in this video?
141900	146700	Well, that's because both it and Black Panther follow a very similar story structure,
146700	148900	which I'll just outline rather quickly here.
149300	153300	So, the main character of the story is a prince who is the heir to a kingdom.
153500	156100	His father is the king, and in the mind of the prince,
156100	159900	he's a great leader who the prince does not yet feel ready to replace.
160300	162100	However, following the death of the king,
162100	166300	the prince finds out a terrible secret about something his father did in the past,
166300	169900	something that creates the antagonizing force in the movie.
170100	175900	In Thor, Odin imprisoned his firstborn child, Hela, after she helped him conquer the Nine Realms.
176100	180900	And in Black Panther, King T'Chaka killed his own brother and abandons his nephew,
181100	184300	who returns later, like Hela, seeking revenge.
184700	187500	The prince is initially defeated and depowered.
187700	192300	Thor loses his hammer, T'Challa loses his... cat powers.
192700	197500	And this sets them up to later return, regain their powers, defeat the antagonist,
197500	199700	and prevent them from doing something terrible.
200100	204700	And in the process, the prince decides he will have to radically transform his society.
205100	208900	Thor intentionally destroys Asgard in order to defeat Hela,
209100	211500	and T'Challa, at the conclusion of the movie,
211700	214700	reveals the existence of Wakanda to the rest of the world.
215100	217300	So we're here to talk about Black Panther.
217300	220900	So why am I mentioning its similarity to Thor Ragnarok?
220900	226300	You know, am I really trying to show off that I noticed two Marvel superhero movies were similar?
227100	227900	Well, a little bit.
228500	230700	But it does tie into a point I want to make later.
231100	234700	So, I've teed up two different points at the start of the video here.
234700	237900	The Scrooge thing and the Thor Ragnarok thing.
237900	240300	And let's leave them both dangling there awkwardly
240300	244700	and move on to answer today's apparently pressing question.
245100	248300	Is Wakanda an alt-right ethnostate?
248700	252700	Wakanda is the alt-right's paradise.
253100	255900	And every single inhabitant of Wakanda,
256100	260100	with the exception of T'Challa's sister, is alt-right.
260100	267700	Wakanda is actually almost identical to the very stereotype of what you say Trump is trying to create in America.
267700	268900	Wakanda is homogenous.
268900	270500	Wakanda is isolationist.
270500	273500	Wakanda is willing to exploit its natural resources.
273500	276100	Wakanda is protected by walls.
276100	278300	Wakanda doesn't allow immigration.
278300	281300	Wakanda is based around national self-interest.
281300	284700	That's literally everything you say Trump is bad for doing.
284700	288700	But when fictional black people are doing it, suddenly it's amazing.
289100	293500	Wakanda is a xenophobic, high-tech, space-age ethnostate
293700	296500	that does not wish to have any interaction with the outside world
296500	300900	and is surrounded by a big, beautiful wall which is guarded by a warrior class.
301300	306700	This is word-for-word what Richard Spencer wants for the white race.
306900	310700	And the king says, you know, maybe we should take refugees in from Africa.
313300	314300	I mean, it's amazing.
314700	316500	What a question to ask.
316700	317700	Should we take...
317700	323300	We have this unified ethnostate that's very powerful based upon technology and respect for our ancestors.
323500	326900	Should we take in refugees from Africa that are black like us?
327100	330900	And the guy's like, eh, you bring refugees in, you bring all their problems too.
331500	332300	So no.
333500	339900	Jeez, I feel a bit out of the loop, you know, like there's some YouTuber newsletter I'm not receiving.
340100	343700	It seems my colleagues across the aisle are all in agreement.
343900	350900	Black Pamphers Wakanda is an alt-right, Trumpist, isolationist, anti-immigrant ethnostate.
351100	355300	So what we're gonna do today is see which words in that sentence are true.
355500	361900	And let's start with ethnostate, that being a state run by and for a particular ethnicity.
362300	366500	A particular ethnicity with a single culture, language, ancestry, and so on.
366500	369900	So is Wakanda one of these ethnostates?
370100	374900	Well, in the opening narration of the movie intended to be watched and understood by children,
374900	380300	it is explained to the audience that Wakanda is a confederation of different tribes of people.
380300	383700	These tribes can assent to or challenge the rule of the king,
383700	389300	and indeed one of the early scenes in the movie features the leader of the Jabari tribe, M'Baku,
389300	391300	challenging T'Challa's rule.
391500	396900	The Jabari tribe live within Wakanda but disagree with how the other tribes live and govern.
397100	400100	They have a different culture to the rest of the Wakandans.
400700	402700	Is Wakanda an ethnostate?
403300	406500	No, it's made up of different ethnicities.
406900	411300	All the YouTube racists have done in declaring Wakanda an ethnostate
411300	416700	is betray what they really mean when they say ethnostate, which is race state.
417300	419900	The different tribes in Wakanda are all black.
420300	425300	So that means that even though the opening narration explains that Wakanda is a confederation
425300	431500	of different tribes of people with different cultures and heritages, whatever, that doesn't matter.
431700	434900	They're black, so they must all be the same, apparently.
435100	437300	So ethnostate is out.
437500	445100	However, Wakanda is a secretive isolationist state that hides its existence from the rest of the world behind a big wall.
445700	454900	That's true at the start of the story, anyway, and then, like in A Christmas Carol, events occur and things change.
455300	457100	Characters have arcs.
457500	461700	The Wakanda at the end of the narrative is different to the Wakanda at the start,
461700	467900	so let's take a look at these videos in more detail and see what, if anything, they have to say about that.
468300	473100	First up is Paul Joseph Watson's The Truth About the Black Panther Movie,
473100	478300	the thumbnail of which features Black Panther in a Trump hat there for some reason.
478500	483500	The Black Panther Movie is a piece of shit. I haven't actually seen it.
483700	488500	Oh, well, okay, fair enough. We'll leave that there, then. That one was easy.
488700	490700	Paul didn't even watch the movie.
490900	496300	You know, why he feels qualified to give his opinion about the movie, having not seen it, is a bit of a mystery.
496900	502300	Now, since he hasn't seen it, this means Paul has to rely on someone else to fill him in.
502500	510300	So Black Lives Matter are portrayed as the villains? The hero is a nationalist? The hero is basically Black Trump?
510500	516900	That's right. Paul thinks that T'Challa is an isolationist nationalist not because he's seen the movie,
517100	523900	but because Ian Myles Chong told him so. Always a trustworthy source of information there.
524100	529700	So what does Paul have to say about T'Challa later revealing Quikanda to the rest of the world
529700	532300	and using its resources to help others?
532900	536500	Nothing, of course, because he hasn't seen the movie.
537100	537900	Honestly.
538300	543300	Let's move on and take a peek at Stefan Molyneux's video, The Truth About Black Panther.
543700	547900	First off, Stefan appears to have actually watched the movie, so well done.
547900	552300	He gets a big gold star for that, and let's see what he thinks of it.
554100	563100	The power of Wakanda is the power of, obviously, this magical vibranium,
563500	570900	but also as they repeat and repeat and repeat throughout the movie, respect your ancestors, love your ancestors,
570900	576500	know your history, live for your people, live for your country, live for your state, live for your tribe.
576700	578900	The tribe is everything. Wakanda forever.
580500	581500	Powerful stuff.
582500	587100	So the strength of a people is in its respect for its ancestors.
589300	594100	So, respecting ancestors is the key to Wakanda's strength.
594300	598300	Now, I don't know what film he watched, but in my cinema,
598300	602700	it showed the Black Panther that includes a scene in which T'Challa, the protagonist,
603100	607700	actually meets his ancestors, the previous Black Panthers, and shouts at them,
608100	613100	you were wrong, all of you were wrong, to turn your back on the rest of the world.
613700	618100	You know, the strict isolationism enforced by Wakanda's previous rulers
618100	622300	is presented as a bad thing that the hero has to overcome.
622900	625900	It creates Killmonger, the antagonist.
626500	631100	T'Challa even outright states, Killmonger is a monster of our own making.
631300	634700	He might as well look right into the camera when he says it as well.
634700	639100	It's like a making sure the kids in the audience follow along moment.
639500	644300	T'Challa's turning point in the movie is when he rejects how his ancestors ruled.
644700	649500	He rejects isolationism and later reveals the existence of Wakanda.
650300	652300	What does Stefan have to say about this?
652900	657500	Well, if you guessed absolutely nothing, congratulations, you're correct.
658300	663500	Stefan actually says remarkably little about the actual movie in his 56-minute video,
663500	668300	choosing instead to deliver his standard, here's-why-colonialism-was-okay speech
668300	671100	for about 95% of the runtime.
671300	676900	Now, Sargon of Akkad surprises by actually mentioning the end of the movie in his video,
676900	679100	The Politics of Black Panther.
679500	684500	Not that he actually factors it into his understanding of the rest of the narrative, however.
684500	687900	He makes a few mistakes in that regard, so let's take a peek.
710100	715500	So, I wasn't surprised to learn that her character was also a far-left, open-borders advocate,
715500	718500	which T'Challa shuts down without any further discussion.
718500	724300	He points out, correctly, that if they let people in, Wakanda will change,
724300	728300	which was a surprisingly woke defense of anti-immigration policies.
728300	732300	So first off, this conversation between T'Challa and his sister Shuri,
732300	737100	the supposed far-left, open-borders advocate, doesn't happen.
737500	740900	The conversation in which T'Challa says he doesn't want to let in refugees
740900	746100	actually takes place between him and Nakia, who is his love interest in the movie.
746100	749700	And this isn't the only time Sargon mixes up these two characters.
749700	751100	He elsewhere states,
768100	773100	Now, is that true? I can't remember that scene happening, honestly.
773100	778100	I remember a scene in which T'Challa talks about Nakia being a queen,
778100	783100	because he's flirting with her, you know, if he marries her, she'll be the queen,
783100	785100	but nothing about Shuri being the queen.
785100	790100	I'm willing to admit being wrong here, you know, maybe my memory is on the fritz as well.
790100	795100	But regardless, Carl uses the conversation between T'Challa and Nakia
795100	797700	as his proof that T'Challa is alt-right.
797700	801900	He also shares a picture of Black Panther in a Trump hat.
801900	807900	So I think I can help Sargon out a little here with my interpretation of the narrative of the film.
807900	813300	There are a few key early scenes in the movie that relate to Wakanda's governance.
813300	818300	First off is T'Challa meeting the spirit of his father and saying he doesn't feel ready to lead
818300	820100	and isn't sure what to do.
820100	821700	And then his father's spirit says,
822700	827700	And the next scene is T'Challa talking to his love interest, Nakia.
827700	831700	He asks her what Wakanda should do, and she says,
836700	839700	The next scene is T'Challa talking to his friend, Wakabi,
839700	842700	who advises him not to let refugees in but says,
842700	846700	hey, if you wanna go fuck some guys up, I'm down with that,
846700	850700	to which T'Challa rebuffs him and says war is not our way.
850700	854700	These scenes set up the core thematic conflict of the movie.
854700	858700	You know, should Wakanda remain hidden or reveal itself to the world?
858700	862700	And if it reveals itself, should that be done peacefully and diplomatically
862700	864700	or in a violent conquest?
864700	869700	T'Challa takes the opposite side in his conversations with both Wakabi and Nakia
869700	871700	because he isn't sure what he should do.
871700	875700	His first real test comes when Everett Ross gets shot.
875700	880700	There's a conversation between Okoye, the partner of Wakabi, and Nakia,
880700	882700	where they again debate the core conflict.
882700	886700	Should we reveal Wakanda in order to help this outsider,
886700	888700	or should we let it remain hidden?
888700	893700	And T'Challa chooses to bring him to Wakanda in order to save his life.
893700	897700	And then later in the story, we of course have the previously mentioned
897700	901700	T'Challa shouting at his ancestors that they were wrong
901700	906700	and finally using Wakanda's resources to help the world at the conclusion of the movie.
906700	909700	So, is T'Challa alt-right?
909700	914700	Well, only if being alt-right means abandoning those principles immediately
914700	918700	in order to do the right thing at every available opportunity.
918700	923700	T'Challa is hesitantly anti-immigration at the beginning of the film,
923700	928700	but then things happen to him and he changes and by the end, he is not.
928700	931700	It's the old Scrooge issue again.
931700	938700	Sargon and Stefan and Paul are relaying only the initial representation of T'Challa and Wakanda
938700	940700	and not the narrative as a whole.
940700	945700	Now, the rest of Sargon's response is filled with similar blustery retellings
945700	948700	of all the terrible things about Wakanda.
948700	951700	You know, as if he's the only one who noticed them.
951700	954700	And I'm not really sure who he's responding to.
954700	960700	You can take a guess, though. Though it's a little convoluted to relay, so stick with me here.
960700	966700	Sargon has seen people he calls SJWs excited about the Black Panther movie,
966700	968700	as, indeed, a lot of people are.
968700	972700	A big-budget movie with a predominantly black cast set in Africa,
972700	976700	you know, it brings some diversity to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
976700	981700	a lot of minorities and those on the left are glad to see the movie doing so well.
981700	986700	But Sargon and other right-wingers see this enthusiasm about what the movie represents
986700	991700	and misinterpret it to be uncritical and unquestioning enthusiasm
991700	994700	for every aspect of every part of the movie.
994700	996700	So when Sargon said,
996700	1002700	all these SJWs are excited to see a representation of a flawless black paradise.
1002700	1005700	And then when he notices that Wakanda is not so,
1005700	1008700	that it's actually a country with problems that need to be overcome,
1008700	1010700	he treats that as a contradiction.
1010700	1016700	You know, this movie isn't living up to my expectation of SJW expectations.
1016700	1018700	Aha, I have caught it out.
1018700	1021700	And Carl, you're off the mark, man.
1021700	1024700	You know, people are just excited to see a black superhero movie.
1024700	1028700	It doesn't mean they now support hereditary monarchies or something,
1028700	1030700	just because there was one in the movie.
1030700	1033700	I mean, I like Thor Ragnarok.
1033700	1035700	That's got a hereditary monarchy in the movie.
1035700	1037700	It doesn't mean I support it, though, does it?
1037700	1040700	That was my Thor Ragnarok callback there.
1040700	1042700	I bet you've forgotten about that.
1042700	1046700	There's another one coming up in a few minutes as well, so be on the lookout.
1046700	1052700	So to demonstrate that us loony SJW types can actually look at the movie critically,
1052700	1054700	I guess I should give my opinions here.
1054700	1058700	So I thought Black Panther was okay.
1058700	1062700	It's probably my second favorite Marvel movie after Thor Ragnarok,
1063700	1067700	though that is not a field with particularly stiff competition.
1067700	1071700	Mostly exceedingly flaccid competition, actually.
1071700	1077700	All the positive things about Black Panther were held back in part by the constraints of the medium.
1077700	1082700	It is ultimately a comic book movie and comes with all the problems that that entails.
1082700	1089700	You know, regardless of politics, you know the final confrontation is gonna be between two punch men punching each other
1089700	1092700	until the good guy punches the best and wins.
1092700	1097700	Now, Black Panther attempts to give the villain Killmonger some complexity.
1097700	1102700	As much complexity as one can give a character called Killmonger, anyway.
1102700	1105700	But it ultimately needs the audience to side with Black Panther,
1105700	1111700	so it tempers that complexity with having Killmonger just do horrible things from time to time.
1111700	1117700	And this good versus evil simplification bleeds into the wider conflict of the movie as well.
1117700	1122700	Killmongers was the bad way to reveal Wakanda to the world, and T'Challa's is the good way.
1122700	1125700	When, really, it's more complex than that.
1125700	1129700	You know, what happens if T'Challa tries to give aid to a country and they refuse?
1129700	1133700	Or if the government keeps all the aid for themselves while letting their people starve?
1133700	1137700	You know, will he then intervene or just abandon those people?
1137700	1142700	It's a pretty tough question, and the movie kinda rushes past this problem at the end there.
1142700	1146700	But they have to save something for Black Panther 2, I guess.
1146700	1152700	So, T'Challa's peaceful diplomatic aid outreach thing felt a little thin to me.
1152700	1158700	Now, obviously, starting a race war as Killmonger wanted is hardly a perfect option either.
1158700	1162700	But these two philosophies are not the only two that are available.
1162700	1165700	But, again, it's a Marvel movie.
1165700	1171700	The closer that Black Panther gets to real-world problems and situations, the duller its edge gets.
1171700	1175700	You know, it's held back by its proximity to reality, I guess.
1175700	1178700	There's almost no white racism in the movie, for instance.
1178700	1181700	And for a movie that references colonialism a bunch,
1181700	1186700	having the conflict be between a black man and his cousin within a royal family at that,
1186700	1189700	it felt like an imposed half-measure.
1189700	1194700	You know, they want this movie to sell to white audiences too, clearly.
1194700	1200700	The more direct colonialist story would be the world finding out about Wakanda's vibranium deposits
1200700	1204700	and invading it to plunder them, and having Wakanda have to fight back.
1204700	1208700	But that story would be a little embarrassing, I imagine.
1208700	1212700	This is partly why I prefer Thor Ragnarok to Black Panther,
1212700	1216700	because the Thor movie, being set in a fictional space empire,
1216700	1219700	has a lot more freedom to go where the story needs to.
1219700	1225700	You can have Thor recognize that colonialist Asgard needs to be destroyed,
1225700	1229700	and doing it, and setting out to create a better society,
1229700	1234700	but you can't have Wakanda being invaded by a real country that actually exists on Earth,
1234700	1236700	and then have Wakanda destroy it.
1236700	1239700	Though that is fun to imagine.
1239700	1245700	The one other criticism I have of Black Panther is one I also have for Thor Ragnarok,
1245700	1249700	that it doesn't drop the hereditary monarchy at the end of the movie.
1249700	1256700	Looking at this list again, the one and only point that remains true by the end of the movie is anti-democracy.
1256700	1260700	Now, the movie does communicate that absolute monarchy is a bad thing.
1260700	1263700	It means someone like Killmonger can usurp the throne,
1263700	1268700	and Okoye turning on King Killmonger is presented heroically, for instance.
1268700	1271700	But I'd have preferred a more direct condemnation
1271700	1275700	for the less discerning viewers in the audience, shall we say.
1275700	1278700	You know, a little tacked-on conversation at the end.
1278700	1282700	By the way, that Killmonger thing sucked. We should probably have elections instead.
1282700	1284700	You know, that wouldn't have been hard to do.
1285700	1289700	If I were making the sequel, that would probably be the first plot point.
1289700	1293700	All that said, I still enjoyed Black Panther, and I'm excited about it,
1293700	1296700	particularly in a sign-of-things-to-come type fashion.
1296700	1302700	The more that Hollywood gets used to the idea that it does not only need to tell white stories,
1302700	1305700	the more stories we'll all have to enjoy.
1305700	1306700	And isn't that neat?
1306700	1310700	And I guess at the conclusion here, I should return and answer the opening question.
1310700	1313700	Is Black Panther alt-right?
1313700	1316700	No.
1343700	1346700	All of whom are brilliant.
