1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about Black Panther, the latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe of movies

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,000
featuring heroes with superhuman abilities.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,900
But first of all, we need to talk about A Christmas Carol.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,800
So, the main character in A Christmas Carol is, of course, Ebenezer Scrooge.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,200
And I'll show here a picture of Michael Caine in The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is by far the best adaptation.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,500
And I'd like you to be a bit of a guinea pig in a little experiment of mine right now.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,800
How would you describe the character of Ebenezer Scrooge?

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,200
Now, this might seem silly, but it does have a point.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,600
So, what is Scrooge like?

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,800
Well, he's selfish, he's miserly, he's cold-hearted, unpleasant.

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,700
You know, you get the picture.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,300
Hard and sharp as a flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,300
Secret and self-contained and solitary as an oyster.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,900
So, my question is this.

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,000
Why is this the image of Scrooge that persists?

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Because, of course, this is only Scrooge's character at the start of the narrative.

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,900
But then, you know, things happen to him and he changes.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:20,900
A Christmas Carol is the story of how Scrooge transforms from a cold, cruel person into a generous, kind person.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,900
Yet, we understand that if someone calls another person Scrooge,

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,900
they're saying they're unkind and mean, rather than as good a man as the good old city knew,

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,900
as Dickens describes Scrooge by the end of the story.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
So, why is this?

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Well, I don't know.

24
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,100
You know, it's just something I noticed.

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,300
And maybe it's just that first impressions count a lot.

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,700
You know, maybe the most memorable characters and places and things in a story just more naturally occur at the start,

27
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,700
before the narrative has a chance to smooth out the edges on its way to bringing the story to a resolution.

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,700
Scrooge certainly stands out more at the start of the book than at the end.

29
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,500
So, anyway, let's seemingly abandon this point here and move on to talk about Black Panther.

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,700
And fair warning, there will be spoilers in this video.

31
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,500
Not just for Black Panther, but for for Ragnarok as well.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,100
And, well, a Christmas carol, too, I guess.

33
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,500
It's a bit late for that now, though.

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,500
So, why will there be spoilers for for Ragnarok in this video?

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,700
Well, that's because both it and Black Panther follow a very similar story structure,

36
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,900
which I'll just outline rather quickly here.

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,300
So, the main character of the story is a prince who is the heir to a kingdom.

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,100
His father is the king, and in the mind of the prince,

39
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,900
he's a great leader who the prince does not yet feel ready to replace.

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,100
However, following the death of the king,

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,300
the prince finds out a terrible secret about something his father did in the past,

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,900
something that creates the antagonizing force in the movie.

43
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,900
In Thor, Odin imprisoned his firstborn child, Hela, after she helped him conquer the Nine Realms.

44
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,900
And in Black Panther, King T'Chaka killed his own brother and abandons his nephew,

45
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,300
who returns later, like Hela, seeking revenge.

46
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,500
The prince is initially defeated and depowered.

47
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,300
Thor loses his hammer, T'Challa loses his... cat powers.

48
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,500
And this sets them up to later return, regain their powers, defeat the antagonist,

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,700
and prevent them from doing something terrible.

50
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,700
And in the process, the prince decides he will have to radically transform his society.

51
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,900
Thor intentionally destroys Asgard in order to defeat Hela,

52
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,500
and T'Challa, at the conclusion of the movie,

53
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,700
reveals the existence of Wakanda to the rest of the world.

54
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,300
So we're here to talk about Black Panther.

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,900
So why am I mentioning its similarity to Thor Ragnarok?

56
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,300
You know, am I really trying to show off that I noticed two Marvel superhero movies were similar?

57
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,900
Well, a little bit.

58
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,700
But it does tie into a point I want to make later.

59
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,700
So, I've teed up two different points at the start of the video here.

60
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,900
The Scrooge thing and the Thor Ragnarok thing.

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,300
And let's leave them both dangling there awkwardly

62
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,700
and move on to answer today's apparently pressing question.

63
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,300
Is Wakanda an alt-right ethnostate?

64
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Wakanda is the alt-right's paradise.

65
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,900
And every single inhabitant of Wakanda,

66
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,100
with the exception of T'Challa's sister, is alt-right.

67
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:27,700
Wakanda is actually almost identical to the very stereotype of what you say Trump is trying to create in America.

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,900
Wakanda is homogenous.

69
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,500
Wakanda is isolationist.

70
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Wakanda is willing to exploit its natural resources.

71
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,100
Wakanda is protected by walls.

72
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,300
Wakanda doesn't allow immigration.

73
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Wakanda is based around national self-interest.

74
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,700
That's literally everything you say Trump is bad for doing.

75
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,700
But when fictional black people are doing it, suddenly it's amazing.

76
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,500
Wakanda is a xenophobic, high-tech, space-age ethnostate

77
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,500
that does not wish to have any interaction with the outside world

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,900
and is surrounded by a big, beautiful wall which is guarded by a warrior class.

79
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,700
This is word-for-word what Richard Spencer wants for the white race.

80
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,700
And the king says, you know, maybe we should take refugees in from Africa.

81
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
I mean, it's amazing.

82
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,500
What a question to ask.

83
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
Should we take...

84
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,300
We have this unified ethnostate that's very powerful based upon technology and respect for our ancestors.

85
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,900
Should we take in refugees from Africa that are black like us?

86
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,900
And the guy's like, eh, you bring refugees in, you bring all their problems too.

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,300
So no.

88
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,900
Jeez, I feel a bit out of the loop, you know, like there's some YouTuber newsletter I'm not receiving.

89
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,700
It seems my colleagues across the aisle are all in agreement.

90
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,900
Black Pamphers Wakanda is an alt-right, Trumpist, isolationist, anti-immigrant ethnostate.

91
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,300
So what we're gonna do today is see which words in that sentence are true.

92
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,900
And let's start with ethnostate, that being a state run by and for a particular ethnicity.

93
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,500
A particular ethnicity with a single culture, language, ancestry, and so on.

94
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,900
So is Wakanda one of these ethnostates?

95
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,900
Well, in the opening narration of the movie intended to be watched and understood by children,

96
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,300
it is explained to the audience that Wakanda is a confederation of different tribes of people.

97
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,700
These tribes can assent to or challenge the rule of the king,

98
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,300
and indeed one of the early scenes in the movie features the leader of the Jabari tribe, M'Baku,

99
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
challenging T'Challa's rule.

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,900
The Jabari tribe live within Wakanda but disagree with how the other tribes live and govern.

101
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,100
They have a different culture to the rest of the Wakandans.

102
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Is Wakanda an ethnostate?

103
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,500
No, it's made up of different ethnicities.

104
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,300
All the YouTube racists have done in declaring Wakanda an ethnostate

105
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,700
is betray what they really mean when they say ethnostate, which is race state.

106
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,900
The different tribes in Wakanda are all black.

107
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,300
So that means that even though the opening narration explains that Wakanda is a confederation

108
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,500
of different tribes of people with different cultures and heritages, whatever, that doesn't matter.

109
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,900
They're black, so they must all be the same, apparently.

110
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,300
So ethnostate is out.

111
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:25,100
However, Wakanda is a secretive isolationist state that hides its existence from the rest of the world behind a big wall.

112
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:34,900
That's true at the start of the story, anyway, and then, like in A Christmas Carol, events occur and things change.

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,100
Characters have arcs.

114
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,700
The Wakanda at the end of the narrative is different to the Wakanda at the start,

115
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,900
so let's take a look at these videos in more detail and see what, if anything, they have to say about that.

116
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,100
First up is Paul Joseph Watson's The Truth About the Black Panther Movie,

117
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,300
the thumbnail of which features Black Panther in a Trump hat there for some reason.

118
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,500
The Black Panther Movie is a piece of shit. I haven't actually seen it.

119
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,500
Oh, well, okay, fair enough. We'll leave that there, then. That one was easy.

120
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
Paul didn't even watch the movie.

121
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,300
You know, why he feels qualified to give his opinion about the movie, having not seen it, is a bit of a mystery.

122
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,300
Now, since he hasn't seen it, this means Paul has to rely on someone else to fill him in.

123
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:30,300
So Black Lives Matter are portrayed as the villains? The hero is a nationalist? The hero is basically Black Trump?

124
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,900
That's right. Paul thinks that T'Challa is an isolationist nationalist not because he's seen the movie,

125
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,900
but because Ian Myles Chong told him so. Always a trustworthy source of information there.

126
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,700
So what does Paul have to say about T'Challa later revealing Quikanda to the rest of the world

127
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,300
and using its resources to help others?

128
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,500
Nothing, of course, because he hasn't seen the movie.

129
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,900
Honestly.

130
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,300
Let's move on and take a peek at Stefan Molyneux's video, The Truth About Black Panther.

131
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,900
First off, Stefan appears to have actually watched the movie, so well done.

132
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,300
He gets a big gold star for that, and let's see what he thinks of it.

133
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:23,100
The power of Wakanda is the power of, obviously, this magical vibranium,

134
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:30,900
but also as they repeat and repeat and repeat throughout the movie, respect your ancestors, love your ancestors,

135
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,500
know your history, live for your people, live for your country, live for your state, live for your tribe.

136
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,900
The tribe is everything. Wakanda forever.

137
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Powerful stuff.

138
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,100
So the strength of a people is in its respect for its ancestors.

139
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,100
So, respecting ancestors is the key to Wakanda's strength.

140
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Now, I don't know what film he watched, but in my cinema,

141
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,700
it showed the Black Panther that includes a scene in which T'Challa, the protagonist,

142
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,700
actually meets his ancestors, the previous Black Panthers, and shouts at them,

143
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,100
you were wrong, all of you were wrong, to turn your back on the rest of the world.

144
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,100
You know, the strict isolationism enforced by Wakanda's previous rulers

145
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,300
is presented as a bad thing that the hero has to overcome.

146
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,900
It creates Killmonger, the antagonist.

147
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,100
T'Challa even outright states, Killmonger is a monster of our own making.

148
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,700
He might as well look right into the camera when he says it as well.

149
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,100
It's like a making sure the kids in the audience follow along moment.

150
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,300
T'Challa's turning point in the movie is when he rejects how his ancestors ruled.

151
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,500
He rejects isolationism and later reveals the existence of Wakanda.

152
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
What does Stefan have to say about this?

153
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,500
Well, if you guessed absolutely nothing, congratulations, you're correct.

154
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,500
Stefan actually says remarkably little about the actual movie in his 56-minute video,

155
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,300
choosing instead to deliver his standard, here's-why-colonialism-was-okay speech

156
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,100
for about 95% of the runtime.

157
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,900
Now, Sargon of Akkad surprises by actually mentioning the end of the movie in his video,

158
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,100
The Politics of Black Panther.

159
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Not that he actually factors it into his understanding of the rest of the narrative, however.

160
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,900
He makes a few mistakes in that regard, so let's take a peek.

161
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,500
So, I wasn't surprised to learn that her character was also a far-left, open-borders advocate,

162
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
which T'Challa shuts down without any further discussion.

163
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,300
He points out, correctly, that if they let people in, Wakanda will change,

164
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,300
which was a surprisingly woke defense of anti-immigration policies.

165
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,300
So first off, this conversation between T'Challa and his sister Shuri,

166
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,100
the supposed far-left, open-borders advocate, doesn't happen.

167
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,900
The conversation in which T'Challa says he doesn't want to let in refugees

168
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,100
actually takes place between him and Nakia, who is his love interest in the movie.

169
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,700
And this isn't the only time Sargon mixes up these two characters.

170
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,100
He elsewhere states,

171
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Now, is that true? I can't remember that scene happening, honestly.

172
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,100
I remember a scene in which T'Challa talks about Nakia being a queen,

173
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,100
because he's flirting with her, you know, if he marries her, she'll be the queen,

174
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
but nothing about Shuri being the queen.

175
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,100
I'm willing to admit being wrong here, you know, maybe my memory is on the fritz as well.

176
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,100
But regardless, Carl uses the conversation between T'Challa and Nakia

177
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,700
as his proof that T'Challa is alt-right.

178
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,900
He also shares a picture of Black Panther in a Trump hat.

179
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:27,900
So I think I can help Sargon out a little here with my interpretation of the narrative of the film.

180
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:33,300
There are a few key early scenes in the movie that relate to Wakanda's governance.

181
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,300
First off is T'Challa meeting the spirit of his father and saying he doesn't feel ready to lead

182
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,100
and isn't sure what to do.

183
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,700
And then his father's spirit says,

184
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,700
And the next scene is T'Challa talking to his love interest, Nakia.

185
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,700
He asks her what Wakanda should do, and she says,

186
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,700
The next scene is T'Challa talking to his friend, Wakabi,

187
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,700
who advises him not to let refugees in but says,

188
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,700
hey, if you wanna go fuck some guys up, I'm down with that,

189
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,700
to which T'Challa rebuffs him and says war is not our way.

190
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,700
These scenes set up the core thematic conflict of the movie.

191
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,700
You know, should Wakanda remain hidden or reveal itself to the world?

192
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,700
And if it reveals itself, should that be done peacefully and diplomatically

193
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
or in a violent conquest?

194
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,700
T'Challa takes the opposite side in his conversations with both Wakabi and Nakia

195
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
because he isn't sure what he should do.

196
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,700
His first real test comes when Everett Ross gets shot.

197
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,700
There's a conversation between Okoye, the partner of Wakabi, and Nakia,

198
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
where they again debate the core conflict.

199
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Should we reveal Wakanda in order to help this outsider,

200
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
or should we let it remain hidden?

201
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,700
And T'Challa chooses to bring him to Wakanda in order to save his life.

202
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,700
And then later in the story, we of course have the previously mentioned

203
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,700
T'Challa shouting at his ancestors that they were wrong

204
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,700
and finally using Wakanda's resources to help the world at the conclusion of the movie.

205
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,700
So, is T'Challa alt-right?

206
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Well, only if being alt-right means abandoning those principles immediately

207
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,700
in order to do the right thing at every available opportunity.

208
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,700
T'Challa is hesitantly anti-immigration at the beginning of the film,

209
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,700
but then things happen to him and he changes and by the end, he is not.

210
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,700
It's the old Scrooge issue again.

211
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Sargon and Stefan and Paul are relaying only the initial representation of T'Challa and Wakanda

212
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
and not the narrative as a whole.

213
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Now, the rest of Sargon's response is filled with similar blustery retellings

214
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,700
of all the terrible things about Wakanda.

215
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,700
You know, as if he's the only one who noticed them.

216
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,700
And I'm not really sure who he's responding to.

217
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:00,700
You can take a guess, though. Though it's a little convoluted to relay, so stick with me here.

218
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Sargon has seen people he calls SJWs excited about the Black Panther movie,

219
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
as, indeed, a lot of people are.

220
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,700
A big-budget movie with a predominantly black cast set in Africa,

221
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,700
you know, it brings some diversity to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

222
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,700
a lot of minorities and those on the left are glad to see the movie doing so well.

223
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,700
But Sargon and other right-wingers see this enthusiasm about what the movie represents

224
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,700
and misinterpret it to be uncritical and unquestioning enthusiasm

225
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,700
for every aspect of every part of the movie.

226
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
So when Sargon said,

227
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,700
all these SJWs are excited to see a representation of a flawless black paradise.

228
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,700
And then when he notices that Wakanda is not so,

229
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,700
that it's actually a country with problems that need to be overcome,

230
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
he treats that as a contradiction.

231
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,700
You know, this movie isn't living up to my expectation of SJW expectations.

232
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Aha, I have caught it out.

233
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,700
And Carl, you're off the mark, man.

234
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,700
You know, people are just excited to see a black superhero movie.

235
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,700
It doesn't mean they now support hereditary monarchies or something,

236
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
just because there was one in the movie.

237
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
I mean, I like Thor Ragnarok.

238
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
That's got a hereditary monarchy in the movie.

239
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
It doesn't mean I support it, though, does it?

240
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,700
That was my Thor Ragnarok callback there.

241
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
I bet you've forgotten about that.

242
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,700
There's another one coming up in a few minutes as well, so be on the lookout.

243
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:32,700
So to demonstrate that us loony SJW types can actually look at the movie critically,

244
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
I guess I should give my opinions here.

245
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,700
So I thought Black Panther was okay.

246
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,700
It's probably my second favorite Marvel movie after Thor Ragnarok,

247
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,700
though that is not a field with particularly stiff competition.

248
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,700
Mostly exceedingly flaccid competition, actually.

249
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,700
All the positive things about Black Panther were held back in part by the constraints of the medium.

250
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,700
It is ultimately a comic book movie and comes with all the problems that that entails.

251
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:09,700
You know, regardless of politics, you know the final confrontation is gonna be between two punch men punching each other

252
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,700
until the good guy punches the best and wins.

253
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Now, Black Panther attempts to give the villain Killmonger some complexity.

254
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,700
As much complexity as one can give a character called Killmonger, anyway.

255
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,700
But it ultimately needs the audience to side with Black Panther,

256
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,700
so it tempers that complexity with having Killmonger just do horrible things from time to time.

257
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,700
And this good versus evil simplification bleeds into the wider conflict of the movie as well.

258
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Killmongers was the bad way to reveal Wakanda to the world, and T'Challa's is the good way.

259
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,700
When, really, it's more complex than that.

260
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,700
You know, what happens if T'Challa tries to give aid to a country and they refuse?

261
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Or if the government keeps all the aid for themselves while letting their people starve?

262
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,700
You know, will he then intervene or just abandon those people?

263
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,700
It's a pretty tough question, and the movie kinda rushes past this problem at the end there.

264
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,700
But they have to save something for Black Panther 2, I guess.

265
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,700
So, T'Challa's peaceful diplomatic aid outreach thing felt a little thin to me.

266
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Now, obviously, starting a race war as Killmonger wanted is hardly a perfect option either.

267
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,700
But these two philosophies are not the only two that are available.

268
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,700
But, again, it's a Marvel movie.

269
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,700
The closer that Black Panther gets to real-world problems and situations, the duller its edge gets.

270
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,700
You know, it's held back by its proximity to reality, I guess.

271
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,700
There's almost no white racism in the movie, for instance.

272
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,700
And for a movie that references colonialism a bunch,

273
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,700
having the conflict be between a black man and his cousin within a royal family at that,

274
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,700
it felt like an imposed half-measure.

275
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,700
You know, they want this movie to sell to white audiences too, clearly.

276
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,700
The more direct colonialist story would be the world finding out about Wakanda's vibranium deposits

277
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,700
and invading it to plunder them, and having Wakanda have to fight back.

278
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,700
But that story would be a little embarrassing, I imagine.

279
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,700
This is partly why I prefer Thor Ragnarok to Black Panther,

280
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,700
because the Thor movie, being set in a fictional space empire,

281
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,700
has a lot more freedom to go where the story needs to.

282
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,700
You can have Thor recognize that colonialist Asgard needs to be destroyed,

283
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,700
and doing it, and setting out to create a better society,

284
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,700
but you can't have Wakanda being invaded by a real country that actually exists on Earth,

285
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,700
and then have Wakanda destroy it.

286
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Though that is fun to imagine.

287
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:45,700
The one other criticism I have of Black Panther is one I also have for Thor Ragnarok,

288
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,700
that it doesn't drop the hereditary monarchy at the end of the movie.

289
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Looking at this list again, the one and only point that remains true by the end of the movie is anti-democracy.

290
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Now, the movie does communicate that absolute monarchy is a bad thing.

291
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,700
It means someone like Killmonger can usurp the throne,

292
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,700
and Okoye turning on King Killmonger is presented heroically, for instance.

293
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
But I'd have preferred a more direct condemnation

294
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,700
for the less discerning viewers in the audience, shall we say.

295
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,700
You know, a little tacked-on conversation at the end.

296
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,700
By the way, that Killmonger thing sucked. We should probably have elections instead.

297
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
You know, that wouldn't have been hard to do.

298
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,700
If I were making the sequel, that would probably be the first plot point.

299
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,700
All that said, I still enjoyed Black Panther, and I'm excited about it,

300
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,700
particularly in a sign-of-things-to-come type fashion.

301
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,700
The more that Hollywood gets used to the idea that it does not only need to tell white stories,

302
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,700
the more stories we'll all have to enjoy.

303
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
And isn't that neat?

304
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,700
And I guess at the conclusion here, I should return and answer the opening question.

305
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Is Black Panther alt-right?

306
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,700
No.

307
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,700
All of whom are brilliant.

308
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
Head over there and check it out, if you like.

309
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,700
And also follow me on Twitter or send me a question on Curious Cat.

310
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
I will put the links below.

311
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Thanks a lot, folks. I'll see you next time.
