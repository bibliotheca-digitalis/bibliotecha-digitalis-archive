00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about Black Panther, the latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe of movies

00:07.600 --> 00:11.000
featuring heroes with superhuman abilities.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.900
But first of all, we need to talk about A Christmas Carol.

00:14.900 --> 00:19.800
So, the main character in A Christmas Carol is, of course, Ebenezer Scrooge.

00:19.800 --> 00:26.200
And I'll show here a picture of Michael Caine in The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is by far the best adaptation.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.500
And I'd like you to be a bit of a guinea pig in a little experiment of mine right now.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.800
How would you describe the character of Ebenezer Scrooge?

00:35.400 --> 00:38.200
Now, this might seem silly, but it does have a point.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.600
So, what is Scrooge like?

00:40.600 --> 00:46.800
Well, he's selfish, he's miserly, he's cold-hearted, unpleasant.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.700
You know, you get the picture.

00:49.100 --> 00:54.300
Hard and sharp as a flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.

00:54.300 --> 00:58.300
Secret and self-contained and solitary as an oyster.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.900
So, my question is this.

01:00.900 --> 01:04.000
Why is this the image of Scrooge that persists?

01:04.500 --> 01:08.500
Because, of course, this is only Scrooge's character at the start of the narrative.

01:09.100 --> 01:12.900
But then, you know, things happen to him and he changes.

01:13.300 --> 01:20.900
A Christmas Carol is the story of how Scrooge transforms from a cold, cruel person into a generous, kind person.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.900
Yet, we understand that if someone calls another person Scrooge,

01:24.900 --> 01:30.900
they're saying they're unkind and mean, rather than as good a man as the good old city knew,

01:30.900 --> 01:33.900
as Dickens describes Scrooge by the end of the story.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.500
So, why is this?

01:36.300 --> 01:37.300
Well, I don't know.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.100
You know, it's just something I noticed.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.300
And maybe it's just that first impressions count a lot.

01:42.900 --> 01:48.700
You know, maybe the most memorable characters and places and things in a story just more naturally occur at the start,

01:48.700 --> 01:54.700
before the narrative has a chance to smooth out the edges on its way to bringing the story to a resolution.

01:55.100 --> 01:59.700
Scrooge certainly stands out more at the start of the book than at the end.

02:00.100 --> 02:05.500
So, anyway, let's seemingly abandon this point here and move on to talk about Black Panther.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.700
And fair warning, there will be spoilers in this video.

02:08.700 --> 02:12.500
Not just for Black Panther, but for for Ragnarok as well.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.100
And, well, a Christmas carol, too, I guess.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.500
It's a bit late for that now, though.

02:18.100 --> 02:21.500
So, why will there be spoilers for for Ragnarok in this video?

02:21.900 --> 02:26.700
Well, that's because both it and Black Panther follow a very similar story structure,

02:26.700 --> 02:28.900
which I'll just outline rather quickly here.

02:29.300 --> 02:33.300
So, the main character of the story is a prince who is the heir to a kingdom.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.100
His father is the king, and in the mind of the prince,

02:36.100 --> 02:39.900
he's a great leader who the prince does not yet feel ready to replace.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.100
However, following the death of the king,

02:42.100 --> 02:46.300
the prince finds out a terrible secret about something his father did in the past,

02:46.300 --> 02:49.900
something that creates the antagonizing force in the movie.

02:50.100 --> 02:55.900
In Thor, Odin imprisoned his firstborn child, Hela, after she helped him conquer the Nine Realms.

02:56.100 --> 03:00.900
And in Black Panther, King T'Chaka killed his own brother and abandons his nephew,

03:01.100 --> 03:04.300
who returns later, like Hela, seeking revenge.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.500
The prince is initially defeated and depowered.

03:07.700 --> 03:12.300
Thor loses his hammer, T'Challa loses his... cat powers.

03:12.700 --> 03:17.500
And this sets them up to later return, regain their powers, defeat the antagonist,

03:17.500 --> 03:19.700
and prevent them from doing something terrible.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.700
And in the process, the prince decides he will have to radically transform his society.

03:25.100 --> 03:28.900
Thor intentionally destroys Asgard in order to defeat Hela,

03:29.100 --> 03:31.500
and T'Challa, at the conclusion of the movie,

03:31.700 --> 03:34.700
reveals the existence of Wakanda to the rest of the world.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.300
So we're here to talk about Black Panther.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.900
So why am I mentioning its similarity to Thor Ragnarok?

03:40.900 --> 03:46.300
You know, am I really trying to show off that I noticed two Marvel superhero movies were similar?

03:47.100 --> 03:47.900
Well, a little bit.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.700
But it does tie into a point I want to make later.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.700
So, I've teed up two different points at the start of the video here.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.900
The Scrooge thing and the Thor Ragnarok thing.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.300
And let's leave them both dangling there awkwardly

04:00.300 --> 04:04.700
and move on to answer today's apparently pressing question.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.300
Is Wakanda an alt-right ethnostate?

04:08.700 --> 04:12.700
Wakanda is the alt-right's paradise.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.900
And every single inhabitant of Wakanda,

04:16.100 --> 04:20.100
with the exception of T'Challa's sister, is alt-right.

04:20.100 --> 04:27.700
Wakanda is actually almost identical to the very stereotype of what you say Trump is trying to create in America.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.900
Wakanda is homogenous.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.500
Wakanda is isolationist.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.500
Wakanda is willing to exploit its natural resources.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.100
Wakanda is protected by walls.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.300
Wakanda doesn't allow immigration.

04:38.300 --> 04:41.300
Wakanda is based around national self-interest.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.700
That's literally everything you say Trump is bad for doing.

04:44.700 --> 04:48.700
But when fictional black people are doing it, suddenly it's amazing.

04:49.100 --> 04:53.500
Wakanda is a xenophobic, high-tech, space-age ethnostate

04:53.700 --> 04:56.500
that does not wish to have any interaction with the outside world

04:56.500 --> 05:00.900
and is surrounded by a big, beautiful wall which is guarded by a warrior class.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.700
This is word-for-word what Richard Spencer wants for the white race.

05:06.900 --> 05:10.700
And the king says, you know, maybe we should take refugees in from Africa.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.300
I mean, it's amazing.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.500
What a question to ask.

05:16.700 --> 05:17.700
Should we take...

05:17.700 --> 05:23.300
We have this unified ethnostate that's very powerful based upon technology and respect for our ancestors.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.900
Should we take in refugees from Africa that are black like us?

05:27.100 --> 05:30.900
And the guy's like, eh, you bring refugees in, you bring all their problems too.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.300
So no.

05:33.500 --> 05:39.900
Jeez, I feel a bit out of the loop, you know, like there's some YouTuber newsletter I'm not receiving.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.700
It seems my colleagues across the aisle are all in agreement.

05:43.900 --> 05:50.900
Black Pamphers Wakanda is an alt-right, Trumpist, isolationist, anti-immigrant ethnostate.

05:51.100 --> 05:55.300
So what we're gonna do today is see which words in that sentence are true.

05:55.500 --> 06:01.900
And let's start with ethnostate, that being a state run by and for a particular ethnicity.

06:02.300 --> 06:06.500
A particular ethnicity with a single culture, language, ancestry, and so on.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.900
So is Wakanda one of these ethnostates?

06:10.100 --> 06:14.900
Well, in the opening narration of the movie intended to be watched and understood by children,

06:14.900 --> 06:20.300
it is explained to the audience that Wakanda is a confederation of different tribes of people.

06:20.300 --> 06:23.700
These tribes can assent to or challenge the rule of the king,

06:23.700 --> 06:29.300
and indeed one of the early scenes in the movie features the leader of the Jabari tribe, M'Baku,

06:29.300 --> 06:31.300
challenging T'Challa's rule.

06:31.500 --> 06:36.900
The Jabari tribe live within Wakanda but disagree with how the other tribes live and govern.

06:37.100 --> 06:40.100
They have a different culture to the rest of the Wakandans.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.700
Is Wakanda an ethnostate?

06:43.300 --> 06:46.500
No, it's made up of different ethnicities.

06:46.900 --> 06:51.300
All the YouTube racists have done in declaring Wakanda an ethnostate

06:51.300 --> 06:56.700
is betray what they really mean when they say ethnostate, which is race state.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.900
The different tribes in Wakanda are all black.

07:00.300 --> 07:05.300
So that means that even though the opening narration explains that Wakanda is a confederation

07:05.300 --> 07:11.500
of different tribes of people with different cultures and heritages, whatever, that doesn't matter.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.900
They're black, so they must all be the same, apparently.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.300
So ethnostate is out.

07:17.500 --> 07:25.100
However, Wakanda is a secretive isolationist state that hides its existence from the rest of the world behind a big wall.

07:25.700 --> 07:34.900
That's true at the start of the story, anyway, and then, like in A Christmas Carol, events occur and things change.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.100
Characters have arcs.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.700
The Wakanda at the end of the narrative is different to the Wakanda at the start,

07:41.700 --> 07:47.900
so let's take a look at these videos in more detail and see what, if anything, they have to say about that.

07:48.300 --> 07:53.100
First up is Paul Joseph Watson's The Truth About the Black Panther Movie,

07:53.100 --> 07:58.300
the thumbnail of which features Black Panther in a Trump hat there for some reason.

07:58.500 --> 08:03.500
The Black Panther Movie is a piece of shit. I haven't actually seen it.

08:03.700 --> 08:08.500
Oh, well, okay, fair enough. We'll leave that there, then. That one was easy.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.700
Paul didn't even watch the movie.

08:10.900 --> 08:16.300
You know, why he feels qualified to give his opinion about the movie, having not seen it, is a bit of a mystery.

08:16.900 --> 08:22.300
Now, since he hasn't seen it, this means Paul has to rely on someone else to fill him in.

08:22.500 --> 08:30.300
So Black Lives Matter are portrayed as the villains? The hero is a nationalist? The hero is basically Black Trump?

08:30.500 --> 08:36.900
That's right. Paul thinks that T'Challa is an isolationist nationalist not because he's seen the movie,

08:37.100 --> 08:43.900
but because Ian Myles Chong told him so. Always a trustworthy source of information there.

08:44.100 --> 08:49.700
So what does Paul have to say about T'Challa later revealing Quikanda to the rest of the world

08:49.700 --> 08:52.300
and using its resources to help others?

08:52.900 --> 08:56.500
Nothing, of course, because he hasn't seen the movie.

08:57.100 --> 08:57.900
Honestly.

08:58.300 --> 09:03.300
Let's move on and take a peek at Stefan Molyneux's video, The Truth About Black Panther.

09:03.700 --> 09:07.900
First off, Stefan appears to have actually watched the movie, so well done.

09:07.900 --> 09:12.300
He gets a big gold star for that, and let's see what he thinks of it.

09:14.100 --> 09:23.100
The power of Wakanda is the power of, obviously, this magical vibranium,

09:23.500 --> 09:30.900
but also as they repeat and repeat and repeat throughout the movie, respect your ancestors, love your ancestors,

09:30.900 --> 09:36.500
know your history, live for your people, live for your country, live for your state, live for your tribe.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.900
The tribe is everything. Wakanda forever.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.500
Powerful stuff.

09:42.500 --> 09:47.100
So the strength of a people is in its respect for its ancestors.

09:49.300 --> 09:54.100
So, respecting ancestors is the key to Wakanda's strength.

09:54.300 --> 09:58.300
Now, I don't know what film he watched, but in my cinema,

09:58.300 --> 10:02.700
it showed the Black Panther that includes a scene in which T'Challa, the protagonist,

10:03.100 --> 10:07.700
actually meets his ancestors, the previous Black Panthers, and shouts at them,

10:08.100 --> 10:13.100
you were wrong, all of you were wrong, to turn your back on the rest of the world.

10:13.700 --> 10:18.100
You know, the strict isolationism enforced by Wakanda's previous rulers

10:18.100 --> 10:22.300
is presented as a bad thing that the hero has to overcome.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.900
It creates Killmonger, the antagonist.

10:26.500 --> 10:31.100
T'Challa even outright states, Killmonger is a monster of our own making.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.700
He might as well look right into the camera when he says it as well.

10:34.700 --> 10:39.100
It's like a making sure the kids in the audience follow along moment.

10:39.500 --> 10:44.300
T'Challa's turning point in the movie is when he rejects how his ancestors ruled.

10:44.700 --> 10:49.500
He rejects isolationism and later reveals the existence of Wakanda.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.300
What does Stefan have to say about this?

10:52.900 --> 10:57.500
Well, if you guessed absolutely nothing, congratulations, you're correct.

10:58.300 --> 11:03.500
Stefan actually says remarkably little about the actual movie in his 56-minute video,

11:03.500 --> 11:08.300
choosing instead to deliver his standard, here's-why-colonialism-was-okay speech

11:08.300 --> 11:11.100
for about 95% of the runtime.

11:11.300 --> 11:16.900
Now, Sargon of Akkad surprises by actually mentioning the end of the movie in his video,

11:16.900 --> 11:19.100
The Politics of Black Panther.

11:19.500 --> 11:24.500
Not that he actually factors it into his understanding of the rest of the narrative, however.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.900
He makes a few mistakes in that regard, so let's take a peek.

11:50.100 --> 11:55.500
So, I wasn't surprised to learn that her character was also a far-left, open-borders advocate,

11:55.500 --> 11:58.500
which T'Challa shuts down without any further discussion.

11:58.500 --> 12:04.300
He points out, correctly, that if they let people in, Wakanda will change,

12:04.300 --> 12:08.300
which was a surprisingly woke defense of anti-immigration policies.

12:08.300 --> 12:12.300
So first off, this conversation between T'Challa and his sister Shuri,

12:12.300 --> 12:17.100
the supposed far-left, open-borders advocate, doesn't happen.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.900
The conversation in which T'Challa says he doesn't want to let in refugees

12:20.900 --> 12:26.100
actually takes place between him and Nakia, who is his love interest in the movie.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.700
And this isn't the only time Sargon mixes up these two characters.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.100
He elsewhere states,

12:48.100 --> 12:53.100
Now, is that true? I can't remember that scene happening, honestly.

12:53.100 --> 12:58.100
I remember a scene in which T'Challa talks about Nakia being a queen,

12:58.100 --> 13:03.100
because he's flirting with her, you know, if he marries her, she'll be the queen,

13:03.100 --> 13:05.100
but nothing about Shuri being the queen.

13:05.100 --> 13:10.100
I'm willing to admit being wrong here, you know, maybe my memory is on the fritz as well.

13:10.100 --> 13:15.100
But regardless, Carl uses the conversation between T'Challa and Nakia

13:15.100 --> 13:17.700
as his proof that T'Challa is alt-right.

13:17.700 --> 13:21.900
He also shares a picture of Black Panther in a Trump hat.

13:21.900 --> 13:27.900
So I think I can help Sargon out a little here with my interpretation of the narrative of the film.

13:27.900 --> 13:33.300
There are a few key early scenes in the movie that relate to Wakanda's governance.

13:33.300 --> 13:38.300
First off is T'Challa meeting the spirit of his father and saying he doesn't feel ready to lead

13:38.300 --> 13:40.100
and isn't sure what to do.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.700
And then his father's spirit says,

13:42.700 --> 13:47.700
And the next scene is T'Challa talking to his love interest, Nakia.

13:47.700 --> 13:51.700
He asks her what Wakanda should do, and she says,

13:56.700 --> 13:59.700
The next scene is T'Challa talking to his friend, Wakabi,

13:59.700 --> 14:02.700
who advises him not to let refugees in but says,

14:02.700 --> 14:06.700
hey, if you wanna go fuck some guys up, I'm down with that,

14:06.700 --> 14:10.700
to which T'Challa rebuffs him and says war is not our way.

14:10.700 --> 14:14.700
These scenes set up the core thematic conflict of the movie.

14:14.700 --> 14:18.700
You know, should Wakanda remain hidden or reveal itself to the world?

14:18.700 --> 14:22.700
And if it reveals itself, should that be done peacefully and diplomatically

14:22.700 --> 14:24.700
or in a violent conquest?

14:24.700 --> 14:29.700
T'Challa takes the opposite side in his conversations with both Wakabi and Nakia

14:29.700 --> 14:31.700
because he isn't sure what he should do.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.700
His first real test comes when Everett Ross gets shot.

14:35.700 --> 14:40.700
There's a conversation between Okoye, the partner of Wakabi, and Nakia,

14:40.700 --> 14:42.700
where they again debate the core conflict.

14:42.700 --> 14:46.700
Should we reveal Wakanda in order to help this outsider,

14:46.700 --> 14:48.700
or should we let it remain hidden?

14:48.700 --> 14:53.700
And T'Challa chooses to bring him to Wakanda in order to save his life.

14:53.700 --> 14:57.700
And then later in the story, we of course have the previously mentioned

14:57.700 --> 15:01.700
T'Challa shouting at his ancestors that they were wrong

15:01.700 --> 15:06.700
and finally using Wakanda's resources to help the world at the conclusion of the movie.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.700
So, is T'Challa alt-right?

15:09.700 --> 15:14.700
Well, only if being alt-right means abandoning those principles immediately

15:14.700 --> 15:18.700
in order to do the right thing at every available opportunity.

15:18.700 --> 15:23.700
T'Challa is hesitantly anti-immigration at the beginning of the film,

15:23.700 --> 15:28.700
but then things happen to him and he changes and by the end, he is not.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.700
It's the old Scrooge issue again.

15:31.700 --> 15:38.700
Sargon and Stefan and Paul are relaying only the initial representation of T'Challa and Wakanda

15:38.700 --> 15:40.700
and not the narrative as a whole.

15:40.700 --> 15:45.700
Now, the rest of Sargon's response is filled with similar blustery retellings

15:45.700 --> 15:48.700
of all the terrible things about Wakanda.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.700
You know, as if he's the only one who noticed them.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.700
And I'm not really sure who he's responding to.

15:54.700 --> 16:00.700
You can take a guess, though. Though it's a little convoluted to relay, so stick with me here.

16:00.700 --> 16:06.700
Sargon has seen people he calls SJWs excited about the Black Panther movie,

16:06.700 --> 16:08.700
as, indeed, a lot of people are.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.700
A big-budget movie with a predominantly black cast set in Africa,

16:12.700 --> 16:16.700
you know, it brings some diversity to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

16:16.700 --> 16:21.700
a lot of minorities and those on the left are glad to see the movie doing so well.

16:21.700 --> 16:26.700
But Sargon and other right-wingers see this enthusiasm about what the movie represents

16:26.700 --> 16:31.700
and misinterpret it to be uncritical and unquestioning enthusiasm

16:31.700 --> 16:34.700
for every aspect of every part of the movie.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.700
So when Sargon said,

16:36.700 --> 16:42.700
all these SJWs are excited to see a representation of a flawless black paradise.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.700
And then when he notices that Wakanda is not so,

16:45.700 --> 16:48.700
that it's actually a country with problems that need to be overcome,

16:48.700 --> 16:50.700
he treats that as a contradiction.

16:50.700 --> 16:56.700
You know, this movie isn't living up to my expectation of SJW expectations.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.700
Aha, I have caught it out.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.700
And Carl, you're off the mark, man.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.700
You know, people are just excited to see a black superhero movie.

17:04.700 --> 17:08.700
It doesn't mean they now support hereditary monarchies or something,

17:08.700 --> 17:10.700
just because there was one in the movie.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.700
I mean, I like Thor Ragnarok.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.700
That's got a hereditary monarchy in the movie.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.700
It doesn't mean I support it, though, does it?

17:17.700 --> 17:20.700
That was my Thor Ragnarok callback there.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.700
I bet you've forgotten about that.

17:22.700 --> 17:26.700
There's another one coming up in a few minutes as well, so be on the lookout.

17:26.700 --> 17:32.700
So to demonstrate that us loony SJW types can actually look at the movie critically,

17:32.700 --> 17:34.700
I guess I should give my opinions here.

17:34.700 --> 17:38.700
So I thought Black Panther was okay.

17:38.700 --> 17:42.700
It's probably my second favorite Marvel movie after Thor Ragnarok,

17:43.700 --> 17:47.700
though that is not a field with particularly stiff competition.

17:47.700 --> 17:51.700
Mostly exceedingly flaccid competition, actually.

17:51.700 --> 17:57.700
All the positive things about Black Panther were held back in part by the constraints of the medium.

17:57.700 --> 18:02.700
It is ultimately a comic book movie and comes with all the problems that that entails.

18:02.700 --> 18:09.700
You know, regardless of politics, you know the final confrontation is gonna be between two punch men punching each other

18:09.700 --> 18:12.700
until the good guy punches the best and wins.

18:12.700 --> 18:17.700
Now, Black Panther attempts to give the villain Killmonger some complexity.

18:17.700 --> 18:22.700
As much complexity as one can give a character called Killmonger, anyway.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.700
But it ultimately needs the audience to side with Black Panther,

18:25.700 --> 18:31.700
so it tempers that complexity with having Killmonger just do horrible things from time to time.

18:31.700 --> 18:37.700
And this good versus evil simplification bleeds into the wider conflict of the movie as well.

18:37.700 --> 18:42.700
Killmongers was the bad way to reveal Wakanda to the world, and T'Challa's is the good way.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.700
When, really, it's more complex than that.

18:45.700 --> 18:49.700
You know, what happens if T'Challa tries to give aid to a country and they refuse?

18:49.700 --> 18:53.700
Or if the government keeps all the aid for themselves while letting their people starve?

18:53.700 --> 18:57.700
You know, will he then intervene or just abandon those people?

18:57.700 --> 19:02.700
It's a pretty tough question, and the movie kinda rushes past this problem at the end there.

19:02.700 --> 19:06.700
But they have to save something for Black Panther 2, I guess.

19:06.700 --> 19:12.700
So, T'Challa's peaceful diplomatic aid outreach thing felt a little thin to me.

19:12.700 --> 19:18.700
Now, obviously, starting a race war as Killmonger wanted is hardly a perfect option either.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.700
But these two philosophies are not the only two that are available.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.700
But, again, it's a Marvel movie.

19:25.700 --> 19:31.700
The closer that Black Panther gets to real-world problems and situations, the duller its edge gets.

19:31.700 --> 19:35.700
You know, it's held back by its proximity to reality, I guess.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.700
There's almost no white racism in the movie, for instance.

19:38.700 --> 19:41.700
And for a movie that references colonialism a bunch,

19:41.700 --> 19:46.700
having the conflict be between a black man and his cousin within a royal family at that,

19:46.700 --> 19:49.700
it felt like an imposed half-measure.

19:49.700 --> 19:54.700
You know, they want this movie to sell to white audiences too, clearly.

19:54.700 --> 20:00.700
The more direct colonialist story would be the world finding out about Wakanda's vibranium deposits

20:00.700 --> 20:04.700
and invading it to plunder them, and having Wakanda have to fight back.

20:04.700 --> 20:08.700
But that story would be a little embarrassing, I imagine.

20:08.700 --> 20:12.700
This is partly why I prefer Thor Ragnarok to Black Panther,

20:12.700 --> 20:16.700
because the Thor movie, being set in a fictional space empire,

20:16.700 --> 20:19.700
has a lot more freedom to go where the story needs to.

20:19.700 --> 20:25.700
You can have Thor recognize that colonialist Asgard needs to be destroyed,

20:25.700 --> 20:29.700
and doing it, and setting out to create a better society,

20:29.700 --> 20:34.700
but you can't have Wakanda being invaded by a real country that actually exists on Earth,

20:34.700 --> 20:36.700
and then have Wakanda destroy it.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.700
Though that is fun to imagine.

20:39.700 --> 20:45.700
The one other criticism I have of Black Panther is one I also have for Thor Ragnarok,

20:45.700 --> 20:49.700
that it doesn't drop the hereditary monarchy at the end of the movie.

20:49.700 --> 20:56.700
Looking at this list again, the one and only point that remains true by the end of the movie is anti-democracy.

20:56.700 --> 21:00.700
Now, the movie does communicate that absolute monarchy is a bad thing.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.700
It means someone like Killmonger can usurp the throne,

21:03.700 --> 21:08.700
and Okoye turning on King Killmonger is presented heroically, for instance.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.700
But I'd have preferred a more direct condemnation

21:11.700 --> 21:15.700
for the less discerning viewers in the audience, shall we say.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.700
You know, a little tacked-on conversation at the end.

21:18.700 --> 21:22.700
By the way, that Killmonger thing sucked. We should probably have elections instead.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.700
You know, that wouldn't have been hard to do.

21:25.700 --> 21:29.700
If I were making the sequel, that would probably be the first plot point.

21:29.700 --> 21:33.700
All that said, I still enjoyed Black Panther, and I'm excited about it,

21:33.700 --> 21:36.700
particularly in a sign-of-things-to-come type fashion.

21:36.700 --> 21:42.700
The more that Hollywood gets used to the idea that it does not only need to tell white stories,

21:42.700 --> 21:45.700
the more stories we'll all have to enjoy.

21:45.700 --> 21:46.700
And isn't that neat?

21:46.700 --> 21:50.700
And I guess at the conclusion here, I should return and answer the opening question.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.700
Is Black Panther alt-right?

21:53.700 --> 21:56.700
No.

22:23.700 --> 22:26.700
All of whom are brilliant.

22:26.700 --> 22:28.700
Head over there and check it out, if you like.

22:28.700 --> 22:32.700
And also follow me on Twitter or send me a question on Curious Cat.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.700
I will put the links below.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.700
Thanks a lot, folks. I'll see you next time.
