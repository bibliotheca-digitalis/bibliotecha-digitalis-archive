0	9500	So I decided to watch another CinemaSins video, um, because apparently I hate myself and my time is worthless.
9500	25000	So the first video I watched was everything wrong with The Jungle Book, and to be honest, watching these guys do their shtick about a children's animated film, um, that kind of made me a little irrationally angry.
25000	31000	Also, the movie suggests panthers and wolves are good buddies and not enemies or competitors for the same food sources as logic would dictate.
31000	42000	Oh, really? Are the singing, dancing, cartoon animals in the children's fantasy film, are they not behaving realistically, CinemaSins?
42000	46000	And here's me thinking I was watching a nature documentary.
46000	53000	Thank you, CinemaSins, for pointing out the logical inconsistencies of the talking animals.
54000	56000	Oh, Jesus Christ.
56000	62000	And that was about all that I could handle of that, so, uh, I did Empire Strikes Back instead.
62000	67000	As we're about to see, the Empire is going to get their asses kicked yet again, with Luke Skywalker leading the charge.
67000	72000	So at what point exactly are the Empire supposed to get their asses kicked in this movie?
73000	85000	They destroy the hidden rebel base, they capture the Falcon and its crew, and then Luke loses in the duel against Darth Vader, gets his hand cut off, and nearly dies.
85000	92000	Sometimes I wonder if CinemaSins actually watched the full movie before they start coming up with sins for it.
92000	97000	I mean, come on, the clue is kinda in the title with this one, guys.
97000	102000	Okay, so this is a remote ice planet, I'm assuming where no one really lived before, because it's colder than fuck.
102000	106000	But the rebels came here and then found, tamed, and learned how to ride the indigenous Tauntauns?
106000	109000	And built a whole base inside the mountain in three years?
109000	114000	So there's nothing in the movie to say that the rebels are the ones who domesticated the Tauntauns.
114000	118000	There's not even anything in the movie to say that Tauntauns are indigenous to Hoth.
118000	126000	I mean, maybe they are, but maybe the rebels brought a shipment of them when they knew they were gonna go to an icy planet and could use them to ride around on.
127000	131000	Also, the rebel base isn't that complicated to be completed in three years.
131000	138000	I mean, three years is a long time, and it mainly just seems to be naturally-occurring caverns in the ice.
138000	141000	All the rebels have done is tunnel between them.
141000	147000	And remember, this is a universe in which the Empire can crank out a new Death Star whenever they feel like it,
147000	152000	so I'm not sure that the rebels building a base in three years is really that unbelievable.
152000	159000	Holy shit. Who would've guessed that of all three movies, including the one where she wears a bikini, that this would be the sexiest Leia moment of all?
159000	164000	Good job managing to sexualize a woman silently looking across a room.
164000	169000	I'm starting to think CinemaSins has a bit of a problem with women.
174000	178000	First off, Han refers to some other adventure we have no context for unless we read the f***ing books.
178000	183000	Second off, Han decides it's time to go because he ran into a bounty hunter on some other planet who obviously doesn't know where he is now.
183000	184000	It's been three years.
184000	191000	No, Han ran into a bounty hunter, and now he's concerned about more bounty hunters coming after him in the future.
191000	196000	So he wants to leave to pay off Jabba the Hutt to stop that from happening again.
196000	204000	He's not worried about just that one specific bounty hunter, he's worried about any possible future bounty hunters.
204000	209000	This scene is also re-establishing for the audience that Han has a bounty on his head.
209000	214000	And of course, later on in the film, Han is actually captured by a bounty hunter.
214000	217000	So it's not as though his fears were unfounded here.
224000	231000	The tension in these scenes comes from the fact that the rebels have to close their shield doors before it gets too cold.
234000	235000	Let's be closed.
237000	238000	Close the doors.
238000	239000	Yes, sir.
239000	247000	If it were true that everything else worked regardless of cold, then the rebels wouldn't care if they had to close the doors or not, and this tension wouldn't exist.
247000	251000	Hungry Wampa decided to knock out Luke and put him in the fridge before eating him.
251000	257000	The shots of the Wampa show it eating the taunt on before Luke, it's saving Luke for later.
257000	259000	I get what you're going for here, I really do.
259000	264000	In the last movie, you showed me this asshole using the Force while blind to deflect unseen laser blasts from a drone.
264000	266000	How can he do that, but not this?
266000	269000	He can do it, you can tell because he does it.
269000	271000	It's just not easy.
271000	280000	We've never seen Luke use the Force to move anything with his mind before, so this is introducing that concept to the audience.
280000	285000	If Luke just started moving things about with his mind with no effort, it'd be really confusing.
286000	291000	So, Luke left the Beast's cave, fell unconscious for a bit, but then woke back up and started walking again? Really?
291000	292000	Really?
292000	296000	Uh, no. That doesn't happen in the movie.
296000	301000	If you watch the full shot, you see Luke trip and fall into the shot.
301000	306000	All that happened is that he fell over and stood back up, at no point was he unconscious.
306000	312000	CinemaSins just cut out the trip and then pretended that Luke was waking up from being unconscious.
313000	317000	This asshole only shows up in the absolute most extreme Luke might die situations.
317000	327000	Extreme situations like sitting around having a chat with Yoda and at a party with a bunch of Ewoks.
327000	331000	Luke's not really in any danger in either of those situations.
331000	337000	I still say that in all the Star Wars movies, the most unbelievable thing is that Han somehow finds Luke during dusk on a huge snow planet.
338000	341000	Why does Han have to search the entire planet to find Luke?
341000	349000	He knows where Luke was before he went missing, and that's where Luke got attacked, so we can assume he's close to there.
349000	356000	We see R2 looking for Luke on a scanner, so we can therefore assume Luke can be picked up by scanners.
356000	362000	And who knows? Maybe Han decided to take a scanner with him, and that's how he found Luke.
367000	376000	Tauntaun X Machina
376000	382000	So is it just me, or does CinemaSins not actually know what the phrase Deus Ex Machina means?
382000	390000	It actually means some sort of plot contrivance that resolves a lot of conflicts, seemingly arbitrarily.
390000	394000	It usually comes at the end of a play or a film or whatever.
394000	401000	The Tauntaun dying here actually complicates the plot, because Han can't use it to get home.
401000	409000	So what the hell? I think CinemaSins think Deus Ex Machina means something happened.
409000	411000	Probably it'll keep you warm.
411000	415000	How does Han stuff Luke into a Tauntaun belly? They're not much bigger than humans.
416000	422000	They're huge. They're like fucking ten feet tall. Look at the size of it.
424000	428000	Han somehow survives the bitter cold all through the night without getting inside the Tauntaun himself.
428000	432000	That sounded dirty, but Han should be frozen much like Luke was a minute ago.
432000	437000	Yeah, Han somehow survives the bitter cold. It's an absolute mystery.
438000	448000	Maybe he set up a camp. But that's a guess. There's nothing in the actual movie to say that Han set up a camp to survive the night.
448000	454000	If you're really stretching, at the end of that scene it looks a bit like he's starting to set up a camp.
454000	458000	And then when the airspeeder finds him, it looks like he's set up a camp.
458000	464000	In the previous shot, Han has a line of dialogue.
465000	467000	Probably it'll keep you warm.
467000	469000	Until I get the shelter up.
471000	475000	You know, other than all of that, who knows what he did.
475000	476000	It's metal.
476000	478000	Then it couldn't be one of those creatures.
478000	479000	Could be a speeder, one of ours.
479000	482000	You mean the speeders who were just told last night can't go out in the cold?
482000	493000	Yeah, Han was told that last night. And last night it was colder than it is right now, which is a scene set during the daytime.
493000	499000	The rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed too close to the system.
499000	502000	Why didn't Vader specifically leave in order not to do that?
502000	509000	Yeah, Vader's not really the micromanaging type. He's more the, if you fuck up I'll choke you to death type.
509000	514000	So you can land these things outside the energy shield, but you can't get some quick fighters down here to perform an aerial assault.
514000	520000	Yeah, why does the Empire only use ground forces here and not use any aerial forces?
520000	525000	Comscan has detected an energy field protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system.
525000	527000	The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.
527000	533000	We've already been told that the rebels have to drop the shield to allow their own ships to pass through it.
533000	538000	The energy shield can only be open for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transport.
538000	545000	The reason that the Empire can't use any ships is because no ships can pass through the rebels' energy shield.
545000	552000	The goal of the ground forces of the Empire in this scene is to destroy the shield generator,
552000	556000	get the shields down so that the Empire can invade the base and take it over.
560000	561000	Luke survives this crash.
561000	566000	Why wouldn't he survive that crash? It doesn't even look like he was going very fast.
566000	569000	This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
569000	573000	That's kind of true, but why was Luke's X-wing somehow able to get through the blockade no problem?
573000	576000	Luke's X-wing isn't damaged.
576000	582000	The Millennium Falcon's hyperdrive is broken, which is why they have so much trouble getting away from the blockade.
582000	586000	Here's another thing. How are there not any Imperial ships guarding the exit off the planet?
586000	589000	We even heard them talk about a blockade earlier, so where is it?
589000	593000	And the rebels didn't find some other side of the planet where the blockade wouldn't affect them, so what gives?
593000	596000	There are Imperial ships guarding the exit off the planet.
596000	600000	You even featured them in a previous sin in your video.
600000	603000	Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.
603000	611000	The big rebel cannon is disabling the ships to allow the rebel freighters and fighters to get through the blockade.
611000	613000	Two fighters against a star destroyer.
613000	619000	The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path.
620000	632000	If you'd watched the movie with your eyes and registered the information with your brain, you'd know this.
632000	635000	Two of these three star destroyers pursuing the Falcon run into each other.
635000	639000	How is that possible? How do you not see another star destroyer in your path?
639000	641000	Do you not have radar training skill?
641000	652000	So in the previous clip, CinemaSins gave the movie a sin for not featuring any of the Imperial ships supposedly guarding the exit off the planet.
652000	661000	And in this one, which is the next sin in their video, remember, they give it a sin for having so many Imperial ships that they're all running into each other.
662000	667000	Who's flying the ship right now? Leia? Autopilot Evasion Software?
667000	678000	There is this shot when Han returns to the cockpit showing Leia sitting in the pilot's seat with her hands on the controls, but who knows?
680000	683000	Like an asteroid? How does an asteroid hit you when you're not dead yet?
683000	689000	Maybe if it hits you when you're in a science fiction spaceship with a deflector shield?
692000	695000	No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
695000	698000	But he just said what was wrong with the hyperdrive a few minutes ago, didn't he?
698000	701000	I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
701000	706000	And you didn't fix it because you hit the asteroid field before you could do anything. So that's still the problem, right?
706000	709000	No, all he said was that the motivator was damaged.
709000	716000	There could be a hundred different ways in which it's damaged, and Han needs 3PO to find out which one of those ways it is.
717000	723000	And actually, later on, C-3PO gives more information about the way in which the hyperdrive is damaged.
723000	729000	I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid we'll have to replace it.
729000	731000	You seek Yoda.
731000	733000	You know him?
733000	736000	Take it to him, I will.
736000	742000	Just like Obi-Wan, Yoda initially pretends not to be the person he actually is, mostly just to f*** with the audience. I mean Luke.
742000	748000	He's not f***ing with Luke. He's testing his patience to see if he's suitable to be trained.
748000	751000	Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here! We're wasting our time!
753000	758000	I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
758000	765000	I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.
765000	768000	Which is a weird thing to say to Anakin Skywalker.
768000	772000	He's not talking to Anakin Skywalker, he's talking to Darth Vader.
772000	779000	And yes, there is a difference between those two things, and if you don't understand that, you just don't understand Star Wars.
787000	797000	So this is a weird one. CinemaSins is complaining that the Emperor and Vader don't know that Luke Skywalker is Anakin Skywalker's son.
797000	805000	Even though this is the scene where they reveal that they do know that Luke Skywalker is Anakin Skywalker's son.
805000	812000	I mean, we know that they know his name because in an earlier scene Vader calls him Skywalker.
812000	817000	And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system.
817000	824000	So why is CinemaSins saying that the Emperor and Vader weren't tipped off to that fact?
824000	829000	Because they clearly were. Otherwise they wouldn't currently be talking about it.
839000	849000	Yoda is reluctant to train Luke because he thinks he's too impatient and will fall to the dark side like his father did.
849000	859000	I mean, this is very basic information revealed through the dialogue directly. So I can understand how CinemaSins managed to miss it.
859000	864000	Okay, so after this big talk about how rocks and spaceships are different from each other and size doesn't matter and all that jazz,
864000	868000	Yoda then proceeds to power the ship out of the water. But with considerable effort I might add,
868000	873000	if the force supposedly doesn't distinguish the size of objects, this thing should have emerged immediately.
873000	878000	Yoda isn't just trying to get the ship out of the water in this scene.
878000	887000	He's using the opportunity afforded by the ship sinking to teach Luke about what's possible through use of the force
887000	891000	and believing in yourself and your own abilities.
891000	900000	Luke doesn't believe that this is possible, and then Yoda shows him in a very impressive display of power that it is possible.
900000	908000	He's not just literally trying to get the ship out of the swamp. That's not the point of the scene.
908000	914000	Also I don't know where CinemaSins got the idea that this takes considerable effort for Yoda
914000	920000	because at no point in the scene does it look like he's struggling or having any trouble with what he's doing.
920000	924000	He's just doing it in a very slow and deliberate manner.
924000	933000	If you leave now, help them you could, but you will destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
933000	937000	Because your dad is Darth Vader and he can turn you to the dark side and the rebels would lose the war.
937000	941000	But that's a spoiler for the audience that you, the most important character in this movie, is just better off not knowing.
941000	946000	They're not withholding this information from Luke for a big surprise or something.
946000	949000	They think he's better off not knowing it.
949000	955000	They want him to kill Vader and they think that if they tell Luke Vader is his father,
955000	960000	he'll be less likely to want to kill him, which is exactly what happens.
960000	964000	So they kind of had a point in not telling Luke that information.
964000	967000	I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
967000	972000	How did they do that? Even if Boba Fett tells Vader that they're going to Cloud City immediately after he starts following the Falcon,
972000	976000	the Falcon has a huge head start and this is after the Star Destroyers went into light speed in a different direction.
976000	984000	Okay, so the fact that the Falcon's hyperdrive is broken is one of the major plot threads in the film and it's impossible to miss.
984000	989000	And I know that CinemaSins didn't miss it because they refer to it in previous sins.
989000	992000	So how did they forget it here?
992000	1000000	They're like, how could the Empire possibly get to Cloud City before the ship with a damaged engine?
1000000	1008000	I mean, the only reason that the Falcon went to Cloud City anyway was to get the hyperdrive fixed.
1008000	1011000	Put it together, guys. For fuck's sake.
1011000	1022000	This contraption does things so horrible it's better left off screen because whatever bullshit that thing is doing is probably bullshit, but it sure does hurt.
1022000	1034000	No, leaving the torture off screen and its exact nature unspecific makes it even more horrible in the minds of the audience than if they just showed it directly.
1034000	1040000	But leaving that aside for a second, why does CinemaSins beep out their own swear words?
1040000	1050000	I mean, they don't record these live. They could write the script to say whatever they want, but they put in swear words only to later beep them out again.
1050000	1052000	What's going on there?
1052000	1053000	Walt Disney.
1053000	1059000	Walt Disney wasn't cryogenically frozen. That's just an urban legend. He was cremated.
1059000	1061000	There you go. You learn something new every day.
1061000	1063000	Just try it out.
1063000	1065000	We don't need any of your help.
1065000	1070000	Really? Like, the kind that just freed you from captivity so you could escape? You don't need that kind of help?
1070000	1074000	The last time that Lando said he was going to help them, he led them into a trap.
1074000	1081000	So they're reluctant to take his help this time because they don't know if his offer to help them is genuine or if he's lying again.
1081000	1085000	Rest of the good guys running directly by random spot R2D2 just happen to wind up cliché.
1085000	1094000	Rest of the good guys running directly by random spot R2D2 just happen to wind up cliché.
1094000	1100000	What the fuck is that? I don't think they know what cliché means either.
1100000	1107000	How many times does that happen? This is the second film that came out in the Star Wars franchise, remember.
1107000	1112000	So how many opportunities has that thing had to happen even?
1113000	1115000	What the fuck?
1122000	1128000	He doesn't do more of it because he doesn't have to. Vader's not trying to kill Luke in this scene.
1128000	1133000	He could completely cut his head off whenever he wanted to if he was trying to kill Luke.
1133000	1137000	He's trying to wear him down and make him join his side.
1138000	1147000	Luke can't beat Vader and he doesn't want to join him, so letting go and just falling off the thing is actually the noble choice here.
1157000	1163000	Oh yeah, they never showed us any of these ships running the Imperial blockade before, did they?
1163000	1168000	Say, for instance, this ship. See this ship right here.
1168000	1174000	Who remembers a scene earlier in the film showing that running the blockade?
1174000	1180000	Not me. I don't remember that. When did that happen?
1193000	1197000	Thanks for watching!
