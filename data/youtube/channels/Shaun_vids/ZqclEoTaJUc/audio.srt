1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
So I decided to watch another CinemaSins video, um, because apparently I hate myself and my time is worthless.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:25,000
So the first video I watched was everything wrong with The Jungle Book, and to be honest, watching these guys do their shtick about a children's animated film, um, that kind of made me a little irrationally angry.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Also, the movie suggests panthers and wolves are good buddies and not enemies or competitors for the same food sources as logic would dictate.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, really? Are the singing, dancing, cartoon animals in the children's fantasy film, are they not behaving realistically, CinemaSins?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And here's me thinking I was watching a nature documentary.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Thank you, CinemaSins, for pointing out the logical inconsistencies of the talking animals.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And that was about all that I could handle of that, so, uh, I did Empire Strikes Back instead.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
As we're about to see, the Empire is going to get their asses kicked yet again, with Luke Skywalker leading the charge.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So at what point exactly are the Empire supposed to get their asses kicked in this movie?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They destroy the hidden rebel base, they capture the Falcon and its crew, and then Luke loses in the duel against Darth Vader, gets his hand cut off, and nearly dies.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Sometimes I wonder if CinemaSins actually watched the full movie before they start coming up with sins for it.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I mean, come on, the clue is kinda in the title with this one, guys.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay, so this is a remote ice planet, I'm assuming where no one really lived before, because it's colder than fuck.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But the rebels came here and then found, tamed, and learned how to ride the indigenous Tauntauns?

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And built a whole base inside the mountain in three years?

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So there's nothing in the movie to say that the rebels are the ones who domesticated the Tauntauns.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There's not even anything in the movie to say that Tauntauns are indigenous to Hoth.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I mean, maybe they are, but maybe the rebels brought a shipment of them when they knew they were gonna go to an icy planet and could use them to ride around on.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Also, the rebel base isn't that complicated to be completed in three years.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I mean, three years is a long time, and it mainly just seems to be naturally-occurring caverns in the ice.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All the rebels have done is tunnel between them.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And remember, this is a universe in which the Empire can crank out a new Death Star whenever they feel like it,

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
so I'm not sure that the rebels building a base in three years is really that unbelievable.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Holy shit. Who would've guessed that of all three movies, including the one where she wears a bikini, that this would be the sexiest Leia moment of all?

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Good job managing to sexualize a woman silently looking across a room.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm starting to think CinemaSins has a bit of a problem with women.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
First off, Han refers to some other adventure we have no context for unless we read the f***ing books.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Second off, Han decides it's time to go because he ran into a bounty hunter on some other planet who obviously doesn't know where he is now.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's been three years.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, Han ran into a bounty hunter, and now he's concerned about more bounty hunters coming after him in the future.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So he wants to leave to pay off Jabba the Hutt to stop that from happening again.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's not worried about just that one specific bounty hunter, he's worried about any possible future bounty hunters.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This scene is also re-establishing for the audience that Han has a bounty on his head.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And of course, later on in the film, Han is actually captured by a bounty hunter.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So it's not as though his fears were unfounded here.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The tension in these scenes comes from the fact that the rebels have to close their shield doors before it gets too cold.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's be closed.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Close the doors.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If it were true that everything else worked regardless of cold, then the rebels wouldn't care if they had to close the doors or not, and this tension wouldn't exist.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hungry Wampa decided to knock out Luke and put him in the fridge before eating him.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The shots of the Wampa show it eating the taunt on before Luke, it's saving Luke for later.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I get what you're going for here, I really do.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In the last movie, you showed me this asshole using the Force while blind to deflect unseen laser blasts from a drone.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How can he do that, but not this?

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He can do it, you can tell because he does it.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's just not easy.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We've never seen Luke use the Force to move anything with his mind before, so this is introducing that concept to the audience.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If Luke just started moving things about with his mind with no effort, it'd be really confusing.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So, Luke left the Beast's cave, fell unconscious for a bit, but then woke back up and started walking again? Really?

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Uh, no. That doesn't happen in the movie.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you watch the full shot, you see Luke trip and fall into the shot.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
All that happened is that he fell over and stood back up, at no point was he unconscious.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
CinemaSins just cut out the trip and then pretended that Luke was waking up from being unconscious.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This asshole only shows up in the absolute most extreme Luke might die situations.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Extreme situations like sitting around having a chat with Yoda and at a party with a bunch of Ewoks.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Luke's not really in any danger in either of those situations.

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I still say that in all the Star Wars movies, the most unbelievable thing is that Han somehow finds Luke during dusk on a huge snow planet.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why does Han have to search the entire planet to find Luke?

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He knows where Luke was before he went missing, and that's where Luke got attacked, so we can assume he's close to there.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We see R2 looking for Luke on a scanner, so we can therefore assume Luke can be picked up by scanners.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And who knows? Maybe Han decided to take a scanner with him, and that's how he found Luke.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Tauntaun X Machina

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So is it just me, or does CinemaSins not actually know what the phrase Deus Ex Machina means?

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It actually means some sort of plot contrivance that resolves a lot of conflicts, seemingly arbitrarily.

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It usually comes at the end of a play or a film or whatever.

69
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The Tauntaun dying here actually complicates the plot, because Han can't use it to get home.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So what the hell? I think CinemaSins think Deus Ex Machina means something happened.

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Probably it'll keep you warm.

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How does Han stuff Luke into a Tauntaun belly? They're not much bigger than humans.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They're huge. They're like fucking ten feet tall. Look at the size of it.

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Han somehow survives the bitter cold all through the night without getting inside the Tauntaun himself.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That sounded dirty, but Han should be frozen much like Luke was a minute ago.

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah, Han somehow survives the bitter cold. It's an absolute mystery.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Maybe he set up a camp. But that's a guess. There's nothing in the actual movie to say that Han set up a camp to survive the night.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If you're really stretching, at the end of that scene it looks a bit like he's starting to set up a camp.

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then when the airspeeder finds him, it looks like he's set up a camp.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
In the previous shot, Han has a line of dialogue.

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Probably it'll keep you warm.

82
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Until I get the shelter up.

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You know, other than all of that, who knows what he did.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's metal.

85
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Then it couldn't be one of those creatures.

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Could be a speeder, one of ours.

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You mean the speeders who were just told last night can't go out in the cold?

88
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, Han was told that last night. And last night it was colder than it is right now, which is a scene set during the daytime.

89
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed too close to the system.

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Why didn't Vader specifically leave in order not to do that?

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah, Vader's not really the micromanaging type. He's more the, if you fuck up I'll choke you to death type.

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So you can land these things outside the energy shield, but you can't get some quick fighters down here to perform an aerial assault.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, why does the Empire only use ground forces here and not use any aerial forces?

94
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Comscan has detected an energy field protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system.

95
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We've already been told that the rebels have to drop the shield to allow their own ships to pass through it.

97
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The energy shield can only be open for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transport.

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The reason that the Empire can't use any ships is because no ships can pass through the rebels' energy shield.

99
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The goal of the ground forces of the Empire in this scene is to destroy the shield generator,

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
get the shields down so that the Empire can invade the base and take it over.

101
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Luke survives this crash.

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why wouldn't he survive that crash? It doesn't even look like he was going very fast.

103
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.

104
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's kind of true, but why was Luke's X-wing somehow able to get through the blockade no problem?

105
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Luke's X-wing isn't damaged.

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The Millennium Falcon's hyperdrive is broken, which is why they have so much trouble getting away from the blockade.

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Here's another thing. How are there not any Imperial ships guarding the exit off the planet?

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We even heard them talk about a blockade earlier, so where is it?

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And the rebels didn't find some other side of the planet where the blockade wouldn't affect them, so what gives?

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There are Imperial ships guarding the exit off the planet.

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You even featured them in a previous sin in your video.

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The big rebel cannon is disabling the ships to allow the rebel freighters and fighters to get through the blockade.

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Two fighters against a star destroyer.

115
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path.

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you'd watched the movie with your eyes and registered the information with your brain, you'd know this.

117
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Two of these three star destroyers pursuing the Falcon run into each other.

118
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
How is that possible? How do you not see another star destroyer in your path?

119
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you not have radar training skill?

120
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So in the previous clip, CinemaSins gave the movie a sin for not featuring any of the Imperial ships supposedly guarding the exit off the planet.

121
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And in this one, which is the next sin in their video, remember, they give it a sin for having so many Imperial ships that they're all running into each other.

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Who's flying the ship right now? Leia? Autopilot Evasion Software?

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There is this shot when Han returns to the cockpit showing Leia sitting in the pilot's seat with her hands on the controls, but who knows?

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Like an asteroid? How does an asteroid hit you when you're not dead yet?

125
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Maybe if it hits you when you're in a science fiction spaceship with a deflector shield?

126
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.

127
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But he just said what was wrong with the hyperdrive a few minutes ago, didn't he?

128
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.

129
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And you didn't fix it because you hit the asteroid field before you could do anything. So that's still the problem, right?

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No, all he said was that the motivator was damaged.

131
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There could be a hundred different ways in which it's damaged, and Han needs 3PO to find out which one of those ways it is.

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And actually, later on, C-3PO gives more information about the way in which the hyperdrive is damaged.

133
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid we'll have to replace it.

134
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You seek Yoda.

135
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You know him?

136
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Take it to him, I will.

137
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Just like Obi-Wan, Yoda initially pretends not to be the person he actually is, mostly just to f*** with the audience. I mean Luke.

138
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He's not f***ing with Luke. He's testing his patience to see if he's suitable to be trained.

139
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here! We're wasting our time!

140
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.

141
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Which is a weird thing to say to Anakin Skywalker.

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He's not talking to Anakin Skywalker, he's talking to Darth Vader.

144
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And yes, there is a difference between those two things, and if you don't understand that, you just don't understand Star Wars.

145
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So this is a weird one. CinemaSins is complaining that the Emperor and Vader don't know that Luke Skywalker is Anakin Skywalker's son.

146
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Even though this is the scene where they reveal that they do know that Luke Skywalker is Anakin Skywalker's son.

147
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I mean, we know that they know his name because in an earlier scene Vader calls him Skywalker.

148
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system.

149
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So why is CinemaSins saying that the Emperor and Vader weren't tipped off to that fact?

150
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Because they clearly were. Otherwise they wouldn't currently be talking about it.

151
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yoda is reluctant to train Luke because he thinks he's too impatient and will fall to the dark side like his father did.

152
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I mean, this is very basic information revealed through the dialogue directly. So I can understand how CinemaSins managed to miss it.

153
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay, so after this big talk about how rocks and spaceships are different from each other and size doesn't matter and all that jazz,

154
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yoda then proceeds to power the ship out of the water. But with considerable effort I might add,

155
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
if the force supposedly doesn't distinguish the size of objects, this thing should have emerged immediately.

156
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yoda isn't just trying to get the ship out of the water in this scene.

157
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He's using the opportunity afforded by the ship sinking to teach Luke about what's possible through use of the force

158
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and believing in yourself and your own abilities.

159
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Luke doesn't believe that this is possible, and then Yoda shows him in a very impressive display of power that it is possible.

160
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He's not just literally trying to get the ship out of the swamp. That's not the point of the scene.

161
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Also I don't know where CinemaSins got the idea that this takes considerable effort for Yoda

162
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
because at no point in the scene does it look like he's struggling or having any trouble with what he's doing.

163
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He's just doing it in a very slow and deliberate manner.

164
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If you leave now, help them you could, but you will destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.

165
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Because your dad is Darth Vader and he can turn you to the dark side and the rebels would lose the war.

166
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But that's a spoiler for the audience that you, the most important character in this movie, is just better off not knowing.

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They're not withholding this information from Luke for a big surprise or something.

168
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They think he's better off not knowing it.

169
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They want him to kill Vader and they think that if they tell Luke Vader is his father,

170
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
he'll be less likely to want to kill him, which is exactly what happens.

171
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So they kind of had a point in not telling Luke that information.

172
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.

173
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
How did they do that? Even if Boba Fett tells Vader that they're going to Cloud City immediately after he starts following the Falcon,

174
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
the Falcon has a huge head start and this is after the Star Destroyers went into light speed in a different direction.

175
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay, so the fact that the Falcon's hyperdrive is broken is one of the major plot threads in the film and it's impossible to miss.

176
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And I know that CinemaSins didn't miss it because they refer to it in previous sins.

177
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So how did they forget it here?

178
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
They're like, how could the Empire possibly get to Cloud City before the ship with a damaged engine?

179
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I mean, the only reason that the Falcon went to Cloud City anyway was to get the hyperdrive fixed.

180
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Put it together, guys. For fuck's sake.

181
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:02,000
This contraption does things so horrible it's better left off screen because whatever bullshit that thing is doing is probably bullshit, but it sure does hurt.

182
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No, leaving the torture off screen and its exact nature unspecific makes it even more horrible in the minds of the audience than if they just showed it directly.

183
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But leaving that aside for a second, why does CinemaSins beep out their own swear words?

184
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I mean, they don't record these live. They could write the script to say whatever they want, but they put in swear words only to later beep them out again.

185
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What's going on there?

186
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Walt Disney.

187
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Walt Disney wasn't cryogenically frozen. That's just an urban legend. He was cremated.

188
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
There you go. You learn something new every day.

189
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Just try it out.

190
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We don't need any of your help.

191
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Really? Like, the kind that just freed you from captivity so you could escape? You don't need that kind of help?

192
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The last time that Lando said he was going to help them, he led them into a trap.

193
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So they're reluctant to take his help this time because they don't know if his offer to help them is genuine or if he's lying again.

194
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Rest of the good guys running directly by random spot R2D2 just happen to wind up cliché.

195
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Rest of the good guys running directly by random spot R2D2 just happen to wind up cliché.

196
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What the fuck is that? I don't think they know what cliché means either.

197
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
How many times does that happen? This is the second film that came out in the Star Wars franchise, remember.

198
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So how many opportunities has that thing had to happen even?

199
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What the fuck?

200
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
He doesn't do more of it because he doesn't have to. Vader's not trying to kill Luke in this scene.

201
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He could completely cut his head off whenever he wanted to if he was trying to kill Luke.

202
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
He's trying to wear him down and make him join his side.

203
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Luke can't beat Vader and he doesn't want to join him, so letting go and just falling off the thing is actually the noble choice here.

204
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh yeah, they never showed us any of these ships running the Imperial blockade before, did they?

205
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Say, for instance, this ship. See this ship right here.

206
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Who remembers a scene earlier in the film showing that running the blockade?

207
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Not me. I don't remember that. When did that happen?

208
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Thanks for watching!
