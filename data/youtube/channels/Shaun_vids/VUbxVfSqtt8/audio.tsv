0	1280	Hello, everyone.
1280	6880	Before we get to our main topic today, I want to talk very briefly about marathon running.
6880	14000	So, way back in 1985, science journal Nature published an article predicting that by the year 2000,
14000	18560	women would be consistently running faster marathon times than men.
18560	21120	Now, what led them to make this prediction?
21120	23200	Well, it was the data they had.
23200	26480	They saw that men's marathon times had hit a plateau,
26480	30640	and the record time was increasing only very slowly and by very small amounts.
30640	34240	The women's record time, on the other hand, was increasing much faster.
34240	38080	So by extrapolating out the very slow growth of the men's record time
38080	41360	and the relatively fast growth of the women's record time,
41360	46400	they predicted that women would catch up to and pass men within a decade or two.
46400	49360	Now then, they made a mistake, didn't they?
49360	52640	One which got them not a small amount of impolite mocking.
53360	54240	And what was that?
54240	58480	Well, by just extrapolating the current data trends into the future,
58480	63200	you'd fairly quickly have women running the marathon faster than the speed of sound,
63200	66080	which is probably highly unlikely.
66720	70240	Where Nature went wrong was not considering any other factors
70240	73360	which might have an effect on those data trends in the future.
73360	76880	For example, women hitting the same plateau as the men did,
76880	78880	which is, of course, what happened, you know?
79520	81680	Women's times had been increasing quickly
81680	84800	because not as many women were participating as men.
84800	87440	Women's sports science wasn't as advanced as men's,
87440	91920	but as women caught up to the men's times, those trends changed, obviously.
92480	97520	So why am I talking about this blunder by a science journal in 1985?
97520	102560	Well, I just want to highlight the danger of projecting current short-term data trends
102560	104080	decades into the future.
104640	105600	For example,
105600	108800	Will birth rates among poorer immigrant populations
108800	112240	remain the same several generations down the line?
112880	115840	It's something to think about and keep in mind.
116960	120080	So then, what's the actual topic of my video today?
120080	124640	Well, it's a recent video uploaded by Lauren Southern called The Great Replacement,
124640	126720	and let's watch the introduction to that.
126720	127440	Hey, everyone.
127440	130960	Okay, so today we are going to be talking about a very serious subject,
130960	134880	something that I think a lot of people are too afraid to talk about
134960	137760	because they're worried about being called a bigot
137760	141360	by both the people on the left and the right, surprisingly.
141360	144400	So in order to avoid people trying to discredit this video
144400	149120	with name-calling of Nazi or propagandists or other such nonsense,
149120	152800	it's going to be a very data-based video for the first bit.
152800	154560	Yay, data analysis.
154560	155040	That's me.
155600	159120	I have a little alarm that goes off when someone says data on YouTube.
160320	164560	So that intro there had a few of the regular white nationalist rhetorical tricks
164560	165360	you see online.
165920	167360	Lots of people agree with us.
167920	170400	They're all just too afraid to talk about it.
170400	172400	You see, they don't want to be called racist.
172400	175360	They're scared, but we're going to talk about it
175360	177200	because we're brave, aren't we?
177200	179120	Us talking about it.
179120	180560	Yeah, silly.
181120	186560	Lauren also tries to avoid accusations of racist and Nazi by saying,
186560	188720	this is a data-based video.
188720	191040	I'm going to be talking about statistics.
191040	192800	Statistics can't be racist.
192800	195040	You know, they're just a bunch of numbers.
195040	198160	So by the rhetorical framework I just imposed here,
198160	200320	I literally can't be a racist.
201760	203440	Well, we'll see about that.
204080	207440	So anyway, what is the topic of Lauren's video?
207440	211200	So bear with me because the thing I want to talk about today
211200	213680	is the Great Replacement.
213680	217440	The Great Replacement is a term coined by French writer Renaud Camus
217440	221760	referring to what he views as the irreversible overthrow of France
221760	225920	and its culture by Muslim immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa.
225920	228960	The Great Replacement is a very simple concept.
228960	232880	You have one people and in the space of a single generation,
232880	234960	you have a different people.
234960	236960	Despite various misrepresentations,
236960	242560	Camus does not oppose current immigration policy out of racism or Islamophobia,
242560	246720	but on the basis of the preservation of French traditions and culture.
246720	250720	And though Camus has had his eyes set specifically on France,
250720	256080	his concerns have been shared by many nationalist and identitarian movements all across Europe.
256720	259200	But the real question that comes in now is,
259200	263200	is there any evidence that a Great Replacement is actually occurring?
263200	267440	Or is Camus just another instance of paranoid white panic?
267440	271200	Is he just another racist xenophobe who deserves to be convicted of a hate
271200	273920	crime in order to pay a â‚¬4,000 fine?
273920	275600	Yeah, that actually happens in Europe.
276320	278400	I'll stop you there, Lauren, first off.
278400	282640	This says, in connection with two separate bar clashes in Paris
282640	284800	with people who accused him of hate crimes,
284800	287600	and then he didn't even appear in court for the verdict.
287600	289200	And apparently he was shouting,
289200	291760	I love Hitler, people like you would be dead,
291760	295840	your mothers, your forefathers would all be fucking gassed at people.
295840	297040	So, good.
297600	298800	Fuck that guy.
298800	301520	Anyway, let's talk about the Great Replacement,
301520	304080	which means white genocide, by the way.
304080	305680	It's the exact same concept.
305680	309200	It's just been given a makeover to try and sell it to more people.
309200	313760	White genocide is a conspiracy theory that says white people are dying out
313760	317840	due to a combination of race mixing and white people having children
317840	320400	at a slower rate than non-white people.
320400	322560	You know, as if it's a competition.
323200	325440	Now, not only is this not true,
325440	329120	there are more white people alive today than at any point in history,
329120	330880	it's also not genocide.
330880	333920	You know, even if it was happening, it's not deliberate.
333920	336880	It'd just be a demographic change over time.
336880	338720	That's not genocide.
338720	341040	No white people are getting killed because of this.
341040	343520	You know, that's white privilege for you,
343520	346880	I guess we even get the nice version of genocide.
346880	350000	Of course, the sorts of people who believe this rubbish will tell you
350000	354320	it is deliberate because it's supposedly the Jews doing it,
354320	357680	which, you know, they think because they're racist morons.
357680	360880	But people like Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux
360880	363600	and others who peddle this replacement rubbish,
363600	366640	well, they aren't allowed to say it's the Jews doing it
366640	370000	because then they'd lose their platforms for being openly racist.
370000	373360	So because they can't openly blame it on the Jews,
373360	376880	I can say it's not deliberate and therefore not genocide
376880	379760	and they're not allowed to retort, which is awfully fun.
379760	381840	It's a bit like cheating, you know.
381840	384080	They know they're being antisemitic
384080	386080	and I know they're being antisemitic,
386080	387920	but only I get to say it.
387920	392000	Anyway, so replacement is the PC term these people have come up with
392000	394640	to stand in for white genocide.
394640	397520	And it's a silly term, and I'll give you an example.
398320	401440	Here's a picture of a giraffe, say,
402080	404160	and now I'm going to replace that picture of a giraffe
404160	405760	with a picture of a dog.
406800	408640	Do you see what happens there?
408640	411680	I replaced one thing with another thing.
412240	413680	That's what replacement means.
414560	415840	Now let's try it another way.
416480	420480	Here's the picture of the giraffe and now here's the dog.
420480	423680	And would you look at that, we've got both.
423680	425280	They're both still there.
425280	427040	Nothing's been replaced, you know.
427040	429040	They both just are there now.
429760	430480	Do you follow?
431280	433280	Anyway, let's get into Lauren's data.
433840	435840	But despite all of these roadblocks,
435840	440160	the stats that we do have access to paint a pretty clear picture.
440800	445840	In 1993, 7% of the UK population was foreign born
445840	448560	and 3.6% were foreign nationals.
448560	451600	With the 2004 European Union enlargement
451600	454320	and drastic shifts in immigration policy,
454320	460720	those numbers rose to 13.5% and 8.9% in 2015.
460720	465440	These populations are primarily of Indian, Pakistani or African background.
465440	467600	Uh-oh, that was a lie.
467600	468400	Sorry, Lauren.
469040	473040	So the stats that were just showed there come from the Migration Observatory
473040	475040	from the University of Oxford.
475040	478480	And Lauren cites two sources from the Migration Observatory.
478480	480240	Let's take a look at those.
480240	484400	The first is long-term international migration flows to and from the UK.
484400	486400	And for a start, this one says,
486400	491440	the share of EU citizens in LTIM inflows and netflows has increased.
491440	494400	The share of EU citizens among incoming migrants
494400	498320	has been steadily increasing since 2004 when it stood at 22%
499120	502800	and is much higher than the average for the 2000 to 2003 period
502800	504080	when it stood at about 13%.
504880	507920	By contrast, the share of immigrants from outside the EU
507920	515040	has declined from 63% of all incoming migrants in 2004 to 45% in 2016.
515040	516560	So according to this study,
516560	521280	migrants from outside the EU account for less than half of the total incoming migrants.
521280	523360	Now, I know you're Canadian, Lauren.
523360	525120	Maybe you don't know that much about Europe,
525120	527600	so a little geography lesson for you.
527600	531600	India, Pakistan and Africa aren't in Europe.
532320	533360	It's not even close.
534080	537280	And if we take a look at the other Migration Observatory source,
537280	539680	Migrants in the UK, an overview,
539680	543840	that one actually lists the countries that migrants into the UK come from.
543840	546480	And the number one spot is Poland.
547120	550000	Poland tops the tables for both country of birth
550000	553360	and country of citizenship among migrants in the UK.
553360	555600	And take a look at these countries.
555600	559280	The vast majority of countries on this list are within Europe.
559280	562880	These are mainly European migrants coming into the UK.
562880	567840	These populations are primarily of Indian, Pakistani or African background
567840	570080	is just a flat-out lie.
570080	574080	Why is Lauren ignoring the Polish immigrants, for instance?
574080	576240	I wonder why that could possibly be.
578160	579520	Well, it's because they're white.
580240	580960	Obviously.
580960	583840	You see, this thumbnail with all the little black figures
583840	585840	outnumbering the little white figures,
585840	587680	that wouldn't make any sense if she was like,
587680	592000	oh yeah, by the way, most of these immigrants are just Europeans moving around the EU.
592000	594640	And those Europeans are generally white themselves.
594640	599200	You know, it's harder to scaremonger for a racist audience if you actually tell the truth.
599200	601680	But let's carry on and take a look at this headline.
602240	604320	Migrants change UK forever.
604320	608320	White Britons will be minority by 2066.
608320	609680	Let's talk about this.
609680	614560	So first off, this headline doesn't mean that white people will be a minority in the UK.
614560	620400	It means that self-identified white Britons will be not necessarily a minority
620400	623840	but not the overall statistical majority.
623840	625440	And what's the difference there?
625440	629600	Well, if 49% of the country identify as white British,
629600	631360	they'll still be the largest group
631360	635840	unless every single other person in the country identifies as the same thing.
635840	639520	In actuality, what you would have would be 49% white British
639520	642480	and then a certain percentage for Asian British,
642480	644800	a certain percentage for black British,
644800	647600	a certain percentage for white Irish.
647600	649120	You know, from the news report,
649120	653440	in the study, minorities are classed as people who also describe themselves in censuses
653440	655840	as Irish or another nationality.
655840	659280	So a certain percentage for white Polish people, I guess,
659280	663200	if we're acknowledging that they exist and aren't actually from Pakistan.
663200	666400	Anyway, the largest group would still be white British.
666400	668320	I mean, they're not going anywhere.
668320	670080	They'll still exist.
670080	671840	It's just that, cumulatively,
671840	676480	all the people who self-identify as something other than that added together
676480	678400	would be the slight majority.
679120	681120	In 50 years' time.
681120	684160	And it doesn't sound so scary when you put it like that, does it?
684160	686960	And this is all assuming that the current data trends
686960	691440	can be projected 50 years into the future while staying the same.
691440	694640	And it might be worthwhile looking at who compiled this data.
695280	699200	From the Express, it was Professor David Coleman.
699200	701280	Now, who is Professor David Coleman?
701280	704480	Well, he is the founder of Migration Watch UK.
705280	707360	Hello, Migration Watch UK.
707360	709200	It's nice to see you again so soon.
710240	713440	And he's also a member of the Galton Institute,
713440	716400	formerly known as the Eugenics Society.
716400	719600	And there's no prizes for guessing why they had to change the name.
719600	722640	It's actually quite funny how little effort you have to put in
722640	726240	to get past Lauren's gossamer-thin politically correct veil
726240	729120	and see all the weird Nazi shit behind her positions.
730000	734000	The first source on her list in her video description is
734000	739120	the Great Replacement Part 2, Great Britain, from Defend Europa,
739120	740960	written by a chap called William,
740960	744720	who handily links his Twitter account at realwilliam.
744720	747120	And let's see some of the things he has to say.
747120	748320	I'm still waiting.
748320	753120	Nobody can present me with conclusive evidence that gas chambers even existed,
753120	755280	let alone that six million we're gassed.
756160	757520	Am I a racist?
757520	761520	If racist means against other racers who wish to harm my race,
761520	764160	then yes, guilty as charged.
764160	769120	Capitalism and Bolshevism are two sides of the same international Jewish coin.
769840	771200	Adolf Hitler.
771200	773920	So, good first source there, Lauren.
773920	779040	A self-identified, Hitler-quoting, anti-Semitic, holocaust-denying racist.
779040	782480	I'm sure he's got an unbiased opinion about immigrants.
782480	784160	You know, I can't be racist.
784160	786160	I'm just quoting statistics.
786160	789760	Oh, by the way, my first source is a fucking Nazi.
789840	792960	And let's have a look at some of the top comments on Lauren's video,
792960	795840	which I screencapped before they started getting deleted.
796960	798000	1488.
798880	800560	It's a good start there, very subtle.
801440	802640	Here's some truth.
802640	805520	Jews were and are to blame for the Great Replacement.
805520	806640	Then a bunch of other crap.
807280	810960	The Great Replacement is a Jew-orchestrated plan of white genocide.
810960	812880	This is happening because of Jews.
812880	814320	The Jews hate us.
814320	816160	Zionist Jew degeneracy.
816800	817840	Etc.
817840	818800	And it goes on.
818800	821040	Quite the elephant in the room we have here.
821040	824960	This is the problem that people like Lauren are gonna run into again and again.
824960	828320	Their viewer base is just too clueless to play ball.
828320	830720	And it's difficult to sanitize white nationalism
830720	835040	when you have a bunch of dudes in white hoods behind you ranting about the Jewish question.
835040	837520	You know, we're all onto this game by now, Lauren.
837520	839280	You're not fooling anyone.
839280	843200	Anyway, let's carry on and have a bit of a think about Germany.
843200	846880	So, Lauren has a few sources about Germany in her video description there.
847600	849760	This from Information Liberation.
854400	855840	Now, that's not true.
855840	858400	If they were born in Germany, they're German citizens.
858400	859680	They're not foreigners.
859680	862480	What you mean to say and what you're actually outraged about
862480	864880	is that those people might not be white.
864880	869760	I also like this picture here which has a bunch of smiling children waving the German flag
869760	872880	and this is supposed to be a bad thing somehow.
872880	874960	There's also this story from the Daily Mail.
876880	885120	And the top comment on this article is pretty funny.
885920	887280	Migrant background?
887280	889680	That could still mean they were born and raised in Germany,
889680	891360	speak German as their first language,
891360	894000	and are German citizens with no other allegiance.
894000	895920	Very misleading headline.
895920	898160	That comment is from Tommy there.
898800	900720	Not Robinson, I assume.
900720	904400	As a side note here, this article manages to spell the word integrate
904400	907280	three different ways in just two sentences,
907280	909520	which is impressive, to say the least.
910560	912800	Anyway, yes, Tommy's right.
913520	917360	People of a migrant background doesn't mean migrants.
918000	920160	It means people of a migrant background,
920160	923840	which depending on where you want to mark the cutoff point in history,
923840	926160	that could include any number of people.
926160	929760	Also, again, not that it matters, but like in the UK,
929760	934000	the majority of these migrants are from other European countries.
934000	935040	Quoting the article,
935600	939840	Turkish migrants are the largest non-German minority that are settled in Frankfurt,
939840	942160	accounting for 13% of the population.
942160	945440	A further 61% of residents who were born abroad
945440	948720	have come from other countries within the European Union.
948720	950720	Lauren, again, doesn't mention this
950720	954960	because she's trying to mislead her audience about the race of the migrants.
954960	957920	You know, if the majority of them are other Europeans,
957920	960400	it ruins the white nationalist narrative.
960400	964000	There's another point here about the duration these migrants plan to stay,
964000	967600	because, of course, not all migrants are permanent migrants.
967600	970880	And looking again at Lauren's migration observatory source,
970880	974640	the share of immigrants planning to stay for shorter periods of one to two years
974640	977200	has increased since the 1990s,
977200	982640	with less than a third of incoming migrants planning to stay for a period of more than four years.
982640	987120	Lauren doesn't mention this and treats all migrants as though they are permanent migrants,
987120	990080	when the statistics just don't support this.
990080	993600	Anyway, let's move on and take a look at Lauren's main source,
993600	994960	which is this chap,
994960	996160	Renaud Camus.
996720	997920	Saying that wrong.
997920	1001200	And let's have a little read of a WordPress blog post
1001200	1004240	written about Camus and his replacement theory.
1004240	1007200	That I found in Lauren's sources, by the way.
1007200	1009920	Firstly, there is no racial replacement in Europe,
1009920	1013760	as the immigrants are not numerous enough to change the color of the locals.
1013760	1015680	Secondly, if there is a cultural drift,
1015680	1019040	is that drift due to immigration or perhaps to globalization,
1019040	1023840	i.e. fashions and behaviors from around the world coming to our doorstep via the internet?
1023840	1026880	His views lead him to make two astonishing statements.
1026880	1029680	Firstly, he takes Israel as a positive example
1029680	1033680	that Europe should be well advised to imitate by remigrating foreigners
1033680	1035520	back to their country of origin.
1035520	1040320	This is funny when one knows that Mr. Camus' supporters are in fact anti-Zionists,
1040320	1044480	as anti-Semitism is now called among the thinking elite.
1044480	1048160	Secondly, he argues that Europeans should contribute significantly more
1048160	1050960	to the economic support and development in the third world,
1050960	1054800	and in particular Africa, basically paying them to stay home
1054800	1057280	rather than having them come and eat our food.
1057280	1062480	No one of a serious mind will give support to Renault Camus for these odd views.
1063120	1063840	Well.
1063840	1066160	And again, I didn't go looking for that source.
1066160	1068800	This is listed in the description of Lauren's video.
1068800	1069760	You can go and check.
1070880	1075280	So anyway, I have a pro-video-making tip for you, Lauren.
1075280	1080320	Maybe don't include links to articles that imply your main source is an irrational idiot.
1080320	1081920	I mean, what happened there?
1081920	1084240	Were there not enough positive articles about the guy
1084240	1087760	so you had to include ones that dunk on him for being a moron?
1087760	1088720	I don't know.
1088720	1091120	So anyway, that WordPress blog was right.
1091120	1095120	Camus' plan to deal with the migrants is to re-migrate them,
1095120	1097120	i.e. ship them all back home.
1097920	1100720	In an article on Free West Media, Camus says,
1100800	1103120	The means and ends are one and the same.
1103120	1104240	Remigration.
1104240	1107920	The return of the conquering peoples to their own lands.
1108800	1110400	Conquering peoples.
1110400	1113440	So, okay, very sorry to everyone in the US and Canada,
1113440	1116000	but you're gonna have to move back to Europe.
1116000	1118160	Which is a bit concerning, to be perfectly honest.
1118160	1119680	I don't know where we're gonna put you all.
1120640	1123680	Of course, Camus probably doesn't mean this.
1123680	1128800	The arbitrary line he's drawn in history for when we need to stop migration and ship everyone back
1128800	1133040	is probably not gonna have to include any white people being shipped anywhere.
1133040	1134640	It's funny how that works, isn't it?
1135200	1137280	Also, Camus' plan wouldn't work.
1137920	1140560	Quite aside from the fact that it is literally impossible
1140560	1145120	to just ship every descendant of a migrant back to where they came from,
1145120	1149520	his measures don't go far enough to stop what he wants to stop.
1149520	1151440	Let's consider the world as a whole.
1152000	1155680	You know, there's no migration to the world, is there?
1155680	1156880	That we know about, anyway.
1157760	1163600	And now let's imagine that all birth rates were equal across every group and type of person.
1163600	1166720	So exactly equal birth rates for everyone.
1166720	1170160	And let's say that they're exactly at replacement levels everywhere,
1170160	1174400	so every country and race has a completely stable population.
1174400	1178400	Now then, what you would still see is the white population
1178400	1181760	declining as a percentage of the whole over time.
1181760	1182800	And why is that?
1182800	1185520	Well, it's because of how we classify whiteness.
1186080	1189200	Barack Obama, for instance, is seen as a black man,
1189200	1192560	despite having one black and one white parent.
1192560	1196160	Do you see my point here, any racist folk who are watching?
1196160	1199280	Immigration and birth rates don't matter.
1199280	1201280	Because of how we classify races,
1201280	1204560	to maintain the white population as the same percentage of the whole,
1204560	1207520	you would have to either ban interracial relationships
1207520	1211600	or introduce measures to reduce the birth rates of non-white people.
1211600	1215040	That is the only logical endpoint of what you're proposing.
1215120	1216960	And I imagine someone might say,
1216960	1222400	wait, but I'm not talking about race, I'm talking about culture and heritage.
1223280	1224720	Yeah, rubbish.
1225520	1228880	But admittedly, there is one aspect of this that isn't racial.
1228880	1232160	There is also a religious element to consider.
1232160	1234880	Trends in Europe tell the same overall story.
1234880	1237680	As the native European population dies out,
1237680	1240480	migrant and Muslim populations are rapidly growing,
1240480	1243600	with higher birth rates and unfettered mass immigration.
1243600	1247200	And with the median age of 32 for Muslims in Europe,
1247200	1250400	eight years younger than for all Europeans,
1250400	1253040	five years younger for the religiously unaffiliated,
1253040	1256000	and ten years younger for the European Christians,
1256000	1258720	the future of Europe looks pretty halal.
1258720	1262160	Now, sorry, Lauren, again, that's not true.
1262800	1264400	For a start, Camus states,
1264400	1266320	the great replacement is very simple.
1266320	1269680	You have one people, and in the space of our generation,
1269680	1271040	you have a different people.
1271840	1274160	The space of one generation.
1274160	1279200	So, how fast is the Muslim population in Europe actually growing?
1279200	1282000	Well, according to another link in Lauren's description,
1282000	1287520	by 2050, the population of Europe that is Muslim will be 10%.
1289360	1290320	Ten percent.
1290880	1297040	So, in 2050, I will be, for example, 62 years old.
1297680	1300480	So when exactly am I supposed to be replaced?
1301040	1303520	You know, you're telling me that if we don't act now,
1303520	1307840	then in 33 years, assuming current data trends hold, remember,
1308400	1311120	we'll still outnumber Muslims 9 to 1.
1311120	1315280	You know, excuse me if I don't throw myself out the window and panic here, Lauren.
1315280	1318560	The future of Europe looks pretty halal actually means
1318560	1325200	that in several decades, they will just about be 10% of the population.
1325200	1329120	And I can extrapolate data trends into the future too, as it turns out.
1329120	1331920	The Muslim population of Europe as a percentage of the whole
1331920	1335520	has been increasing by about 1% per decade.
1335520	1339680	So for a clear majority, after they hit 10% in 2050,
1339680	1345920	we'll just have to wait for around 40 decades, which is 400 years.
1345920	1348080	So act now, people of Europe.
1348080	1350880	We're in the year 2500.
1350880	1352800	We're really gonna be in trouble.
1352800	1355200	We'll have hover mosques or something.
1355840	1358400	Muslims flying around in little Jetsons cars.
1359840	1363440	Anyway, so let's talk about how this happened.
1363440	1367360	One of the biggest things that we can attribute to the cause of the great replacement
1367360	1370080	is Western ethno-masochism.
1370080	1372720	Basically, white people hate themselves.
1372720	1375760	And if you look at groups like Antifa or even just
1375760	1378720	your average college student or state broadcasters,
1379360	1384320	many white people feel that replacing themselves will relieve guilt of past crimes.
1384320	1388800	So unlike almost every other culture in the world that wants to preserve itself
1388800	1394240	and remain homogenous, Europeans actively invite the destruction of their tradition.
1394240	1398800	So Lauren says this is happening because white people hate themselves
1398800	1401840	and actively want their countries to be destroyed.
1401840	1404400	And it's a clever framing of the argument there.
1404400	1408720	You know, this bad thing is definitely happening and everyone agrees it is,
1408720	1411680	but some people just want it to happen, you know.
1411680	1416160	Well, speaking as a white man here, Lauren, I don't hate white people.
1417040	1419360	And I don't want my country to be destroyed.
1419360	1423840	But I still disagree with you because I think you're wrong.
1423840	1427680	You've tied culture and national identity to race.
1428400	1429680	And that's bullshit.
1429680	1432960	You don't have to be white to be a British person
1432960	1437120	or an American person or a German person and so on.
1437120	1441680	Insisting that the racial makeups of these countries is something to be concerned about
1441680	1446720	is just incorrect conspiracy theory racist nonsense.
1446720	1447520	Consider this.
1448240	1453760	In the last century, which of the following actually nearly destroyed Europe?
1453760	1457120	Was it immigrants and people who aren't white?
1457120	1461920	Or was it what Lauren would call a national identitarian movement
1461920	1465840	concerned about minorities changing the culture of their country?
1465840	1468080	Answers on a postcard, thanks.
1468080	1470240	And I'd like to address something else.
1470240	1475760	Lauren thinks that immigration and cultural change represent the death of tradition.
1475760	1476880	I disagree.
1476880	1478560	I think it is our tradition.
1479440	1482560	It's one of the traditions that's worth preserving.
1482560	1485440	When I think about great things my country has done,
1485440	1489680	the first thing that comes to mind is oppose the Nazis.
1489680	1491280	And we didn't do that alone.
1491280	1494480	Like, the RAF, for instance, fighting the Battle of Britain
1494480	1498320	had refugee pilots from all over Europe fighting in it.
1498320	1503360	And we also have a history of taking in migrants, sometimes huge amounts of migrants.
1504160	1506560	Let me talk about my own city for a little bit.
1507440	1509920	While the Irish Potato Famine was going on,
1509920	1516080	about a million Irish people emigrated out of Ireland in a relatively very short period of time.
1516080	1521360	And Liverpool, being a port city close to Ireland, is where a lot of those people ended up.
1522240	1528320	By 1851, about a quarter of Liverpool's population was Irish-born.
1528320	1533200	And that's born in Ireland, not descended from Irish people or whatever.
1533200	1538080	And I'm sure if we had YouTube back then, we'd have people proclaiming the doom of the country.
1538080	1540960	You know, all these Irish people will breed like rabbits.
1540960	1543520	They're all poor. They're a drain on the state.
1543520	1545040	They don't have jobs.
1545040	1547600	They're gonna out-breed us and take over.
1547600	1550720	Which, you know, it didn't happen, did it?
1550720	1552240	And now, someone might say,
1552240	1554640	well, Irish people aren't like today's immigrants.
1554640	1556080	They were able to integrate.
1556720	1558000	Sorry, integrate?
1558560	1560480	They integrated just fine.
1560480	1561440	No troubles there.
1562400	1563440	Troubles.
1563440	1564000	Do you get it?
1564640	1568560	You know, it's not like there'd ever be any Irish terrorists, would there?
1568560	1572000	It's not like Irish terrorists would set off the most powerful bomb
1572000	1575440	detonated in Great Britain since World War II, is it?
1575440	1579360	It's not like any Irish people would ever launch a mortar attack on Downing Street
1579360	1582240	in order to assassinate the Prime Minister, is it?
1583440	1585040	That's all true, by the way.
1585840	1589760	And now, a few decades later, nobody really cares.
1589760	1592880	You know, nobody is fretting about Irish birth rates.
1593440	1598000	No one's crossing the road or getting off a bus when they hear an Irish accent, are they?
1598000	1600880	Not many people in Britain are all that fussed anymore.
1600880	1602160	And I wonder why that is.
1602880	1603440	Not really.
1604080	1606240	Again, it's because they're white.
1606800	1608240	But what's my point here, really?
1608240	1611440	Well, Lauren, with regards to the whole white genocide thing,
1612080	1613840	just don't worry about it, you know?
1613840	1616320	Demographic change is inevitable.
1616320	1618480	It will happen, regardless of what you do.
1619200	1621440	It's not a matter of fighting it or not.
1621440	1622480	It can't be fought.
1622480	1624000	It's just what happens.
1624000	1625680	It's what's always happened.
1625680	1627600	And it's nothing to worry about.
1627600	1629760	And it won't be as bad as you think, anyway.
1630560	1633440	By the way, it won't be bad at all, of course, in any regard,
1633440	1635200	but I'm trying to speak her language here.
1635760	1638800	You see, birth rates are falling everywhere.
1638800	1642160	With medical advancements, less people need it for farming,
1642160	1644240	you know, more people living in cities,
1644240	1647600	a greater chance of kids living to see adulthood and so on,
1647600	1649600	fewer children are being born.
1649600	1651680	But this is happening globally.
1651680	1653360	I've mentioned this in another video,
1653360	1657200	but birth rates in predominantly Muslim countries are also falling.
1657200	1662400	Recent migrant populations might have more kids than the average in the country they've moved to,
1662400	1666400	but that's a mix of being generally poorer than the native population,
1666400	1668880	which resolves itself within a few generations,
1668880	1670560	and cultural norms,
1670560	1674320	which also even out after a couple of generations, by and large.
1674320	1676320	You know, anyone looking into the future
1676320	1681280	and trying to predict what different birth rates will be like in 2070 or something,
1681280	1683360	well, it's a fool's errand.
1683360	1684480	We don't know.
1684480	1686560	And I'd like to leave you all with a brief thought
1686560	1689920	about the white fear of becoming a minority.
1689920	1692800	And I'll say this to any fellow worried white people.
1693600	1695600	You are already a minority.
1696320	1698560	You're a minority in lots of ways,
1698560	1701600	many of which might seem trivial to you right now,
1701600	1705280	but what happens when a Nazi-like party comes to power
1705280	1708720	and starts again judging people by nose length,
1708720	1711680	or eye color, or skull shape?
1711680	1715520	You know, don't start hating on minorities in order to prevent becoming one,
1715520	1717120	because you already are,
1717120	1719520	so just get used to it, I guess.
1720240	1720960	And chill out.
1721520	1722960	Thanks for watching, everyone.
1723840	1726320	This Rome video is never gonna come out, is it?
1726320	1728320	Sorry, my fault, I keep getting distracted.
1728320	1731200	I should just completely log off the internet until it's done now.
1732320	1735120	Thanks as always to my supporters over on Patreon,
1735120	1738320	who almost literally put food in my mouth.
1738320	1739360	I love them all,
1739360	1742960	and I hope they all get exactly what they want for their birthdays.
1742960	1745520	And if you would like to be similarly complimented,
1745520	1747680	consider supporting me yourself.
1747680	1749760	It's positively exciting.
1750400	1753040	Also follow me on Twitter if you feel like.
1753040	1754160	Righty-ho, folks.
1754160	1755200	I'll see you soon.
