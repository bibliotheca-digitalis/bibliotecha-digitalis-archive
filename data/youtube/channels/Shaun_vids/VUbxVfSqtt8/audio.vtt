00:00.000 --> 00:01.280
Hello, everyone.

00:01.280 --> 00:06.880
Before we get to our main topic today, I want to talk very briefly about marathon running.

00:06.880 --> 00:14.000
So, way back in 1985, science journal Nature published an article predicting that by the year 2000,

00:14.000 --> 00:18.560
women would be consistently running faster marathon times than men.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.120
Now, what led them to make this prediction?

00:21.120 --> 00:23.200
Well, it was the data they had.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.480
They saw that men's marathon times had hit a plateau,

00:26.480 --> 00:30.640
and the record time was increasing only very slowly and by very small amounts.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.240
The women's record time, on the other hand, was increasing much faster.

00:34.240 --> 00:38.080
So by extrapolating out the very slow growth of the men's record time

00:38.080 --> 00:41.360
and the relatively fast growth of the women's record time,

00:41.360 --> 00:46.400
they predicted that women would catch up to and pass men within a decade or two.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.360
Now then, they made a mistake, didn't they?

00:49.360 --> 00:52.640
One which got them not a small amount of impolite mocking.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.240
And what was that?

00:54.240 --> 00:58.480
Well, by just extrapolating the current data trends into the future,

00:58.480 --> 01:03.200
you'd fairly quickly have women running the marathon faster than the speed of sound,

01:03.200 --> 01:06.080
which is probably highly unlikely.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.240
Where Nature went wrong was not considering any other factors

01:10.240 --> 01:13.360
which might have an effect on those data trends in the future.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.880
For example, women hitting the same plateau as the men did,

01:16.880 --> 01:18.880
which is, of course, what happened, you know?

01:19.520 --> 01:21.680
Women's times had been increasing quickly

01:21.680 --> 01:24.800
because not as many women were participating as men.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.440
Women's sports science wasn't as advanced as men's,

01:27.440 --> 01:31.920
but as women caught up to the men's times, those trends changed, obviously.

01:32.480 --> 01:37.520
So why am I talking about this blunder by a science journal in 1985?

01:37.520 --> 01:42.560
Well, I just want to highlight the danger of projecting current short-term data trends

01:42.560 --> 01:44.080
decades into the future.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.600
For example,

01:45.600 --> 01:48.800
Will birth rates among poorer immigrant populations

01:48.800 --> 01:52.240
remain the same several generations down the line?

01:52.880 --> 01:55.840
It's something to think about and keep in mind.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.080
So then, what's the actual topic of my video today?

02:00.080 --> 02:04.640
Well, it's a recent video uploaded by Lauren Southern called The Great Replacement,

02:04.640 --> 02:06.720
and let's watch the introduction to that.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.440
Hey, everyone.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.960
Okay, so today we are going to be talking about a very serious subject,

02:10.960 --> 02:14.880
something that I think a lot of people are too afraid to talk about

02:14.960 --> 02:17.760
because they're worried about being called a bigot

02:17.760 --> 02:21.360
by both the people on the left and the right, surprisingly.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.400
So in order to avoid people trying to discredit this video

02:24.400 --> 02:29.120
with name-calling of Nazi or propagandists or other such nonsense,

02:29.120 --> 02:32.800
it's going to be a very data-based video for the first bit.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.560
Yay, data analysis.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.040
That's me.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.120
I have a little alarm that goes off when someone says data on YouTube.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.560
So that intro there had a few of the regular white nationalist rhetorical tricks

02:44.560 --> 02:45.360
you see online.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.360
Lots of people agree with us.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.400
They're all just too afraid to talk about it.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.400
You see, they don't want to be called racist.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.360
They're scared, but we're going to talk about it

02:55.360 --> 02:57.200
because we're brave, aren't we?

02:57.200 --> 02:59.120
Us talking about it.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.560
Yeah, silly.

03:01.120 --> 03:06.560
Lauren also tries to avoid accusations of racist and Nazi by saying,

03:06.560 --> 03:08.720
this is a data-based video.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.040
I'm going to be talking about statistics.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.800
Statistics can't be racist.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.040
You know, they're just a bunch of numbers.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.160
So by the rhetorical framework I just imposed here,

03:18.160 --> 03:20.320
I literally can't be a racist.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.440
Well, we'll see about that.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.440
So anyway, what is the topic of Lauren's video?

03:27.440 --> 03:31.200
So bear with me because the thing I want to talk about today

03:31.200 --> 03:33.680
is the Great Replacement.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.440
The Great Replacement is a term coined by French writer Renaud Camus

03:37.440 --> 03:41.760
referring to what he views as the irreversible overthrow of France

03:41.760 --> 03:45.920
and its culture by Muslim immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.960
The Great Replacement is a very simple concept.

03:48.960 --> 03:52.880
You have one people and in the space of a single generation,

03:52.880 --> 03:54.960
you have a different people.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
Despite various misrepresentations,

03:56.960 --> 04:02.560
Camus does not oppose current immigration policy out of racism or Islamophobia,

04:02.560 --> 04:06.720
but on the basis of the preservation of French traditions and culture.

04:06.720 --> 04:10.720
And though Camus has had his eyes set specifically on France,

04:10.720 --> 04:16.080
his concerns have been shared by many nationalist and identitarian movements all across Europe.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.200
But the real question that comes in now is,

04:19.200 --> 04:23.200
is there any evidence that a Great Replacement is actually occurring?

04:23.200 --> 04:27.440
Or is Camus just another instance of paranoid white panic?

04:27.440 --> 04:31.200
Is he just another racist xenophobe who deserves to be convicted of a hate

04:31.200 --> 04:33.920
crime in order to pay a â‚¬4,000 fine?

04:33.920 --> 04:35.600
Yeah, that actually happens in Europe.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.400
I'll stop you there, Lauren, first off.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.640
This says, in connection with two separate bar clashes in Paris

04:42.640 --> 04:44.800
with people who accused him of hate crimes,

04:44.800 --> 04:47.600
and then he didn't even appear in court for the verdict.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.200
And apparently he was shouting,

04:49.200 --> 04:51.760
I love Hitler, people like you would be dead,

04:51.760 --> 04:55.840
your mothers, your forefathers would all be fucking gassed at people.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.040
So, good.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.800
Fuck that guy.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.520
Anyway, let's talk about the Great Replacement,

05:01.520 --> 05:04.080
which means white genocide, by the way.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.680
It's the exact same concept.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.200
It's just been given a makeover to try and sell it to more people.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.760
White genocide is a conspiracy theory that says white people are dying out

05:13.760 --> 05:17.840
due to a combination of race mixing and white people having children

05:17.840 --> 05:20.400
at a slower rate than non-white people.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.560
You know, as if it's a competition.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.440
Now, not only is this not true,

05:25.440 --> 05:29.120
there are more white people alive today than at any point in history,

05:29.120 --> 05:30.880
it's also not genocide.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.920
You know, even if it was happening, it's not deliberate.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.880
It'd just be a demographic change over time.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.720
That's not genocide.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.040
No white people are getting killed because of this.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.520
You know, that's white privilege for you,

05:43.520 --> 05:46.880
I guess we even get the nice version of genocide.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.000
Of course, the sorts of people who believe this rubbish will tell you

05:50.000 --> 05:54.320
it is deliberate because it's supposedly the Jews doing it,

05:54.320 --> 05:57.680
which, you know, they think because they're racist morons.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.880
But people like Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux

06:00.880 --> 06:03.600
and others who peddle this replacement rubbish,

06:03.600 --> 06:06.640
well, they aren't allowed to say it's the Jews doing it

06:06.640 --> 06:10.000
because then they'd lose their platforms for being openly racist.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.360
So because they can't openly blame it on the Jews,

06:13.360 --> 06:16.880
I can say it's not deliberate and therefore not genocide

06:16.880 --> 06:19.760
and they're not allowed to retort, which is awfully fun.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.840
It's a bit like cheating, you know.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.080
They know they're being antisemitic

06:24.080 --> 06:26.080
and I know they're being antisemitic,

06:26.080 --> 06:27.920
but only I get to say it.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.000
Anyway, so replacement is the PC term these people have come up with

06:32.000 --> 06:34.640
to stand in for white genocide.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.520
And it's a silly term, and I'll give you an example.

06:38.320 --> 06:41.440
Here's a picture of a giraffe, say,

06:42.080 --> 06:44.160
and now I'm going to replace that picture of a giraffe

06:44.160 --> 06:45.760
with a picture of a dog.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.640
Do you see what happens there?

06:48.640 --> 06:51.680
I replaced one thing with another thing.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.680
That's what replacement means.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.840
Now let's try it another way.

06:56.480 --> 07:00.480
Here's the picture of the giraffe and now here's the dog.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.680
And would you look at that, we've got both.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.280
They're both still there.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.040
Nothing's been replaced, you know.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.040
They both just are there now.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.480
Do you follow?

07:11.280 --> 07:13.280
Anyway, let's get into Lauren's data.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.840
But despite all of these roadblocks,

07:15.840 --> 07:20.160
the stats that we do have access to paint a pretty clear picture.

07:20.800 --> 07:25.840
In 1993, 7% of the UK population was foreign born

07:25.840 --> 07:28.560
and 3.6% were foreign nationals.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.600
With the 2004 European Union enlargement

07:31.600 --> 07:34.320
and drastic shifts in immigration policy,

07:34.320 --> 07:40.720
those numbers rose to 13.5% and 8.9% in 2015.

07:40.720 --> 07:45.440
These populations are primarily of Indian, Pakistani or African background.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.600
Uh-oh, that was a lie.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.400
Sorry, Lauren.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.040
So the stats that were just showed there come from the Migration Observatory

07:53.040 --> 07:55.040
from the University of Oxford.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.480
And Lauren cites two sources from the Migration Observatory.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.240
Let's take a look at those.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.400
The first is long-term international migration flows to and from the UK.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.400
And for a start, this one says,

08:06.400 --> 08:11.440
the share of EU citizens in LTIM inflows and netflows has increased.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.400
The share of EU citizens among incoming migrants

08:14.400 --> 08:18.320
has been steadily increasing since 2004 when it stood at 22%

08:19.120 --> 08:22.800
and is much higher than the average for the 2000 to 2003 period

08:22.800 --> 08:24.080
when it stood at about 13%.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.920
By contrast, the share of immigrants from outside the EU

08:27.920 --> 08:35.040
has declined from 63% of all incoming migrants in 2004 to 45% in 2016.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.560
So according to this study,

08:36.560 --> 08:41.280
migrants from outside the EU account for less than half of the total incoming migrants.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.360
Now, I know you're Canadian, Lauren.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.120
Maybe you don't know that much about Europe,

08:45.120 --> 08:47.600
so a little geography lesson for you.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.600
India, Pakistan and Africa aren't in Europe.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.360
It's not even close.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.280
And if we take a look at the other Migration Observatory source,

08:57.280 --> 08:59.680
Migrants in the UK, an overview,

08:59.680 --> 09:03.840
that one actually lists the countries that migrants into the UK come from.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.480
And the number one spot is Poland.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.000
Poland tops the tables for both country of birth

09:10.000 --> 09:13.360
and country of citizenship among migrants in the UK.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.600
And take a look at these countries.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.280
The vast majority of countries on this list are within Europe.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.880
These are mainly European migrants coming into the UK.

09:22.880 --> 09:27.840
These populations are primarily of Indian, Pakistani or African background

09:27.840 --> 09:30.080
is just a flat-out lie.

09:30.080 --> 09:34.080
Why is Lauren ignoring the Polish immigrants, for instance?

09:34.080 --> 09:36.240
I wonder why that could possibly be.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.520
Well, it's because they're white.

09:40.240 --> 09:40.960
Obviously.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.840
You see, this thumbnail with all the little black figures

09:43.840 --> 09:45.840
outnumbering the little white figures,

09:45.840 --> 09:47.680
that wouldn't make any sense if she was like,

09:47.680 --> 09:52.000
oh yeah, by the way, most of these immigrants are just Europeans moving around the EU.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.640
And those Europeans are generally white themselves.

09:54.640 --> 09:59.200
You know, it's harder to scaremonger for a racist audience if you actually tell the truth.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.680
But let's carry on and take a look at this headline.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.320
Migrants change UK forever.

10:04.320 --> 10:08.320
White Britons will be minority by 2066.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.680
Let's talk about this.

10:09.680 --> 10:14.560
So first off, this headline doesn't mean that white people will be a minority in the UK.

10:14.560 --> 10:20.400
It means that self-identified white Britons will be not necessarily a minority

10:20.400 --> 10:23.840
but not the overall statistical majority.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.440
And what's the difference there?

10:25.440 --> 10:29.600
Well, if 49% of the country identify as white British,

10:29.600 --> 10:31.360
they'll still be the largest group

10:31.360 --> 10:35.840
unless every single other person in the country identifies as the same thing.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.520
In actuality, what you would have would be 49% white British

10:39.520 --> 10:42.480
and then a certain percentage for Asian British,

10:42.480 --> 10:44.800
a certain percentage for black British,

10:44.800 --> 10:47.600
a certain percentage for white Irish.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.120
You know, from the news report,

10:49.120 --> 10:53.440
in the study, minorities are classed as people who also describe themselves in censuses

10:53.440 --> 10:55.840
as Irish or another nationality.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.280
So a certain percentage for white Polish people, I guess,

10:59.280 --> 11:03.200
if we're acknowledging that they exist and aren't actually from Pakistan.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.400
Anyway, the largest group would still be white British.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.320
I mean, they're not going anywhere.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.080
They'll still exist.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.840
It's just that, cumulatively,

11:11.840 --> 11:16.480
all the people who self-identify as something other than that added together

11:16.480 --> 11:18.400
would be the slight majority.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.120
In 50 years' time.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.160
And it doesn't sound so scary when you put it like that, does it?

11:24.160 --> 11:26.960
And this is all assuming that the current data trends

11:26.960 --> 11:31.440
can be projected 50 years into the future while staying the same.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.640
And it might be worthwhile looking at who compiled this data.

11:35.280 --> 11:39.200
From the Express, it was Professor David Coleman.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.280
Now, who is Professor David Coleman?

11:41.280 --> 11:44.480
Well, he is the founder of Migration Watch UK.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.360
Hello, Migration Watch UK.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.200
It's nice to see you again so soon.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.440
And he's also a member of the Galton Institute,

11:53.440 --> 11:56.400
formerly known as the Eugenics Society.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.600
And there's no prizes for guessing why they had to change the name.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.640
It's actually quite funny how little effort you have to put in

12:02.640 --> 12:06.240
to get past Lauren's gossamer-thin politically correct veil

12:06.240 --> 12:09.120
and see all the weird Nazi shit behind her positions.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
The first source on her list in her video description is

12:14.000 --> 12:19.120
the Great Replacement Part 2, Great Britain, from Defend Europa,

12:19.120 --> 12:20.960
written by a chap called William,

12:20.960 --> 12:24.720
who handily links his Twitter account at realwilliam.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.120
And let's see some of the things he has to say.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.320
I'm still waiting.

12:28.320 --> 12:33.120
Nobody can present me with conclusive evidence that gas chambers even existed,

12:33.120 --> 12:35.280
let alone that six million we're gassed.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.520
Am I a racist?

12:37.520 --> 12:41.520
If racist means against other racers who wish to harm my race,

12:41.520 --> 12:44.160
then yes, guilty as charged.

12:44.160 --> 12:49.120
Capitalism and Bolshevism are two sides of the same international Jewish coin.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.200
Adolf Hitler.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.920
So, good first source there, Lauren.

12:53.920 --> 12:59.040
A self-identified, Hitler-quoting, anti-Semitic, holocaust-denying racist.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.480
I'm sure he's got an unbiased opinion about immigrants.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.160
You know, I can't be racist.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.160
I'm just quoting statistics.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.760
Oh, by the way, my first source is a fucking Nazi.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.960
And let's have a look at some of the top comments on Lauren's video,

13:12.960 --> 13:15.840
which I screencapped before they started getting deleted.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.000
1488.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.560
It's a good start there, very subtle.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.640
Here's some truth.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.520
Jews were and are to blame for the Great Replacement.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.640
Then a bunch of other crap.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.960
The Great Replacement is a Jew-orchestrated plan of white genocide.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.880
This is happening because of Jews.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.320
The Jews hate us.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.160
Zionist Jew degeneracy.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.840
Etc.

13:37.840 --> 13:38.800
And it goes on.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.040
Quite the elephant in the room we have here.

13:41.040 --> 13:44.960
This is the problem that people like Lauren are gonna run into again and again.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.320
Their viewer base is just too clueless to play ball.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.720
And it's difficult to sanitize white nationalism

13:50.720 --> 13:55.040
when you have a bunch of dudes in white hoods behind you ranting about the Jewish question.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.520
You know, we're all onto this game by now, Lauren.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.280
You're not fooling anyone.

13:59.280 --> 14:03.200
Anyway, let's carry on and have a bit of a think about Germany.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.880
So, Lauren has a few sources about Germany in her video description there.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.760
This from Information Liberation.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.840
Now, that's not true.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.400
If they were born in Germany, they're German citizens.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.680
They're not foreigners.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.480
What you mean to say and what you're actually outraged about

14:22.480 --> 14:24.880
is that those people might not be white.

14:24.880 --> 14:29.760
I also like this picture here which has a bunch of smiling children waving the German flag

14:29.760 --> 14:32.880
and this is supposed to be a bad thing somehow.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.960
There's also this story from the Daily Mail.

14:36.880 --> 14:45.120
And the top comment on this article is pretty funny.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.280
Migrant background?

14:47.280 --> 14:49.680
That could still mean they were born and raised in Germany,

14:49.680 --> 14:51.360
speak German as their first language,

14:51.360 --> 14:54.000
and are German citizens with no other allegiance.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.920
Very misleading headline.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.160
That comment is from Tommy there.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.720
Not Robinson, I assume.

15:00.720 --> 15:04.400
As a side note here, this article manages to spell the word integrate

15:04.400 --> 15:07.280
three different ways in just two sentences,

15:07.280 --> 15:09.520
which is impressive, to say the least.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.800
Anyway, yes, Tommy's right.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.360
People of a migrant background doesn't mean migrants.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.160
It means people of a migrant background,

15:20.160 --> 15:23.840
which depending on where you want to mark the cutoff point in history,

15:23.840 --> 15:26.160
that could include any number of people.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.760
Also, again, not that it matters, but like in the UK,

15:29.760 --> 15:34.000
the majority of these migrants are from other European countries.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.040
Quoting the article,

15:35.600 --> 15:39.840
Turkish migrants are the largest non-German minority that are settled in Frankfurt,

15:39.840 --> 15:42.160
accounting for 13% of the population.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.440
A further 61% of residents who were born abroad

15:45.440 --> 15:48.720
have come from other countries within the European Union.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.720
Lauren, again, doesn't mention this

15:50.720 --> 15:54.960
because she's trying to mislead her audience about the race of the migrants.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.920
You know, if the majority of them are other Europeans,

15:57.920 --> 16:00.400
it ruins the white nationalist narrative.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.000
There's another point here about the duration these migrants plan to stay,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.600
because, of course, not all migrants are permanent migrants.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.880
And looking again at Lauren's migration observatory source,

16:10.880 --> 16:14.640
the share of immigrants planning to stay for shorter periods of one to two years

16:14.640 --> 16:17.200
has increased since the 1990s,

16:17.200 --> 16:22.640
with less than a third of incoming migrants planning to stay for a period of more than four years.

16:22.640 --> 16:27.120
Lauren doesn't mention this and treats all migrants as though they are permanent migrants,

16:27.120 --> 16:30.080
when the statistics just don't support this.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.600
Anyway, let's move on and take a look at Lauren's main source,

16:33.600 --> 16:34.960
which is this chap,

16:34.960 --> 16:36.160
Renaud Camus.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.920
Saying that wrong.

16:37.920 --> 16:41.200
And let's have a little read of a WordPress blog post

16:41.200 --> 16:44.240
written about Camus and his replacement theory.

16:44.240 --> 16:47.200
That I found in Lauren's sources, by the way.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.920
Firstly, there is no racial replacement in Europe,

16:49.920 --> 16:53.760
as the immigrants are not numerous enough to change the color of the locals.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.680
Secondly, if there is a cultural drift,

16:55.680 --> 16:59.040
is that drift due to immigration or perhaps to globalization,

16:59.040 --> 17:03.840
i.e. fashions and behaviors from around the world coming to our doorstep via the internet?

17:03.840 --> 17:06.880
His views lead him to make two astonishing statements.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.680
Firstly, he takes Israel as a positive example

17:09.680 --> 17:13.680
that Europe should be well advised to imitate by remigrating foreigners

17:13.680 --> 17:15.520
back to their country of origin.

17:15.520 --> 17:20.320
This is funny when one knows that Mr. Camus' supporters are in fact anti-Zionists,

17:20.320 --> 17:24.480
as anti-Semitism is now called among the thinking elite.

17:24.480 --> 17:28.160
Secondly, he argues that Europeans should contribute significantly more

17:28.160 --> 17:30.960
to the economic support and development in the third world,

17:30.960 --> 17:34.800
and in particular Africa, basically paying them to stay home

17:34.800 --> 17:37.280
rather than having them come and eat our food.

17:37.280 --> 17:42.480
No one of a serious mind will give support to Renault Camus for these odd views.

17:43.120 --> 17:43.840
Well.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.160
And again, I didn't go looking for that source.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.800
This is listed in the description of Lauren's video.

17:48.800 --> 17:49.760
You can go and check.

17:50.880 --> 17:55.280
So anyway, I have a pro-video-making tip for you, Lauren.

17:55.280 --> 18:00.320
Maybe don't include links to articles that imply your main source is an irrational idiot.

18:00.320 --> 18:01.920
I mean, what happened there?

18:01.920 --> 18:04.240
Were there not enough positive articles about the guy

18:04.240 --> 18:07.760
so you had to include ones that dunk on him for being a moron?

18:07.760 --> 18:08.720
I don't know.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.120
So anyway, that WordPress blog was right.

18:11.120 --> 18:15.120
Camus' plan to deal with the migrants is to re-migrate them,

18:15.120 --> 18:17.120
i.e. ship them all back home.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.720
In an article on Free West Media, Camus says,

18:20.800 --> 18:23.120
The means and ends are one and the same.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.240
Remigration.

18:24.240 --> 18:27.920
The return of the conquering peoples to their own lands.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.400
Conquering peoples.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.440
So, okay, very sorry to everyone in the US and Canada,

18:33.440 --> 18:36.000
but you're gonna have to move back to Europe.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.160
Which is a bit concerning, to be perfectly honest.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.680
I don't know where we're gonna put you all.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.680
Of course, Camus probably doesn't mean this.

18:43.680 --> 18:48.800
The arbitrary line he's drawn in history for when we need to stop migration and ship everyone back

18:48.800 --> 18:53.040
is probably not gonna have to include any white people being shipped anywhere.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.640
It's funny how that works, isn't it?

18:55.200 --> 18:57.280
Also, Camus' plan wouldn't work.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.560
Quite aside from the fact that it is literally impossible

19:00.560 --> 19:05.120
to just ship every descendant of a migrant back to where they came from,

19:05.120 --> 19:09.520
his measures don't go far enough to stop what he wants to stop.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.440
Let's consider the world as a whole.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.680
You know, there's no migration to the world, is there?

19:15.680 --> 19:16.880
That we know about, anyway.

19:17.760 --> 19:23.600
And now let's imagine that all birth rates were equal across every group and type of person.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.720
So exactly equal birth rates for everyone.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.160
And let's say that they're exactly at replacement levels everywhere,

19:30.160 --> 19:34.400
so every country and race has a completely stable population.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.400
Now then, what you would still see is the white population

19:38.400 --> 19:41.760
declining as a percentage of the whole over time.

19:41.760 --> 19:42.800
And why is that?

19:42.800 --> 19:45.520
Well, it's because of how we classify whiteness.

19:46.080 --> 19:49.200
Barack Obama, for instance, is seen as a black man,

19:49.200 --> 19:52.560
despite having one black and one white parent.

19:52.560 --> 19:56.160
Do you see my point here, any racist folk who are watching?

19:56.160 --> 19:59.280
Immigration and birth rates don't matter.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.280
Because of how we classify races,

20:01.280 --> 20:04.560
to maintain the white population as the same percentage of the whole,

20:04.560 --> 20:07.520
you would have to either ban interracial relationships

20:07.520 --> 20:11.600
or introduce measures to reduce the birth rates of non-white people.

20:11.600 --> 20:15.040
That is the only logical endpoint of what you're proposing.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.960
And I imagine someone might say,

20:16.960 --> 20:22.400
wait, but I'm not talking about race, I'm talking about culture and heritage.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.720
Yeah, rubbish.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.880
But admittedly, there is one aspect of this that isn't racial.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.160
There is also a religious element to consider.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.880
Trends in Europe tell the same overall story.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.680
As the native European population dies out,

20:37.680 --> 20:40.480
migrant and Muslim populations are rapidly growing,

20:40.480 --> 20:43.600
with higher birth rates and unfettered mass immigration.

20:43.600 --> 20:47.200
And with the median age of 32 for Muslims in Europe,

20:47.200 --> 20:50.400
eight years younger than for all Europeans,

20:50.400 --> 20:53.040
five years younger for the religiously unaffiliated,

20:53.040 --> 20:56.000
and ten years younger for the European Christians,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.720
the future of Europe looks pretty halal.

20:58.720 --> 21:02.160
Now, sorry, Lauren, again, that's not true.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.400
For a start, Camus states,

21:04.400 --> 21:06.320
the great replacement is very simple.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.680
You have one people, and in the space of our generation,

21:09.680 --> 21:11.040
you have a different people.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.160
The space of one generation.

21:14.160 --> 21:19.200
So, how fast is the Muslim population in Europe actually growing?

21:19.200 --> 21:22.000
Well, according to another link in Lauren's description,

21:22.000 --> 21:27.520
by 2050, the population of Europe that is Muslim will be 10%.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.320
Ten percent.

21:30.880 --> 21:37.040
So, in 2050, I will be, for example, 62 years old.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.480
So when exactly am I supposed to be replaced?

21:41.040 --> 21:43.520
You know, you're telling me that if we don't act now,

21:43.520 --> 21:47.840
then in 33 years, assuming current data trends hold, remember,

21:48.400 --> 21:51.120
we'll still outnumber Muslims 9 to 1.

21:51.120 --> 21:55.280
You know, excuse me if I don't throw myself out the window and panic here, Lauren.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.560
The future of Europe looks pretty halal actually means

21:58.560 --> 22:05.200
that in several decades, they will just about be 10% of the population.

22:05.200 --> 22:09.120
And I can extrapolate data trends into the future too, as it turns out.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.920
The Muslim population of Europe as a percentage of the whole

22:11.920 --> 22:15.520
has been increasing by about 1% per decade.

22:15.520 --> 22:19.680
So for a clear majority, after they hit 10% in 2050,

22:19.680 --> 22:25.920
we'll just have to wait for around 40 decades, which is 400 years.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.080
So act now, people of Europe.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.880
We're in the year 2500.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.800
We're really gonna be in trouble.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.200
We'll have hover mosques or something.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.400
Muslims flying around in little Jetsons cars.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.440
Anyway, so let's talk about how this happened.

22:43.440 --> 22:47.360
One of the biggest things that we can attribute to the cause of the great replacement

22:47.360 --> 22:50.080
is Western ethno-masochism.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.720
Basically, white people hate themselves.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.760
And if you look at groups like Antifa or even just

22:55.760 --> 22:58.720
your average college student or state broadcasters,

22:59.360 --> 23:04.320
many white people feel that replacing themselves will relieve guilt of past crimes.

23:04.320 --> 23:08.800
So unlike almost every other culture in the world that wants to preserve itself

23:08.800 --> 23:14.240
and remain homogenous, Europeans actively invite the destruction of their tradition.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.800
So Lauren says this is happening because white people hate themselves

23:18.800 --> 23:21.840
and actively want their countries to be destroyed.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.400
And it's a clever framing of the argument there.

23:24.400 --> 23:28.720
You know, this bad thing is definitely happening and everyone agrees it is,

23:28.720 --> 23:31.680
but some people just want it to happen, you know.

23:31.680 --> 23:36.160
Well, speaking as a white man here, Lauren, I don't hate white people.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.360
And I don't want my country to be destroyed.

23:39.360 --> 23:43.840
But I still disagree with you because I think you're wrong.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.680
You've tied culture and national identity to race.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.680
And that's bullshit.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.960
You don't have to be white to be a British person

23:52.960 --> 23:57.120
or an American person or a German person and so on.

23:57.120 --> 24:01.680
Insisting that the racial makeups of these countries is something to be concerned about

24:01.680 --> 24:06.720
is just incorrect conspiracy theory racist nonsense.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.520
Consider this.

24:08.240 --> 24:13.760
In the last century, which of the following actually nearly destroyed Europe?

24:13.760 --> 24:17.120
Was it immigrants and people who aren't white?

24:17.120 --> 24:21.920
Or was it what Lauren would call a national identitarian movement

24:21.920 --> 24:25.840
concerned about minorities changing the culture of their country?

24:25.840 --> 24:28.080
Answers on a postcard, thanks.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.240
And I'd like to address something else.

24:30.240 --> 24:35.760
Lauren thinks that immigration and cultural change represent the death of tradition.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.880
I disagree.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.560
I think it is our tradition.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.560
It's one of the traditions that's worth preserving.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.440
When I think about great things my country has done,

24:45.440 --> 24:49.680
the first thing that comes to mind is oppose the Nazis.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.280
And we didn't do that alone.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.480
Like, the RAF, for instance, fighting the Battle of Britain

24:54.480 --> 24:58.320
had refugee pilots from all over Europe fighting in it.

24:58.320 --> 25:03.360
And we also have a history of taking in migrants, sometimes huge amounts of migrants.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.560
Let me talk about my own city for a little bit.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.920
While the Irish Potato Famine was going on,

25:09.920 --> 25:16.080
about a million Irish people emigrated out of Ireland in a relatively very short period of time.

25:16.080 --> 25:21.360
And Liverpool, being a port city close to Ireland, is where a lot of those people ended up.

25:22.240 --> 25:28.320
By 1851, about a quarter of Liverpool's population was Irish-born.

25:28.320 --> 25:33.200
And that's born in Ireland, not descended from Irish people or whatever.

25:33.200 --> 25:38.080
And I'm sure if we had YouTube back then, we'd have people proclaiming the doom of the country.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.960
You know, all these Irish people will breed like rabbits.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.520
They're all poor. They're a drain on the state.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.040
They don't have jobs.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.600
They're gonna out-breed us and take over.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.720
Which, you know, it didn't happen, did it?

25:50.720 --> 25:52.240
And now, someone might say,

25:52.240 --> 25:54.640
well, Irish people aren't like today's immigrants.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.080
They were able to integrate.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.000
Sorry, integrate?

25:58.560 --> 26:00.480
They integrated just fine.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.440
No troubles there.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.440
Troubles.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.000
Do you get it?

26:04.640 --> 26:08.560
You know, it's not like there'd ever be any Irish terrorists, would there?

26:08.560 --> 26:12.000
It's not like Irish terrorists would set off the most powerful bomb

26:12.000 --> 26:15.440
detonated in Great Britain since World War II, is it?

26:15.440 --> 26:19.360
It's not like any Irish people would ever launch a mortar attack on Downing Street

26:19.360 --> 26:22.240
in order to assassinate the Prime Minister, is it?

26:23.440 --> 26:25.040
That's all true, by the way.

26:25.840 --> 26:29.760
And now, a few decades later, nobody really cares.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.880
You know, nobody is fretting about Irish birth rates.

26:33.440 --> 26:38.000
No one's crossing the road or getting off a bus when they hear an Irish accent, are they?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.880
Not many people in Britain are all that fussed anymore.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.160
And I wonder why that is.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.440
Not really.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.240
Again, it's because they're white.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.240
But what's my point here, really?

26:48.240 --> 26:51.440
Well, Lauren, with regards to the whole white genocide thing,

26:52.080 --> 26:53.840
just don't worry about it, you know?

26:53.840 --> 26:56.320
Demographic change is inevitable.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.480
It will happen, regardless of what you do.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.440
It's not a matter of fighting it or not.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.480
It can't be fought.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.000
It's just what happens.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.680
It's what's always happened.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.600
And it's nothing to worry about.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.760
And it won't be as bad as you think, anyway.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.440
By the way, it won't be bad at all, of course, in any regard,

27:13.440 --> 27:15.200
but I'm trying to speak her language here.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.800
You see, birth rates are falling everywhere.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.160
With medical advancements, less people need it for farming,

27:22.160 --> 27:24.240
you know, more people living in cities,

27:24.240 --> 27:27.600
a greater chance of kids living to see adulthood and so on,

27:27.600 --> 27:29.600
fewer children are being born.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.680
But this is happening globally.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.360
I've mentioned this in another video,

27:33.360 --> 27:37.200
but birth rates in predominantly Muslim countries are also falling.

27:37.200 --> 27:42.400
Recent migrant populations might have more kids than the average in the country they've moved to,

27:42.400 --> 27:46.400
but that's a mix of being generally poorer than the native population,

27:46.400 --> 27:48.880
which resolves itself within a few generations,

27:48.880 --> 27:50.560
and cultural norms,

27:50.560 --> 27:54.320
which also even out after a couple of generations, by and large.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.320
You know, anyone looking into the future

27:56.320 --> 28:01.280
and trying to predict what different birth rates will be like in 2070 or something,

28:01.280 --> 28:03.360
well, it's a fool's errand.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.480
We don't know.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.560
And I'd like to leave you all with a brief thought

28:06.560 --> 28:09.920
about the white fear of becoming a minority.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.800
And I'll say this to any fellow worried white people.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.600
You are already a minority.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.560
You're a minority in lots of ways,

28:18.560 --> 28:21.600
many of which might seem trivial to you right now,

28:21.600 --> 28:25.280
but what happens when a Nazi-like party comes to power

28:25.280 --> 28:28.720
and starts again judging people by nose length,

28:28.720 --> 28:31.680
or eye color, or skull shape?

28:31.680 --> 28:35.520
You know, don't start hating on minorities in order to prevent becoming one,

28:35.520 --> 28:37.120
because you already are,

28:37.120 --> 28:39.520
so just get used to it, I guess.

28:40.240 --> 28:40.960
And chill out.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.960
Thanks for watching, everyone.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.320
This Rome video is never gonna come out, is it?

28:46.320 --> 28:48.320
Sorry, my fault, I keep getting distracted.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.200
I should just completely log off the internet until it's done now.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.120
Thanks as always to my supporters over on Patreon,

28:55.120 --> 28:58.320
who almost literally put food in my mouth.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.360
I love them all,

28:59.360 --> 29:02.960
and I hope they all get exactly what they want for their birthdays.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.520
And if you would like to be similarly complimented,

29:05.520 --> 29:07.680
consider supporting me yourself.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.760
It's positively exciting.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.040
Also follow me on Twitter if you feel like.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.160
Righty-ho, folks.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.200
I'll see you soon.
