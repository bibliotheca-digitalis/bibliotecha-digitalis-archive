00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,880
Before we get to our main topic today, I want to talk very briefly about marathon running.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:14,000
So, way back in 1985, science journal Nature published an article predicting that by the year 2000,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,560
women would be consistently running faster marathon times than men.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,120
Now, what led them to make this prediction?

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,200
Well, it was the data they had.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,480
They saw that men's marathon times had hit a plateau,

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
and the record time was increasing only very slowly and by very small amounts.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,240
The women's record time, on the other hand, was increasing much faster.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,080
So by extrapolating out the very slow growth of the men's record time

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,360
and the relatively fast growth of the women's record time,

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,400
they predicted that women would catch up to and pass men within a decade or two.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,360
Now then, they made a mistake, didn't they?

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
One which got them not a small amount of impolite mocking.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,240
And what was that?

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,480
Well, by just extrapolating the current data trends into the future,

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,200
you'd fairly quickly have women running the marathon faster than the speed of sound,

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,080
which is probably highly unlikely.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,240
Where Nature went wrong was not considering any other factors

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,360
which might have an effect on those data trends in the future.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,880
For example, women hitting the same plateau as the men did,

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
which is, of course, what happened, you know?

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,680
Women's times had been increasing quickly

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,800
because not as many women were participating as men.

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,440
Women's sports science wasn't as advanced as men's,

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,920
but as women caught up to the men's times, those trends changed, obviously.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,520
So why am I talking about this blunder by a science journal in 1985?

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,560
Well, I just want to highlight the danger of projecting current short-term data trends

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,080
decades into the future.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,600
For example,

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,800
Will birth rates among poorer immigrant populations

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,240
remain the same several generations down the line?

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,840
It's something to think about and keep in mind.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,080
So then, what's the actual topic of my video today?

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,640
Well, it's a recent video uploaded by Lauren Southern called The Great Replacement,

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,720
and let's watch the introduction to that.

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,440
Hey, everyone.

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,960
Okay, so today we are going to be talking about a very serious subject,

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,880
something that I think a lot of people are too afraid to talk about

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,760
because they're worried about being called a bigot

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
by both the people on the left and the right, surprisingly.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
So in order to avoid people trying to discredit this video

43
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,120
with name-calling of Nazi or propagandists or other such nonsense,

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,800
it's going to be a very data-based video for the first bit.

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,560
Yay, data analysis.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,040
That's me.

47
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,120
I have a little alarm that goes off when someone says data on YouTube.

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,560
So that intro there had a few of the regular white nationalist rhetorical tricks

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,360
you see online.

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,360
Lots of people agree with us.

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,400
They're all just too afraid to talk about it.

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
You see, they don't want to be called racist.

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
They're scared, but we're going to talk about it

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,200
because we're brave, aren't we?

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
Us talking about it.

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,560
Yeah, silly.

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,560
Lauren also tries to avoid accusations of racist and Nazi by saying,

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,720
this is a data-based video.

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm going to be talking about statistics.

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,800
Statistics can't be racist.

61
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
You know, they're just a bunch of numbers.

62
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,160
So by the rhetorical framework I just imposed here,

63
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,320
I literally can't be a racist.

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,440
Well, we'll see about that.

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,440
So anyway, what is the topic of Lauren's video?

66
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,200
So bear with me because the thing I want to talk about today

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,680
is the Great Replacement.

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,440
The Great Replacement is a term coined by French writer Renaud Camus

69
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,760
referring to what he views as the irreversible overthrow of France

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,920
and its culture by Muslim immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa.

71
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,960
The Great Replacement is a very simple concept.

72
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,880
You have one people and in the space of a single generation,

73
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,960
you have a different people.

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Despite various misrepresentations,

75
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,560
Camus does not oppose current immigration policy out of racism or Islamophobia,

76
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,720
but on the basis of the preservation of French traditions and culture.

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,720
And though Camus has had his eyes set specifically on France,

78
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,080
his concerns have been shared by many nationalist and identitarian movements all across Europe.

79
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,200
But the real question that comes in now is,

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
is there any evidence that a Great Replacement is actually occurring?

81
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,440
Or is Camus just another instance of paranoid white panic?

82
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,200
Is he just another racist xenophobe who deserves to be convicted of a hate

83
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,920
crime in order to pay a â‚¬4,000 fine?

84
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,600
Yeah, that actually happens in Europe.

85
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,400
I'll stop you there, Lauren, first off.

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,640
This says, in connection with two separate bar clashes in Paris

87
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,800
with people who accused him of hate crimes,

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,600
and then he didn't even appear in court for the verdict.

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
And apparently he was shouting,

90
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,760
I love Hitler, people like you would be dead,

91
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,840
your mothers, your forefathers would all be fucking gassed at people.

92
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
So, good.

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Fuck that guy.

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,520
Anyway, let's talk about the Great Replacement,

95
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
which means white genocide, by the way.

96
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
It's the exact same concept.

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,200
It's just been given a makeover to try and sell it to more people.

98
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,760
White genocide is a conspiracy theory that says white people are dying out

99
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,840
due to a combination of race mixing and white people having children

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
at a slower rate than non-white people.

101
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
You know, as if it's a competition.

102
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,440
Now, not only is this not true,

103
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,120
there are more white people alive today than at any point in history,

104
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
it's also not genocide.

105
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,920
You know, even if it was happening, it's not deliberate.

106
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,880
It'd just be a demographic change over time.

107
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,720
That's not genocide.

108
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,040
No white people are getting killed because of this.

109
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,520
You know, that's white privilege for you,

110
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,880
I guess we even get the nice version of genocide.

111
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,000
Of course, the sorts of people who believe this rubbish will tell you

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,320
it is deliberate because it's supposedly the Jews doing it,

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,680
which, you know, they think because they're racist morons.

114
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,880
But people like Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux

115
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,600
and others who peddle this replacement rubbish,

116
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,640
well, they aren't allowed to say it's the Jews doing it

117
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,000
because then they'd lose their platforms for being openly racist.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,360
So because they can't openly blame it on the Jews,

119
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,880
I can say it's not deliberate and therefore not genocide

120
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,760
and they're not allowed to retort, which is awfully fun.

121
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,840
It's a bit like cheating, you know.

122
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,080
They know they're being antisemitic

123
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
and I know they're being antisemitic,

124
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,920
but only I get to say it.

125
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,000
Anyway, so replacement is the PC term these people have come up with

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,640
to stand in for white genocide.

127
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,520
And it's a silly term, and I'll give you an example.

128
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,440
Here's a picture of a giraffe, say,

129
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
and now I'm going to replace that picture of a giraffe

130
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760
with a picture of a dog.

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Do you see what happens there?

132
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,680
I replaced one thing with another thing.

133
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
That's what replacement means.

134
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
Now let's try it another way.

135
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Here's the picture of the giraffe and now here's the dog.

136
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,680
And would you look at that, we've got both.

137
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
They're both still there.

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,040
Nothing's been replaced, you know.

139
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
They both just are there now.

140
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Do you follow?

141
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Anyway, let's get into Lauren's data.

142
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
But despite all of these roadblocks,

143
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,160
the stats that we do have access to paint a pretty clear picture.

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,840
In 1993, 7% of the UK population was foreign born

145
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
and 3.6% were foreign nationals.

146
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,600
With the 2004 European Union enlargement

147
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,320
and drastic shifts in immigration policy,

148
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,720
those numbers rose to 13.5% and 8.9% in 2015.

149
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,440
These populations are primarily of Indian, Pakistani or African background.

150
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,600
Uh-oh, that was a lie.

151
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,400
Sorry, Lauren.

152
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,040
So the stats that were just showed there come from the Migration Observatory

153
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
from the University of Oxford.

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,480
And Lauren cites two sources from the Migration Observatory.

155
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,240
Let's take a look at those.

156
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,400
The first is long-term international migration flows to and from the UK.

157
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
And for a start, this one says,

158
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,440
the share of EU citizens in LTIM inflows and netflows has increased.

159
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,400
The share of EU citizens among incoming migrants

160
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,320
has been steadily increasing since 2004 when it stood at 22%

161
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,800
and is much higher than the average for the 2000 to 2003 period

162
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,080
when it stood at about 13%.

163
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,920
By contrast, the share of immigrants from outside the EU

164
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:35,040
has declined from 63% of all incoming migrants in 2004 to 45% in 2016.

165
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,560
So according to this study,

166
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,280
migrants from outside the EU account for less than half of the total incoming migrants.

167
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,360
Now, I know you're Canadian, Lauren.

168
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
Maybe you don't know that much about Europe,

169
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
so a little geography lesson for you.

170
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
India, Pakistan and Africa aren't in Europe.

171
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,360
It's not even close.

172
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,280
And if we take a look at the other Migration Observatory source,

173
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,680
Migrants in the UK, an overview,

174
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,840
that one actually lists the countries that migrants into the UK come from.

175
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,480
And the number one spot is Poland.

176
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
Poland tops the tables for both country of birth

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,360
and country of citizenship among migrants in the UK.

178
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,600
And take a look at these countries.

179
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,280
The vast majority of countries on this list are within Europe.

180
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,880
These are mainly European migrants coming into the UK.

181
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,840
These populations are primarily of Indian, Pakistani or African background

182
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,080
is just a flat-out lie.

183
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Why is Lauren ignoring the Polish immigrants, for instance?

184
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,240
I wonder why that could possibly be.

185
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,520
Well, it's because they're white.

186
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,960
Obviously.

187
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,840
You see, this thumbnail with all the little black figures

188
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
outnumbering the little white figures,

189
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,680
that wouldn't make any sense if she was like,

190
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,000
oh yeah, by the way, most of these immigrants are just Europeans moving around the EU.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,640
And those Europeans are generally white themselves.

192
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,200
You know, it's harder to scaremonger for a racist audience if you actually tell the truth.

193
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
But let's carry on and take a look at this headline.

194
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
Migrants change UK forever.

195
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,320
White Britons will be minority by 2066.

196
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
Let's talk about this.

197
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,560
So first off, this headline doesn't mean that white people will be a minority in the UK.

198
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,400
It means that self-identified white Britons will be not necessarily a minority

199
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,840
but not the overall statistical majority.

200
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,440
And what's the difference there?

201
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
Well, if 49% of the country identify as white British,

202
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,360
they'll still be the largest group

203
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,840
unless every single other person in the country identifies as the same thing.

204
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,520
In actuality, what you would have would be 49% white British

205
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,480
and then a certain percentage for Asian British,

206
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
a certain percentage for black British,

207
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,600
a certain percentage for white Irish.

208
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,120
You know, from the news report,

209
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,440
in the study, minorities are classed as people who also describe themselves in censuses

210
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,840
as Irish or another nationality.

211
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,280
So a certain percentage for white Polish people, I guess,

212
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,200
if we're acknowledging that they exist and aren't actually from Pakistan.

213
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,400
Anyway, the largest group would still be white British.

214
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,320
I mean, they're not going anywhere.

215
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,080
They'll still exist.

216
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,840
It's just that, cumulatively,

217
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,480
all the people who self-identify as something other than that added together

218
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,400
would be the slight majority.

219
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
In 50 years' time.

220
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,160
And it doesn't sound so scary when you put it like that, does it?

221
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,960
And this is all assuming that the current data trends

222
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,440
can be projected 50 years into the future while staying the same.

223
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
And it might be worthwhile looking at who compiled this data.

224
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,200
From the Express, it was Professor David Coleman.

225
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,280
Now, who is Professor David Coleman?

226
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,480
Well, he is the founder of Migration Watch UK.

227
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,360
Hello, Migration Watch UK.

228
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
It's nice to see you again so soon.

229
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,440
And he's also a member of the Galton Institute,

230
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,400
formerly known as the Eugenics Society.

231
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,600
And there's no prizes for guessing why they had to change the name.

232
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,640
It's actually quite funny how little effort you have to put in

233
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,240
to get past Lauren's gossamer-thin politically correct veil

234
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
and see all the weird Nazi shit behind her positions.

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The first source on her list in her video description is

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,120
the Great Replacement Part 2, Great Britain, from Defend Europa,

237
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,960
written by a chap called William,

238
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,720
who handily links his Twitter account at realwilliam.

239
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
And let's see some of the things he has to say.

240
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
I'm still waiting.

241
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,120
Nobody can present me with conclusive evidence that gas chambers even existed,

242
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,280
let alone that six million we're gassed.

243
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,520
Am I a racist?

244
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,520
If racist means against other racers who wish to harm my race,

245
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,160
then yes, guilty as charged.

246
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,120
Capitalism and Bolshevism are two sides of the same international Jewish coin.

247
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,200
Adolf Hitler.

248
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
So, good first source there, Lauren.

249
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,040
A self-identified, Hitler-quoting, anti-Semitic, holocaust-denying racist.

250
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,480
I'm sure he's got an unbiased opinion about immigrants.

251
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
You know, I can't be racist.

252
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
I'm just quoting statistics.

253
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,760
Oh, by the way, my first source is a fucking Nazi.

254
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,960
And let's have a look at some of the top comments on Lauren's video,

255
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,840
which I screencapped before they started getting deleted.

256
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,000
1488.

257
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
It's a good start there, very subtle.

258
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,640
Here's some truth.

259
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,520
Jews were and are to blame for the Great Replacement.

260
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,640
Then a bunch of other crap.

261
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,960
The Great Replacement is a Jew-orchestrated plan of white genocide.

262
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,880
This is happening because of Jews.

263
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,320
The Jews hate us.

264
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,160
Zionist Jew degeneracy.

265
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,840
Etc.

266
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,800
And it goes on.

267
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,040
Quite the elephant in the room we have here.

268
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,960
This is the problem that people like Lauren are gonna run into again and again.

269
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,320
Their viewer base is just too clueless to play ball.

270
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,720
And it's difficult to sanitize white nationalism

271
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,040
when you have a bunch of dudes in white hoods behind you ranting about the Jewish question.

272
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,520
You know, we're all onto this game by now, Lauren.

273
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,280
You're not fooling anyone.

274
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,200
Anyway, let's carry on and have a bit of a think about Germany.

275
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,880
So, Lauren has a few sources about Germany in her video description there.

276
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,760
This from Information Liberation.

277
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,840
Now, that's not true.

278
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,400
If they were born in Germany, they're German citizens.

279
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,680
They're not foreigners.

280
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,480
What you mean to say and what you're actually outraged about

281
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,880
is that those people might not be white.

282
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,760
I also like this picture here which has a bunch of smiling children waving the German flag

283
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,880
and this is supposed to be a bad thing somehow.

284
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,960
There's also this story from the Daily Mail.

285
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:45,120
And the top comment on this article is pretty funny.

286
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,280
Migrant background?

287
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,680
That could still mean they were born and raised in Germany,

288
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
speak German as their first language,

289
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,000
and are German citizens with no other allegiance.

290
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
Very misleading headline.

291
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,160
That comment is from Tommy there.

292
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,720
Not Robinson, I assume.

293
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,400
As a side note here, this article manages to spell the word integrate

294
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,280
three different ways in just two sentences,

295
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,520
which is impressive, to say the least.

296
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
Anyway, yes, Tommy's right.

297
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,360
People of a migrant background doesn't mean migrants.

298
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
It means people of a migrant background,

299
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,840
which depending on where you want to mark the cutoff point in history,

300
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,160
that could include any number of people.

301
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,760
Also, again, not that it matters, but like in the UK,

302
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,000
the majority of these migrants are from other European countries.

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,040
Quoting the article,

304
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,840
Turkish migrants are the largest non-German minority that are settled in Frankfurt,

305
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,160
accounting for 13% of the population.

306
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,440
A further 61% of residents who were born abroad

307
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
have come from other countries within the European Union.

308
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Lauren, again, doesn't mention this

309
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,960
because she's trying to mislead her audience about the race of the migrants.

310
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,920
You know, if the majority of them are other Europeans,

311
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,400
it ruins the white nationalist narrative.

312
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,000
There's another point here about the duration these migrants plan to stay,

313
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,600
because, of course, not all migrants are permanent migrants.

314
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,880
And looking again at Lauren's migration observatory source,

315
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,640
the share of immigrants planning to stay for shorter periods of one to two years

316
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,200
has increased since the 1990s,

317
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,640
with less than a third of incoming migrants planning to stay for a period of more than four years.

318
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,120
Lauren doesn't mention this and treats all migrants as though they are permanent migrants,

319
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,080
when the statistics just don't support this.

320
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,600
Anyway, let's move on and take a look at Lauren's main source,

321
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,960
which is this chap,

322
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,160
Renaud Camus.

323
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,920
Saying that wrong.

324
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,200
And let's have a little read of a WordPress blog post

325
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,240
written about Camus and his replacement theory.

326
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,200
That I found in Lauren's sources, by the way.

327
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,920
Firstly, there is no racial replacement in Europe,

328
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,760
as the immigrants are not numerous enough to change the color of the locals.

329
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,680
Secondly, if there is a cultural drift,

330
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,040
is that drift due to immigration or perhaps to globalization,

331
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,840
i.e. fashions and behaviors from around the world coming to our doorstep via the internet?

332
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,880
His views lead him to make two astonishing statements.

333
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,680
Firstly, he takes Israel as a positive example

334
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,680
that Europe should be well advised to imitate by remigrating foreigners

335
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,520
back to their country of origin.

336
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,320
This is funny when one knows that Mr. Camus' supporters are in fact anti-Zionists,

337
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,480
as anti-Semitism is now called among the thinking elite.

338
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,160
Secondly, he argues that Europeans should contribute significantly more

339
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,960
to the economic support and development in the third world,

340
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,800
and in particular Africa, basically paying them to stay home

341
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,280
rather than having them come and eat our food.

342
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,480
No one of a serious mind will give support to Renault Camus for these odd views.

343
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,840
Well.

344
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,160
And again, I didn't go looking for that source.

345
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,800
This is listed in the description of Lauren's video.

346
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,760
You can go and check.

347
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,280
So anyway, I have a pro-video-making tip for you, Lauren.

348
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,320
Maybe don't include links to articles that imply your main source is an irrational idiot.

349
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,920
I mean, what happened there?

350
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,240
Were there not enough positive articles about the guy

351
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
so you had to include ones that dunk on him for being a moron?

352
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,720
I don't know.

353
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,120
So anyway, that WordPress blog was right.

354
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Camus' plan to deal with the migrants is to re-migrate them,

355
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
i.e. ship them all back home.

356
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,720
In an article on Free West Media, Camus says,

357
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,120
The means and ends are one and the same.

358
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,240
Remigration.

359
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,920
The return of the conquering peoples to their own lands.

360
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
Conquering peoples.

361
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,440
So, okay, very sorry to everyone in the US and Canada,

362
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,000
but you're gonna have to move back to Europe.

363
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
Which is a bit concerning, to be perfectly honest.

364
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,680
I don't know where we're gonna put you all.

365
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,680
Of course, Camus probably doesn't mean this.

366
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,800
The arbitrary line he's drawn in history for when we need to stop migration and ship everyone back

367
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,040
is probably not gonna have to include any white people being shipped anywhere.

368
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,640
It's funny how that works, isn't it?

369
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,280
Also, Camus' plan wouldn't work.

370
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,560
Quite aside from the fact that it is literally impossible

371
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,120
to just ship every descendant of a migrant back to where they came from,

372
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,520
his measures don't go far enough to stop what he wants to stop.

373
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
Let's consider the world as a whole.

374
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,680
You know, there's no migration to the world, is there?

375
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,880
That we know about, anyway.

376
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,600
And now let's imagine that all birth rates were equal across every group and type of person.

377
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,720
So exactly equal birth rates for everyone.

378
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,160
And let's say that they're exactly at replacement levels everywhere,

379
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,400
so every country and race has a completely stable population.

380
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Now then, what you would still see is the white population

381
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,760
declining as a percentage of the whole over time.

382
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,800
And why is that?

383
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,520
Well, it's because of how we classify whiteness.

384
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,200
Barack Obama, for instance, is seen as a black man,

385
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,560
despite having one black and one white parent.

386
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,160
Do you see my point here, any racist folk who are watching?

387
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,280
Immigration and birth rates don't matter.

388
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Because of how we classify races,

389
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,560
to maintain the white population as the same percentage of the whole,

390
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,520
you would have to either ban interracial relationships

391
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,600
or introduce measures to reduce the birth rates of non-white people.

392
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,040
That is the only logical endpoint of what you're proposing.

393
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,960
And I imagine someone might say,

394
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,400
wait, but I'm not talking about race, I'm talking about culture and heritage.

395
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
Yeah, rubbish.

396
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
But admittedly, there is one aspect of this that isn't racial.

397
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,160
There is also a religious element to consider.

398
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,880
Trends in Europe tell the same overall story.

399
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,680
As the native European population dies out,

400
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,480
migrant and Muslim populations are rapidly growing,

401
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,600
with higher birth rates and unfettered mass immigration.

402
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,200
And with the median age of 32 for Muslims in Europe,

403
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
eight years younger than for all Europeans,

404
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,040
five years younger for the religiously unaffiliated,

405
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,000
and ten years younger for the European Christians,

406
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,720
the future of Europe looks pretty halal.

407
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,160
Now, sorry, Lauren, again, that's not true.

408
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,400
For a start, Camus states,

409
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,320
the great replacement is very simple.

410
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,680
You have one people, and in the space of our generation,

411
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,040
you have a different people.

412
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,160
The space of one generation.

413
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,200
So, how fast is the Muslim population in Europe actually growing?

414
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
Well, according to another link in Lauren's description,

415
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,520
by 2050, the population of Europe that is Muslim will be 10%.

416
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,320
Ten percent.

417
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,040
So, in 2050, I will be, for example, 62 years old.

418
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,480
So when exactly am I supposed to be replaced?

419
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,520
You know, you're telling me that if we don't act now,

420
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,840
then in 33 years, assuming current data trends hold, remember,

421
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,120
we'll still outnumber Muslims 9 to 1.

422
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,280
You know, excuse me if I don't throw myself out the window and panic here, Lauren.

423
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,560
The future of Europe looks pretty halal actually means

424
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:05,200
that in several decades, they will just about be 10% of the population.

425
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,120
And I can extrapolate data trends into the future too, as it turns out.

426
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,920
The Muslim population of Europe as a percentage of the whole

427
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,520
has been increasing by about 1% per decade.

428
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,680
So for a clear majority, after they hit 10% in 2050,

429
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,920
we'll just have to wait for around 40 decades, which is 400 years.

430
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,080
So act now, people of Europe.

431
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,880
We're in the year 2500.

432
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,800
We're really gonna be in trouble.

433
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,200
We'll have hover mosques or something.

434
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,400
Muslims flying around in little Jetsons cars.

435
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,440
Anyway, so let's talk about how this happened.

436
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,360
One of the biggest things that we can attribute to the cause of the great replacement

437
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,080
is Western ethno-masochism.

438
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,720
Basically, white people hate themselves.

439
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,760
And if you look at groups like Antifa or even just

440
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,720
your average college student or state broadcasters,

441
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,320
many white people feel that replacing themselves will relieve guilt of past crimes.

442
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,800
So unlike almost every other culture in the world that wants to preserve itself

443
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,240
and remain homogenous, Europeans actively invite the destruction of their tradition.

444
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,800
So Lauren says this is happening because white people hate themselves

445
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,840
and actively want their countries to be destroyed.

446
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,400
And it's a clever framing of the argument there.

447
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,720
You know, this bad thing is definitely happening and everyone agrees it is,

448
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,680
but some people just want it to happen, you know.

449
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,160
Well, speaking as a white man here, Lauren, I don't hate white people.

450
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,360
And I don't want my country to be destroyed.

451
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,840
But I still disagree with you because I think you're wrong.

452
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,680
You've tied culture and national identity to race.

453
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,680
And that's bullshit.

454
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,960
You don't have to be white to be a British person

455
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,120
or an American person or a German person and so on.

456
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,680
Insisting that the racial makeups of these countries is something to be concerned about

457
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,720
is just incorrect conspiracy theory racist nonsense.

458
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,520
Consider this.

459
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,760
In the last century, which of the following actually nearly destroyed Europe?

460
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,120
Was it immigrants and people who aren't white?

461
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,920
Or was it what Lauren would call a national identitarian movement

462
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,840
concerned about minorities changing the culture of their country?

463
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,080
Answers on a postcard, thanks.

464
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
And I'd like to address something else.

465
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,760
Lauren thinks that immigration and cultural change represent the death of tradition.

466
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,880
I disagree.

467
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
I think it is our tradition.

468
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,560
It's one of the traditions that's worth preserving.

469
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,440
When I think about great things my country has done,

470
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,680
the first thing that comes to mind is oppose the Nazis.

471
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,280
And we didn't do that alone.

472
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,480
Like, the RAF, for instance, fighting the Battle of Britain

473
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,320
had refugee pilots from all over Europe fighting in it.

474
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,360
And we also have a history of taking in migrants, sometimes huge amounts of migrants.

475
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,560
Let me talk about my own city for a little bit.

476
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,920
While the Irish Potato Famine was going on,

477
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,080
about a million Irish people emigrated out of Ireland in a relatively very short period of time.

478
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,360
And Liverpool, being a port city close to Ireland, is where a lot of those people ended up.

479
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,320
By 1851, about a quarter of Liverpool's population was Irish-born.

480
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,200
And that's born in Ireland, not descended from Irish people or whatever.

481
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,080
And I'm sure if we had YouTube back then, we'd have people proclaiming the doom of the country.

482
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,960
You know, all these Irish people will breed like rabbits.

483
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,520
They're all poor. They're a drain on the state.

484
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,040
They don't have jobs.

485
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,600
They're gonna out-breed us and take over.

486
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,720
Which, you know, it didn't happen, did it?

487
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,240
And now, someone might say,

488
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,640
well, Irish people aren't like today's immigrants.

489
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,080
They were able to integrate.

490
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
Sorry, integrate?

491
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,480
They integrated just fine.

492
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,440
No troubles there.

493
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,440
Troubles.

494
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,000
Do you get it?

495
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,560
You know, it's not like there'd ever be any Irish terrorists, would there?

496
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,000
It's not like Irish terrorists would set off the most powerful bomb

497
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,440
detonated in Great Britain since World War II, is it?

498
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,360
It's not like any Irish people would ever launch a mortar attack on Downing Street

499
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,240
in order to assassinate the Prime Minister, is it?

500
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,040
That's all true, by the way.

501
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,760
And now, a few decades later, nobody really cares.

502
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,880
You know, nobody is fretting about Irish birth rates.

503
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,000
No one's crossing the road or getting off a bus when they hear an Irish accent, are they?

504
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,880
Not many people in Britain are all that fussed anymore.

505
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,160
And I wonder why that is.

506
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,440
Not really.

507
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
Again, it's because they're white.

508
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,240
But what's my point here, really?

509
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,440
Well, Lauren, with regards to the whole white genocide thing,

510
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
just don't worry about it, you know?

511
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,320
Demographic change is inevitable.

512
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,480
It will happen, regardless of what you do.

513
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,440
It's not a matter of fighting it or not.

514
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
It can't be fought.

515
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,000
It's just what happens.

516
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,680
It's what's always happened.

517
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,600
And it's nothing to worry about.

518
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,760
And it won't be as bad as you think, anyway.

519
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,440
By the way, it won't be bad at all, of course, in any regard,

520
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,200
but I'm trying to speak her language here.

521
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,800
You see, birth rates are falling everywhere.

522
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,160
With medical advancements, less people need it for farming,

523
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,240
you know, more people living in cities,

524
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,600
a greater chance of kids living to see adulthood and so on,

525
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
fewer children are being born.

526
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,680
But this is happening globally.

527
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,360
I've mentioned this in another video,

528
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,200
but birth rates in predominantly Muslim countries are also falling.

529
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,400
Recent migrant populations might have more kids than the average in the country they've moved to,

530
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,400
but that's a mix of being generally poorer than the native population,

531
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,880
which resolves itself within a few generations,

532
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,560
and cultural norms,

533
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,320
which also even out after a couple of generations, by and large.

534
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
You know, anyone looking into the future

535
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,280
and trying to predict what different birth rates will be like in 2070 or something,

536
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,360
well, it's a fool's errand.

537
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,480
We don't know.

538
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,560
And I'd like to leave you all with a brief thought

539
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,920
about the white fear of becoming a minority.

540
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,800
And I'll say this to any fellow worried white people.

541
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
You are already a minority.

542
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,560
You're a minority in lots of ways,

543
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,600
many of which might seem trivial to you right now,

544
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,280
but what happens when a Nazi-like party comes to power

545
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,720
and starts again judging people by nose length,

546
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,680
or eye color, or skull shape?

547
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,520
You know, don't start hating on minorities in order to prevent becoming one,

548
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
because you already are,

549
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
so just get used to it, I guess.

550
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,960
And chill out.

551
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,960
Thanks for watching, everyone.

552
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,320
This Rome video is never gonna come out, is it?

553
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Sorry, my fault, I keep getting distracted.

554
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,200
I should just completely log off the internet until it's done now.

555
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,120
Thanks as always to my supporters over on Patreon,

556
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,320
who almost literally put food in my mouth.

557
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,360
I love them all,

558
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,960
and I hope they all get exactly what they want for their birthdays.

559
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,520
And if you would like to be similarly complimented,

560
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,680
consider supporting me yourself.

561
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,760
It's positively exciting.

562
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,040
Also follow me on Twitter if you feel like.

563
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,160
Righty-ho, folks.

564
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,200
I'll see you soon.
