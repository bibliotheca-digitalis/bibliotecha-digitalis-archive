00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
Hello, everyone. Now, before we get started with the video today,

00:03.440 --> 00:07.920
I'm gonna have to include a brief note about the concept of guilt by association.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.800
Now, let's say, for instance, I work in an office,

00:10.800 --> 00:14.320
and a colleague of mine is photographed kicking a cat.

00:14.320 --> 00:18.320
Say, now it would be unfair to also declare me guilty of that crime

00:18.320 --> 00:22.720
simply for being associated in an unrelated way with the perpetrator.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.720
However, let's say an associate of mine is photographed kicking a cat,

00:26.800 --> 00:31.360
only this time we're associated because he attends my cat kicking course,

00:31.360 --> 00:34.560
where I teach the most effective ways to kick cats.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.520
That wouldn't merely be guilt by association, then,

00:37.520 --> 00:42.800
because the way in which I was associated with him would have a direct link to his actions.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.480
That's just something I think it's important to make clear at the start here,

00:46.480 --> 00:49.360
and you'll hopefully see why this was needed as we go on.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.640
Anyway, hello, everyone, again.

00:52.640 --> 00:57.760
This is a video about terms like white supremacist, white nationalist, and racist,

00:57.760 --> 01:01.040
and it's also a response to a video posted by Steven Crowder

01:01.040 --> 01:03.840
on the 30th of April this year entitled,

01:03.840 --> 01:05.920
What Is White Supremacy?

01:05.920 --> 01:09.360
In that video, Steven is worried about an apparent uncertainty

01:09.360 --> 01:13.440
over who counts as a white nationalist or white supremacist or racist,

01:13.440 --> 01:17.120
and he's furthermore worried that this confusion will lead to people being banned

01:17.120 --> 01:22.400
from various social media sites merely by being accused of belonging to those groups.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.280
As always, I'd suggest you watch his video first,

01:25.280 --> 01:28.480
so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his views.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.280
But we'll also briefly talk through Steven's argument here

01:31.280 --> 01:34.320
before we get into responding to specific sections of it.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.920
So, okay, Steven opens his video with a flash-forward plea

01:37.920 --> 01:42.160
to various social media tech CEOs asking them to define the terms

01:42.160 --> 01:44.640
white supremacy and white nationalism,

01:44.640 --> 01:48.720
and asks what should count as a bannable offense on social media.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.800
Steven then says he's against various recent white nationalist terror attacks.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.720
That's good.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.080
But then starts complaining about people politicizing the murders,

01:58.080 --> 02:00.640
quote, before the bodies are even cold.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.400
Which is always a silly thing to say,

02:02.400 --> 02:06.000
because terror attacks are explicitly political by nature.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.760
You can't politicize them. They're already political.

02:09.760 --> 02:10.480
Anyway.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.080
Steven then complains about various news shows in the United States

02:14.080 --> 02:15.920
calling President Trump a racist,

02:15.920 --> 02:18.720
and then moves on to complain about journalists in the media

02:18.720 --> 02:21.520
apparently calling all manner of people who disagree with them

02:21.520 --> 02:23.600
white supremacists or white nationalists,

02:23.600 --> 02:26.640
including media figures like himself and Ben Shapiro.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.120
He says that by the time we get to this, quote,

02:29.120 --> 02:33.520
actual white supremacist, the term has lost all meaning.

02:33.520 --> 02:38.080
Now, you might note here that corporate news journalists calling the president racist

02:38.080 --> 02:41.280
have nothing at all to do with suspected white supremacists

02:41.280 --> 02:43.840
being banned from social media websites.

02:43.840 --> 02:48.000
To the uninitiated, this leap of logic will seem rather confusing.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.480
But the actual reason for why Steven can do this

02:50.480 --> 02:54.640
is that the point of his show is to argue against what he calls the left.

02:54.640 --> 02:59.760
Which, for him, includes not just actual leftists, but also liberals.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.280
Now, he's not able to distinguish between those two groups, obviously.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.640
The Democratic Party establishments are also called the left,

03:06.640 --> 03:09.840
despite being rather strongly disliked by the left.

03:09.840 --> 03:16.080
And also, tech CEOs who run huge private corporations are also apparently the left.

03:16.080 --> 03:20.240
It's a ridiculous us-versus-them oversimplification, basically.

03:20.240 --> 03:24.960
If you can convince your audience that all these disparate groups count as the left,

03:24.960 --> 03:28.000
then manufacturing leftist hypocrisy is easy.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.720
The vast majority of the content on Steven's channel

03:30.720 --> 03:34.400
is centered around criticizing these air quotes leftists,

03:34.400 --> 03:38.560
even if the subject in question is a white nationalist mass murder.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.880
Top five dumbest leftist reactions to synagogue shooting

03:42.880 --> 03:46.240
is a real headline on their website, believe it or not.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.320
Anyway, back to the video in question.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.800
Steven then makes various comparative statements

03:50.800 --> 03:53.440
about the abilities of various races of people,

03:53.440 --> 03:58.160
and asks if saying those statements makes him a racist or a white supremacist.

03:58.160 --> 04:02.800
He then says that leftists are calling everything a white supremacist dog whistle,

04:02.800 --> 04:05.760
using clips of Donald Trump talking about choking

04:05.760 --> 04:08.640
and being accused of referencing the murder of Eric Garner,

04:08.640 --> 04:10.640
which happened five years ago.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.360
Steven doesn't pick a more recent or relevant example

04:13.360 --> 04:15.760
of a racist dog whistle for some reason.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.160
You can't use this one anymore, I guess.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.560
Steven then gives various comparative statements

04:20.560 --> 04:23.040
about different countries and societies,

04:23.040 --> 04:26.960
asking if saying those statements makes him a racist or a white supremacist.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.840
Now, if you noticed that this was the exact same point as the IQ thing earlier in the video,

04:32.400 --> 04:35.280
you're correct, it's not a very well-structured argument, this.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.200
Then he waffles about how great western civilization is for a while

04:39.200 --> 04:42.480
before closing out by saying that if social media platforms

04:42.480 --> 04:45.120
are gonna ban people for being white supremacists,

04:45.120 --> 04:47.760
then they have to define what white supremacy is.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.200
The end.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.360
Right, so what do we think about this video?

04:51.360 --> 04:52.560
Why was it made?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.880
Well, the description to the video says

04:54.880 --> 04:58.880
Steven Crowder thoroughly dissects media's use and misuse

04:58.880 --> 05:02.000
of the terms white supremacy and white nationalism,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.880
separating fact from liberal fiction.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.080
But he doesn't thoroughly dissect anything, of course.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.040
Once you strip out the regrettable celebrity impressions

05:11.040 --> 05:14.720
and complaining about irrelevant criticisms of Donald Trump,

05:14.720 --> 05:19.040
nearly all Steven says with regards to white nationalism and white supremacy is

05:19.040 --> 05:21.280
I don't know what they mean.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.760
Can somebody please help me?

05:23.760 --> 05:26.560
I say nearly because to be charitable to Steven,

05:26.560 --> 05:28.960
his one actual point appears to be

05:28.960 --> 05:32.320
there is some uncertainty about who is and isn't a white nationalist,

05:32.320 --> 05:34.400
white supremacist, racist, or whatever.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.800
And that uncertainty is the fault of the leftist hive mind

05:38.800 --> 05:42.000
for overusing those terms where they don't apply.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.520
So Steven wants someone on the left to tell him what those terms mean.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.760
So that's what we're gonna do today.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.880
We're gonna help Steven out and answer his questions.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.560
So we'll start with the basic definitions of the terms he's confused about.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.280
A white supremacist is someone who believes that white people

05:57.280 --> 06:00.880
are superior to people of other races and should be in control of them.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.320
A white nationalist is an advocate for enforced racial segregation

06:04.320 --> 06:07.040
with the aim of creating an ethnically white state.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.680
And a racist is someone who believes that a particular race

06:09.680 --> 06:11.760
is inherently superior to others.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.560
Now there's obviously a lot of crossover between those terms,

06:14.560 --> 06:17.360
but at least in dictionary definition form here,

06:17.360 --> 06:19.920
they aren't particularly confusing so far.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.800
Now I'd like to go off on a little tangent here if you'll let me.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.480
Well, you know, either way, you can't stop me.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.240
So I'm not here to debate whether any of these terms

06:30.240 --> 06:32.720
represent acceptable political positions.

06:33.280 --> 06:33.840
They don't.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.960
Here in the free marketplace of ideas,

06:36.960 --> 06:39.840
I will debate absolutely any argument or position,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.240
so long as it's debatable.

06:42.240 --> 06:46.240
For instance, I won't debate whether two plus two equals five with you.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.560
Not because I can't prove it doesn't,

06:48.560 --> 06:50.240
but because there's no point.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.760
It's a waste of time.

06:51.760 --> 06:55.040
You know, take someone who thinks that two plus two equals five

06:55.040 --> 06:56.400
and will argue the point.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.000
I don't want to convince them that they're wrong.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.680
I don't want them on my side.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.800
You know, if they looked at the evidence and came to that conclusion,

07:04.800 --> 07:06.480
who knows what else they think?

07:06.480 --> 07:07.440
They're embarrassing.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.560
Likewise with questions of equal rights.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.960
Whether or not people deserve equal human rights

07:12.960 --> 07:15.120
is a question with a right and a wrong answer

07:15.120 --> 07:17.520
as clear cut as the previous example.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.960
If you believe, for instance,

07:18.960 --> 07:21.680
that white people are inherently superior to other races

07:21.680 --> 07:25.360
and deserve to be treated preferentially by society as a result of that,

07:26.000 --> 07:27.200
you are wrong.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.880
There's nothing to be debated there.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.080
Not because I can't explain why you're wrong,

07:32.080 --> 07:34.080
but because as things stand,

07:34.080 --> 07:37.280
you're incapable of understanding why you're wrong.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.960
Anyway, tangent over.

07:38.960 --> 07:39.920
Now, as we've seen,

07:39.920 --> 07:43.040
Steven attributes the supposed ambiguity surrounding terms

07:43.040 --> 07:45.520
like white supremacist, white nationalist, and so on

07:45.520 --> 07:48.880
to leftist and or liberal overuse of the terms.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.920
But I'd like to offer an alternative explanation,

07:51.920 --> 07:54.800
something that Steven never considers in his video,

07:54.800 --> 07:55.520
and it's this.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.240
Sometimes, people lie.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.200
Now, that might sound shocking and unbelievable,

08:01.200 --> 08:02.400
but stick with me.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.840
Take this quote actual white supremacist

08:05.840 --> 08:07.920
who Steven calls a white supremacist.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.120
Now, is this really how obvious we need people to be

08:11.680 --> 08:14.320
before we'll call them a white supremacist?

08:14.320 --> 08:17.440
You know, you have to be at a white supremacist rally

08:17.440 --> 08:19.680
proudly showing off a swastika tattoo,

08:19.680 --> 08:21.200
because here's the thing.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.560
There could be people out there

08:22.560 --> 08:26.560
who have some or all of the same political opinions as this man,

08:26.560 --> 08:29.040
but who are savvy enough to know it's a bad idea

08:29.040 --> 08:31.040
to get a big swastika tattoo.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.520
Let's pretend, for the purposes of argument,

08:33.520 --> 08:35.200
that such people exist.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.680
Actually, we don't need to pretend that.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.160
Let's say you're Steven Crowder.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.000
Apologies.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.360
And you need a photograph of an actual white supremacist

08:45.360 --> 08:46.640
for your internet video.

08:46.640 --> 08:47.600
So what do you do?

08:47.600 --> 08:48.800
You go to Google Images,

08:48.800 --> 08:51.200
you type in actual white supremacist,

08:51.200 --> 08:52.560
and there he is there.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.160
Now, this photograph is of a man at the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally,

08:56.160 --> 08:58.080
and it's from a website that says,

08:58.080 --> 09:03.280
9% of Americans think it's okay to hold white supremacist or neo-Nazi views.

09:03.280 --> 09:07.040
A Washington Post ABC News poll found that 9% of Americans

09:07.040 --> 09:10.960
believe holding white supremacist or neo-Nazi views is acceptable.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.520
A majority of Americans, regardless of party,

09:13.520 --> 09:15.680
think it's unacceptable to hold such views.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.520
83% overall.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.240
So that's good.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.240
Most confusing to me here, though, is if we click through to the poll,

09:22.320 --> 09:27.520
the 8% of people who apparently have no opinion of neo-Nazi views at all.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.760
What's going on with them?

09:29.760 --> 09:34.080
Just sort of ambivalent, I guess, about the whole Nazism thing.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.960
Now, even if we assume that this study was wildly off,

09:36.960 --> 09:39.600
and 9% is a huge overestimation,

09:39.600 --> 09:44.960
if even 1% of the US population thought that holding neo-Nazi views was acceptable,

09:44.960 --> 09:47.760
that'd be more than 3 million people.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.920
Trust me, they are out there.

09:50.480 --> 09:55.120
You see, people who go to far-right rallies and wave swastika flags and do Hitler salutes,

09:55.120 --> 09:59.760
we can call them open white supremacists, nationalists, racists, and whatever.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.960
But what we also have to be concerned about are people who agree with this man,

10:04.960 --> 10:09.600
who themselves are white supremacists and nationalists and racists and so on,

10:09.600 --> 10:11.920
but who say that they aren't.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.720
Now, there are some people in the right-wing media sphere

10:14.720 --> 10:18.080
who are open white nationalists or supremacists,

10:18.080 --> 10:20.480
but usually they don't get all that much of an audience

10:20.480 --> 10:23.200
because those ideas phrased as clearly as that

10:23.200 --> 10:25.920
mean you're very likely to eventually either get fired

10:25.920 --> 10:28.320
or banned off whatever sites you're using.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.760
Much more common than them are closeted white nationalists

10:31.760 --> 10:34.960
who hide behind euphemisms for their actual beliefs.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.480
They might say, you know,

10:36.480 --> 10:39.520
I'm not a white nationalist, I'm an identitarian.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.880
I'm not a racist, I'm a race realist, and so on.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.240
They'll say they disavow Nazism and white supremacy,

10:46.240 --> 10:48.480
but they're saying that for branding reasons

10:48.480 --> 10:51.600
rather than actual ideological disagreements.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.840
They do support white nationalism,

10:53.840 --> 10:57.280
but they understand that saying so would damage their cause.

10:57.280 --> 11:02.000
So to advance white nationalism, they have to first pretend to disavow it.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.840
And then separate from that group, there are some pure shameless grifters

11:05.840 --> 11:07.520
with no real opinions of their own,

11:07.520 --> 11:10.800
but who have worked out that there's a lot of money and attention to be had

11:10.800 --> 11:12.800
in pandering to racists.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.520
And now, what's the difference between all these groups of people

11:15.600 --> 11:21.120
the, quote, real white nationalists, the closeted white nationalists, and the panderers?

11:21.120 --> 11:24.560
Well, functionally, as far as I'm concerned, nothing.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.480
They're all spreading the same propaganda.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.840
It doesn't matter what they call it or their reason for doing it.

11:29.840 --> 11:33.600
If you associate with and support racists and parrot their opinions,

11:34.240 --> 11:39.440
you're a racist, regardless of if you say or even think you are.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.080
Now, does thinking this mean I'll sometimes label someone

11:42.080 --> 11:44.080
a white nationalist or racist or whatever

11:44.080 --> 11:45.680
who claims not to be one?

11:46.480 --> 11:48.800
Sure. Do I care about that?

11:49.520 --> 11:50.640
Not really.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.120
You know, in my opinion, the burden of proof is on them

11:53.120 --> 11:55.440
to act less like a white nationalist.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.080
And for any fans of Steven Crowder who might be watching

11:58.080 --> 12:00.320
who think I'm being unfair here,

12:00.320 --> 12:03.920
consider the following clip from another of his videos.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.440
So they don't believe in the First Amendment,

12:05.440 --> 12:08.240
whereas white nationalists, when we address the Constitution,

12:08.240 --> 12:10.960
don't believe that all people were created equal.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.680
If you look at the Declaration of Independence, that's right in there.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.720
They don't believe that.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.840
They all agree on one thing.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.480
Equality is a dangerous myth.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.800
The alt-right is united in rejecting the current dogma

12:24.800 --> 12:26.960
that all races are equal.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.360
And I know people say he's alt-right.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.880
That's- he's a white nationalist.

12:31.520 --> 12:35.520
So who is this guy who Steven called alt-right and a white nationalist?

12:35.520 --> 12:37.280
Well, that's Jared Taylor,

12:37.280 --> 12:41.040
editor of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance.

12:41.040 --> 12:45.840
Jared Taylor is a white supremacist and white nationalist and racist.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.200
And Steven Crowder was correct to identify him as such.

12:49.760 --> 12:53.120
However, Taylor has been described as a white nationalist,

12:53.120 --> 12:55.840
white supremacist, and racist by civil rights groups,

12:55.840 --> 12:59.120
news media, academics studying racism in the US, and others.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.280
Many sources.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.720
Taylor has strenuously rejected being called a racist

13:04.720 --> 13:09.920
and maintains that he is instead a racialist who believes in race realism.

13:09.920 --> 13:10.720
That's a good one.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.920
He's also said that he's not a white supremacist,

13:13.920 --> 13:16.560
describing himself as a white advocate,

13:16.560 --> 13:20.000
and contends that his views on nationality and race are moderate,

13:20.000 --> 13:24.400
commonsensical, and fully consistent with the views of most of the great statesmen

13:24.400 --> 13:26.320
and presidents of America's past.

13:26.320 --> 13:29.760
Yeah, mainly the ones who own slaves, I think you'll find.

13:29.760 --> 13:30.960
Well, what's my point here?

13:30.960 --> 13:35.200
Well, Steven Crowder clearly has no objection to calling a racist a racist

13:35.200 --> 13:37.680
when he believes the term to be accurate,

13:37.680 --> 13:41.840
even if they themselves would prefer the term racialist or whatever else.

13:41.840 --> 13:45.200
He feels entitled to make that judgment call there,

13:45.200 --> 13:49.520
and that's the same judgment call he's criticizing those on the left for making.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.520
Now, given that Steven, in his video,

13:51.520 --> 13:56.240
complains about people calling him a white supremacist or nationalist or whatever,

13:56.240 --> 13:59.440
let's take a look at some possible reasons that might be.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.160
And we'll stick with Jared Taylor here for a second.

14:02.160 --> 14:06.960
So, we have on the line, and I guess for those of you video-based,

14:06.960 --> 14:08.720
on the screen, Jared Taylor.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.520
Now, Jared Taylor is the editor of American Renaissance,

14:11.520 --> 14:13.440
the president of the New Century Foundation,

14:13.440 --> 14:16.720
and the author of many books on race relations.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.400
We're going to put links to those below.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.440
I highly recommend them.

14:19.440 --> 14:24.800
It's very data-driven, not ideological, very fact-based, and very eye-opening.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.360
It's sort of chilling when you realize the degree to which essential information

14:29.360 --> 14:33.040
for the improvement of race relations is kept hidden from people.

14:33.040 --> 14:38.080
And the New Century Foundation recently released an updated version of,

14:38.080 --> 14:39.520
I guess you could call it a pamphlet,

14:39.520 --> 14:42.480
but a very data-driven presentation on the color of crime.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.720
It's a report on differences in crime rates by race,

14:45.280 --> 14:48.720
an examination of questions of bias in the justice system,

14:48.720 --> 14:51.440
and, of course, interracial crime statistics.

14:52.720 --> 14:56.960
So, that clip was of Jared Taylor being featured on Stefan Molyneux's YouTube channel,

14:56.960 --> 14:59.520
with Stefan sharing Taylor's work with his audience

14:59.520 --> 15:02.480
and linking in the description to his various websites.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.880
Now, Stefan Molyneux is a white nationalist,

15:04.880 --> 15:07.600
or at least a white nationalist sympathizer,

15:07.600 --> 15:12.160
coming out as such in a documentary about a trip to Poland he made late last year.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.360
First of all, I've always been skeptical of the ideas

15:15.360 --> 15:19.680
of white nationalism, of identitarianism, and white identity.

15:20.640 --> 15:25.120
However, I am an empiricist, and I could not help but notice

15:25.760 --> 15:32.400
that I could have peaceful, free, easy, civilized, and safe discussions

15:32.400 --> 15:35.280
in what is essentially an all-white country.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.440
I've spoken out against white nationalism, but I'm an empiricist.

15:43.200 --> 15:43.920
I'm listening.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.600
I'm listening to my experiences, can't argue with the facts.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.000
So, that's pretty blatant there.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.840
He does do the whole, of course,

15:51.840 --> 15:54.800
I've always been very skeptical of white nationalism routine,

15:54.800 --> 15:57.680
so we can back away from it later if he's called out.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.840
It's a wordier version of, I'm not a racist, but, you know.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.920
He also calls himself an empiricist,

16:03.920 --> 16:06.800
and then offers only anecdotal evidence for now thinking

16:06.800 --> 16:09.600
that white nationalism is good, which is pretty funny.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.680
So, why am I talking about Stefan Molyneux?

16:11.680 --> 16:15.840
Well, if we can't always trust what people say when they tell us who they are,

16:15.840 --> 16:20.480
how can we tell who is a white nationalist, or racist, or whatever else?

16:20.480 --> 16:26.160
Well, we can ask ourselves, what sorts of things would we see a secret racist do?

16:26.160 --> 16:29.040
Well, how about platform other racists,

16:29.040 --> 16:33.200
and sell their work to your audience to financially support them?

16:33.200 --> 16:36.080
And following on from that, Stefan Molyneux has been a guest

16:36.080 --> 16:38.240
on Steven Crowder's show multiple times,

16:38.240 --> 16:41.120
and here's a clip of Molyneux advertising a book he wrote

16:41.120 --> 16:43.360
on Steven Crowder's YouTube channel.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.680
So, a note for YouTubers here.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.920
Even if you totally disagree with someone,

16:47.920 --> 16:51.920
and were planning to completely destroy them in debate with facts and logic,

16:52.560 --> 16:54.480
you don't need to do this.

16:54.480 --> 16:58.080
You know, have them on the show and let them advertise their merch.

16:58.640 --> 17:03.120
You can debate Stefan Molyneux's opinions without once involving him.

17:03.120 --> 17:08.240
This is never necessary, unless your goal is to support him financially.

17:08.240 --> 17:11.360
So anyway, Steven calls Taylor a white nationalist,

17:11.360 --> 17:14.880
but supports Stefan Molyneux financially and shares his work,

17:14.880 --> 17:18.240
who then supports Taylor financially and shares his work.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.880
The link from Steven Crowder to someone Steven Crowder considers a white nationalist

17:22.880 --> 17:26.080
consists of one other white nationalist there.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.560
Let's not draw any premature conclusions here, though.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.160
Let's be a little more thorough.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.200
So, okay.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.560
The next behavior we might see a secret racist engage in

17:34.560 --> 17:38.320
is downplaying the danger of white supremacy and white nationalism.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.520
You know, you could say, I disavow it, of course,

17:41.520 --> 17:43.760
but it's not really that big of a deal, is it?

17:44.400 --> 17:46.800
What do you make of the whole white supremacy thing?

17:46.800 --> 17:49.760
The idea that we even have to talk about this seems sort of ridiculous.

17:49.760 --> 17:54.000
I just don't think, yes, I think there are some white supremacists,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.680
as there always have been.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.680
I don't think that there are Nazis running around.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.960
Nazis were a political party in Germany in the 1930s.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.160
They're not really running around now.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.920
Yeah, and like half the people on sites like Stormfront are feds.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.720
Like, it's a big joke online.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.400
If you go, I spend a lot of time like in tons of different political communities,

18:12.400 --> 18:13.760
on Facebook, just like reading it.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.400
And if you go into any alt-right Facebook groups,

18:16.400 --> 18:19.760
the joke is always if you post anything super Nazi or anything,

18:19.760 --> 18:21.680
they're like, oh, fed, are you a fed, right?

18:22.480 --> 18:24.080
They're like, no one does that in real life.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.240
No one runs around with Nazi tattoos in real life.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.040
You don't see it.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.320
That's Dave Rubin and Lauren Southern there,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.960
asking where on earth all the Nazis are

18:32.960 --> 18:36.720
just a few months prior to the Unite the Right rally at Charlottesville.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.320
You don't see people with swastika tattoos running around anymore.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.720
Oh, no, there they are, there.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.240
And they killed someone.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.800
We don't know what we're talking about, clearly.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.560
We were fatally incorrect.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.160
We apologize and quit because we're obviously incompetent.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.640
Now, that's my own fantasy.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.280
There, I should make clear they didn't actually say that.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.920
So how does this relate to Steven Crowder's video?

18:59.920 --> 19:02.960
Well, firstly, his own website goes in pretty hard

19:02.960 --> 19:05.360
on the Unite the Right attendees and organizers.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.560
It here calls them the Charlottesville supremacists.

19:08.560 --> 19:13.200
It calls Richard Spencer an asshole and an unapologetic white supremacist

19:13.200 --> 19:16.320
and refers to his smug little Nazi face.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.880
That article was shared by Steven Crowder on Twitter,

19:18.880 --> 19:21.040
so we can assume he agrees with those statements.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.520
So, okay, Steven Crowder has identified a Unite the Right attendee

19:25.520 --> 19:27.520
as an actual white supremacist

19:27.520 --> 19:31.440
and ran an article that called the organizer of the event a smug Nazi.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.280
All good so far.

19:34.160 --> 19:37.920
Returning to Lauren Southern, however, she would appear to disagree.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.960
Well, you would agree that some of it exists, right?

19:40.960 --> 19:43.200
Like, there's something there somewhere, that's right.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.280
Yeah, even the Richard Spencers of the world,

19:45.280 --> 19:49.440
like, even them, they're kind of misrepresented as well.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.560
Like, Richard Spencer is not a white supremacist.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.760
He is a white nationalist.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.360
He believes in a white ethnostate.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.920
He doesn't believe in whites being superior.

19:57.920 --> 20:02.000
So Richard Spencer is not a white supremacist, apparently.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.640
He's a white nationalist, according to Lauren Southern.

20:05.520 --> 20:06.400
However...

20:06.400 --> 20:08.400
And I don't identify as a white nationalist,

20:08.400 --> 20:11.280
just to, you know, let that be known.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.760
History is often a zero-sum game.

20:13.760 --> 20:17.360
History is often about subordination and domination.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.160
And it's about patronage and so on.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.000
And if we want to try to get away from that

20:22.000 --> 20:23.920
in order to be ideologically pure,

20:23.920 --> 20:26.640
like, oh, every ethnicity will have its little state,

20:26.640 --> 20:28.080
we're not going to really go anywhere.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.840
So why would Lauren Southern lie about Richard Spencer's views?

20:32.480 --> 20:37.360
Well, because she's trying to downplay the seriousness and danger of white supremacy,

20:37.360 --> 20:40.000
because that furthers her political goals.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.120
If more people believe there are no more white supremacists,

20:43.120 --> 20:47.040
that's fewer people who could recognize her as a white supremacist.

20:47.040 --> 20:50.480
You see, Lauren Southern pals around with various, air-quote,

20:50.480 --> 20:52.320
identitarian groups,

20:52.320 --> 20:56.800
most famously to interfere with migrant rescue operations in the Mediterranean.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.480
She shared false information about the Quebec City mosque shooting on Twitter,

21:00.480 --> 21:03.440
incorrectly identifying the shooters as Syrian refugees

21:03.440 --> 21:05.920
when it was actually a far-right white nationalist.

21:05.920 --> 21:10.880
She made a video popularizing the white supremacist Great Replacement conspiracy theory,

21:10.880 --> 21:14.720
the same conspiracy theory that inspired the Christchurch mosque shootings

21:14.720 --> 21:17.040
that killed more than 50 people in New Zealand.

21:17.040 --> 21:21.120
The shooter titled his manifesto The Great Replacement, even.

21:21.760 --> 21:26.160
And Lauren Southern is a frequent guest on Steven Crowder's show.

21:26.160 --> 21:30.720
So again, we have someone who all but calls themselves a white nationalist,

21:30.720 --> 21:34.240
who downplays the existence of Nazis and white supremacists

21:34.240 --> 21:36.960
while sharing their conspiracy theories,

21:36.960 --> 21:39.360
being supported by Steven Crowder.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.800
But again, let's not jump the gun here, we'll keep going.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.400
So this is Milo Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart contributor

21:46.400 --> 21:50.400
who was fired from everything after he said child abuse was okay.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.600
Here he is serenading a bunch of neo-Nazis in a bar,

21:53.680 --> 21:56.400
including Richard Spencer throwing a Hitler salute.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.440
Now in 2017, a bunch of Breitbart emails were leaked,

21:59.440 --> 22:03.840
which included, among other things, a leak of Milo's password for his email account,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.720
which was Long Knives 1290.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.360
Now that's a reference to both the Night of the Long Knives,

22:09.360 --> 22:12.160
which was a Nazi purge carried out by Adolf Hitler,

22:12.160 --> 22:14.880
and the 1290 Edict of Expulsion,

22:14.880 --> 22:18.160
a royal decree issued by King Edward I of England,

22:18.160 --> 22:20.800
expelling all the Jews from his kingdom.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.560
Well, you know the punchline by now.

22:22.560 --> 22:26.640
Milo Yiannopoulos has appeared several times on Steven Crowder's show.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.040
Moving on, this chap is Gavin McInnes,

22:29.040 --> 22:31.760
founder of the far-right gang The Proud Boys.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.360
And this is an easy one.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.800
Here's a clip of Gavin McInnes calling himself anti-Semitic

22:36.800 --> 22:39.200
and sympathizing with Holocaust deniers.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.160
This is basically a brainwashing trip.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.440
I mean, I think the Israeli government paid for this,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.200
and we had donors too, but I think they were mostly Israelis

22:49.200 --> 22:52.880
that assume that we're going to listen to all this shit, we get fed.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.120
And that is having the reverse effect on me.

22:57.120 --> 23:00.800
I'm becoming anti-Semitic, like at the Holocaust Museum,

23:01.680 --> 23:04.160
or as I call it, the Holocaust Museum.

23:04.160 --> 23:04.880
No, I'm just kidding.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.480
Yeah, like at one point the tour guide goes,

23:08.480 --> 23:11.040
you know, and there are people who think that this didn't happen.

23:11.680 --> 23:17.520
And I felt myself defending the super far-right Nazis,

23:17.520 --> 23:20.080
just because I was sick of being so much brainwashing,

23:20.080 --> 23:24.080
and I felt like going, well, they never said it didn't happen.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.040
What they're saying is that it was much less than six million,

23:27.040 --> 23:30.880
and that they starved to death and they weren't gassed,

23:30.880 --> 23:33.040
that they didn't have supplies.

23:33.040 --> 23:37.440
Notice how Gavin downplays the actual beliefs of Holocaust deniers there,

23:37.440 --> 23:41.440
because of course there are people who think the entire Holocaust was a hoax,

23:41.440 --> 23:46.080
including Andrew Anglin from the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer,

23:46.080 --> 23:48.080
who wrote about this clip saying,

23:48.080 --> 23:51.920
I completely 100% endorse these statements.

23:51.920 --> 23:55.200
Obviously I disagree with the Holocaust happened part,

23:55.200 --> 23:57.600
but we can't really expect him not to say that

23:57.600 --> 24:00.400
while he's literally still in Israel filming this.

24:00.400 --> 24:04.720
Everything else is totally and completely on point and awesome,

24:04.720 --> 24:07.280
which is not a sentence you want The Daily Stormer

24:07.280 --> 24:10.000
to ever say about any of your opinions.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.080
Gavin McInnes also wrote about Richard Spencer back in 2016 saying,

24:14.080 --> 24:18.560
I've known alt-right pioneer Richard Spencer since he got me the job at this magazine,

24:18.560 --> 24:24.000
and even he, the head of the snake, comes across as perfectly reasonable in conversation.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.680
He doesn't think non-whites can be included in a harmonious America,

24:30.480 --> 24:30.980
but...

24:33.280 --> 24:36.080
everything else on his plate is relatively civil.

24:36.080 --> 24:39.680
Gavin McInnes has also provided a platform to Jared Taylor.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.640
The main researcher on this is Edward Rubenstein.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.760
He's a very well-known economist and researcher.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.240
He did a really fantastic, thorough job.

24:48.240 --> 24:48.740
So...

24:48.740 --> 24:51.040
Sounds like, uh, hee-hee!

24:52.240 --> 24:54.240
What's this?

24:54.560 --> 24:57.760
That's my, uh, Jew, uh, finger thing.

24:57.760 --> 25:03.120
And of course, Gavin McInnes is a frequent contributor to Steven Crowder's show.

25:03.120 --> 25:07.520
All right, next up we have Owen Benjamin, who is a comedian, apparently.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.960
Now, Owen has been on Steven Crowder's show multiple times,

25:10.960 --> 25:15.440
even filling in as host of the show when Steven Crowder wasn't available.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.880
So you'd imagine he's a pretty trusted person around those parts

25:18.880 --> 25:21.200
if they let him in the driver's seat, right?

25:21.200 --> 25:26.720
Now, Owen Benjamin also does his own internet web streams on YouTube,

25:26.720 --> 25:29.520
and let's take a peek at one of those.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.040
But it wasn't gas chambers.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.760
It wasn't extermination based on race.

25:33.760 --> 25:39.440
What if it literally was work will set you free work, motherfucker,

25:40.000 --> 25:40.720
and they died?

25:42.160 --> 25:44.400
That's infinitely more probable.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.400
If you're a dictator, right?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.120
Why would you kill your slaves?

25:49.120 --> 25:51.680
Well, I have another artist that I'm a big fan of.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.180
Hitler.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.840
He was a great artist.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.200
He was also a great writer.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.880
Mein Kampf and all his paintings.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.080
Really, what he was trying to do is clean Germany.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.560
Clean it of the parasites, of the fleas.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.480
He was not, he did not hate Jews.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.440
He hated filth.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.880
And he was trying to clean up.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.920
And I'm not sure there's much I need to say about that.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.640
So, to Steven Crowder, I'll say this.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.680
If you want people to not call you a racist,

26:15.680 --> 26:19.520
maybe stop inviting racists onto your YouTube show that you do.

26:19.520 --> 26:24.560
And if you're confused about who is and is not a white nationalist or white supremacist,

26:24.560 --> 26:26.720
maybe before whining about the left,

26:26.720 --> 26:31.600
you should ask the various guests who come on your show to define those terms.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.560
Because if sympathizing with white nationalism,

26:34.560 --> 26:38.960
platforming racists, sharing white supremacist propaganda,

26:38.960 --> 26:40.560
questioning the Holocaust,

26:40.560 --> 26:46.240
and outright saying Hitler was good don't make you a racist or white supremacist,

26:47.200 --> 26:48.320
what does, man?

26:49.200 --> 26:50.800
A big swastika tattoo?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.480
That's, that's it, isn't it?

26:52.480 --> 26:55.360
It's just the big swastika tattoo.

26:55.360 --> 27:00.480
Now, I'm certain some Steven Crowder fans will protest my last two examples there,

27:00.480 --> 27:02.720
Gavin McInnes and Owen Benjamin,

27:02.720 --> 27:05.760
because they've quite recently been in trouble with Blaze TV,

27:05.760 --> 27:08.800
the network that hosts Steven Crowder's show.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.160
So if the network doesn't want to work with those people anymore,

27:12.160 --> 27:18.000
surely that's them being disciplined for their racist behavior and all is well, right?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.720
However, Steven Crowder was apparently worried

27:20.720 --> 27:25.680
about being made out to be some network stooge following Blaze TV orders.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.720
So he addressed both of these controversies publicly.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.000
Listen, this is Mug Club.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.440
We're funded by you, the viewer at Mug.

27:31.440 --> 27:35.120
So let me tell you, I had no idea about a lot of this stuff going on, okay?

27:35.760 --> 27:37.360
I've never worked for the Blaze.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.560
I don't work for the Blaze.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.560
This is something that is separate,

27:40.560 --> 27:43.520
where we actually allow you to get more value for your, for your buck,

27:44.320 --> 27:46.560
in agreement with CRTV, I guess now the Blaze,

27:46.560 --> 27:48.080
where you get more content.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.360
I didn't know about the Gavin McInnes situation until you did.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.400
And let me be really clear,

27:52.400 --> 27:57.200
Gavin McInnes has an open seat and invitation to work on a permanent basis here on this show,

27:57.200 --> 27:58.080
if he wants to.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.560
He knows, and by the way, also do his own show.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.560
And by the way, it has, I want to make sure this is really clear.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.880
Owen was never let go from this show.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.640
Owen could still write for this show, and I, I love him.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.160
Owen's a brilliant writer.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.240
So Steven Crowder is happy to keep working with these people, apparently.

28:14.240 --> 28:17.440
Gavin McInnes is still guesting on his show.

28:17.440 --> 28:20.320
So, you know, make of that what you will.

28:20.320 --> 28:24.160
I'd like now to talk about Steven's various comparative statements

28:24.160 --> 28:27.520
he makes throughout the video, so let's have a listen to a couple.

28:28.080 --> 28:32.400
"...is believing that the United States is believing that America is superior to Mexico.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.200
White supremacy.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.280
What if I were to say that white people, on average,

28:38.080 --> 28:41.760
have higher IQ scores than black people, on average?

28:42.560 --> 28:44.320
Is that white supremacy?"

28:44.320 --> 28:49.600
So then, did those statements what Steven Crowder said make him a racist?

28:49.600 --> 28:54.560
Well, I've actually explained my thoughts about such statements in a fairly old video of mine,

28:54.560 --> 28:56.640
but I'll give the short answer here.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.920
It depends on the context in which the statements were said.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.760
So let's take the statement,

29:01.760 --> 29:05.680
black people, on average, have lower IQ scores than white people.

29:05.680 --> 29:09.040
Now, I'm gonna say that again in two different contexts,

29:09.040 --> 29:10.960
and we'll see if we can spot the difference.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.560
So, okay.

29:12.560 --> 29:16.400
Black people, on average, have lower IQ scores than white people.

29:16.400 --> 29:21.200
However, lacking equal access to education and economic equality,

29:21.200 --> 29:24.880
this statement by itself can tell us nothing about any possible differences

29:24.960 --> 29:28.480
in cognitive ability inherent to black and white people.

29:28.480 --> 29:33.360
Without accounting for social influences, this statement is practically useless.

29:33.360 --> 29:37.040
I could also go into the problems with IQ as a measure of intelligence here,

29:37.040 --> 29:39.520
and especially the problems with the book The Bell Curve,

29:39.520 --> 29:42.960
which is the study mentioned in the screenshot that Crowder shows.

29:42.960 --> 29:46.560
However, I have a whole video dedicated to The Bell Curve in the works,

29:46.560 --> 29:50.560
and I don't want to spoil it here, so I'll just say it's rubbish.

29:50.560 --> 29:54.800
So okay, let's say that phrase again, but in the manner of a clueless racist.

29:54.800 --> 29:59.040
I want to create a white ethnostate and kick out all of the black people,

29:59.040 --> 30:02.960
because black people, on average, have lower IQ scores than white people.

30:02.960 --> 30:07.360
You see, I said the same words, Stephen, but in a different context.

30:07.360 --> 30:10.800
Whether or not they're racist depends on why you're saying them.

30:10.800 --> 30:15.760
So I suppose the pertinent question here is, in what context did you say them?

30:15.760 --> 30:18.880
Well, they're in a video, the goal of which is to create the impression

30:18.880 --> 30:23.120
that the terms white nationalist and white supremacist have lost all their meaning,

30:23.120 --> 30:27.360
hosted on the same channel that features you doing things like this.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.880
Of China.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.880
Miso Hori!

30:40.880 --> 30:47.040
So, yes, I deem this a pretty racist context in which to say those statements.

30:47.040 --> 30:50.000
Running defense for racists is racist.

30:50.640 --> 30:55.920
Platforming other racists on your show is racist, and I shouldn't have to say this one,

30:55.920 --> 31:00.240
but dressing up as offensive racial stereotypes is racist.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.160
Steven Crowder's a racist, basically.

31:04.160 --> 31:09.280
Now, to be fair, Crowder's show's primary purpose seems not to be any conscious attempt

31:09.280 --> 31:11.840
to spread racist beliefs for their own sake.

31:11.840 --> 31:17.120
The show is more of a hastily constructed anti-left stream of consciousness,

31:17.120 --> 31:21.360
made for what can be mockingly referred to as entertainment purposes.

31:21.360 --> 31:25.760
It turns out, though, that if you're in the anti-left pro-right entertainment game,

31:25.760 --> 31:28.880
there's just a lot of overlap with being a racist.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.800
And there's no difference functionally,

31:30.800 --> 31:34.160
so, you know, it doesn't really matter whether they're consciously doing it or not.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.480
To paraphrase a famous quote here,

31:36.480 --> 31:39.600
don't believe people when they tell you who they are.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.480
Believe people when they show you who they are.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.760
Steven Crowder can disavow racism a million times,

31:45.840 --> 31:50.720
and it won't mean anything if you keep sharing his platform with racists and white nationalists.

31:50.720 --> 31:56.240
All we can infer from that is that either he's a racist or a white nationalist or a white supremacist.

31:58.560 --> 32:00.640
Thanks a lot for watching, folks.

32:00.640 --> 32:03.920
There is one question left I haven't answered yet, however.

32:03.920 --> 32:08.880
Who should be banned by all those evil, lefty tech CEOs?

32:09.600 --> 32:14.720
Well, I happen to think that every white nationalist, white supremacist or racist,

32:14.720 --> 32:17.840
should be banned by every website they ever use.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.800
Now, how can I defend thinking that?

32:20.800 --> 32:23.760
Well, it's because I believe in freedom of speech.

32:23.760 --> 32:28.080
The idea that you can have a social media community in which everyone,

32:28.080 --> 32:33.680
racists and racial minorities, homophobes and gay people, transphobes and trans people,

32:33.680 --> 32:39.520
all freely discourse and speak their minds equally, is a doomed liberal fantasy.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.560
If you let the KKK recruit on your website,

32:42.640 --> 32:47.360
black people, understandably, aren't gonna trust you and they'll not want to use it.

32:47.360 --> 32:53.280
If you signal to your user base that harassing gay people doesn't violate your terms of service,

32:53.280 --> 32:57.760
gay people will not feel safe expressing themselves on your platform.

32:57.760 --> 33:02.320
This is a much worse affront to free speech than banning a few bigotses.

33:02.320 --> 33:07.440
We can't be tolerant of intolerance here, we have to pick a side, necessarily.

33:07.440 --> 33:12.800
Trying to keep everyone on board, which is the strategy favored by capitalist corporations,

33:12.800 --> 33:16.480
obviously, as that's the scenario with the theoretical largest return,

33:16.480 --> 33:18.720
even if it's unworkable in the long run,

33:18.720 --> 33:24.400
can only lead to that community eventually being overrun by intolerant bigots.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.280
So the solution is fairly simple, really.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.040
Just ban them all.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.560
And if they don't like it, fuck them.
