00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello, everyone. Now, before we get started with the video today,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,920
I'm gonna have to include a brief note about the concept of guilt by association.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,800
Now, let's say, for instance, I work in an office,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,320
and a colleague of mine is photographed kicking a cat.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,320
Say, now it would be unfair to also declare me guilty of that crime

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,720
simply for being associated in an unrelated way with the perpetrator.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,720
However, let's say an associate of mine is photographed kicking a cat,

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,360
only this time we're associated because he attends my cat kicking course,

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,560
where I teach the most effective ways to kick cats.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,520
That wouldn't merely be guilt by association, then,

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,800
because the way in which I was associated with him would have a direct link to his actions.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,480
That's just something I think it's important to make clear at the start here,

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,360
and you'll hopefully see why this was needed as we go on.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
Anyway, hello, everyone, again.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,760
This is a video about terms like white supremacist, white nationalist, and racist,

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,040
and it's also a response to a video posted by Steven Crowder

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,840
on the 30th of April this year entitled,

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,920
What Is White Supremacy?

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
In that video, Steven is worried about an apparent uncertainty

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,440
over who counts as a white nationalist or white supremacist or racist,

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,120
and he's furthermore worried that this confusion will lead to people being banned

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,400
from various social media sites merely by being accused of belonging to those groups.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,280
As always, I'd suggest you watch his video first,

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,480
so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his views.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,280
But we'll also briefly talk through Steven's argument here

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
before we get into responding to specific sections of it.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
So, okay, Steven opens his video with a flash-forward plea

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,160
to various social media tech CEOs asking them to define the terms

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,640
white supremacy and white nationalism,

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,720
and asks what should count as a bannable offense on social media.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,800
Steven then says he's against various recent white nationalist terror attacks.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,720
That's good.

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,080
But then starts complaining about people politicizing the murders,

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,640
quote, before the bodies are even cold.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,400
Which is always a silly thing to say,

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,000
because terror attacks are explicitly political by nature.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,760
You can't politicize them. They're already political.

38
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,480
Anyway.

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,080
Steven then complains about various news shows in the United States

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
calling President Trump a racist,

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,720
and then moves on to complain about journalists in the media

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520
apparently calling all manner of people who disagree with them

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,600
white supremacists or white nationalists,

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,640
including media figures like himself and Ben Shapiro.

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
He says that by the time we get to this, quote,

46
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,520
actual white supremacist, the term has lost all meaning.

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,080
Now, you might note here that corporate news journalists calling the president racist

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,280
have nothing at all to do with suspected white supremacists

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
being banned from social media websites.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
To the uninitiated, this leap of logic will seem rather confusing.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
But the actual reason for why Steven can do this

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,640
is that the point of his show is to argue against what he calls the left.

53
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,760
Which, for him, includes not just actual leftists, but also liberals.

54
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
Now, he's not able to distinguish between those two groups, obviously.

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,640
The Democratic Party establishments are also called the left,

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,840
despite being rather strongly disliked by the left.

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,080
And also, tech CEOs who run huge private corporations are also apparently the left.

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,240
It's a ridiculous us-versus-them oversimplification, basically.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,960
If you can convince your audience that all these disparate groups count as the left,

60
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,000
then manufacturing leftist hypocrisy is easy.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,720
The vast majority of the content on Steven's channel

62
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,400
is centered around criticizing these air quotes leftists,

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,560
even if the subject in question is a white nationalist mass murder.

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,880
Top five dumbest leftist reactions to synagogue shooting

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,240
is a real headline on their website, believe it or not.

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,320
Anyway, back to the video in question.

67
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,800
Steven then makes various comparative statements

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,440
about the abilities of various races of people,

69
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,160
and asks if saying those statements makes him a racist or a white supremacist.

70
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,800
He then says that leftists are calling everything a white supremacist dog whistle,

71
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,760
using clips of Donald Trump talking about choking

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
and being accused of referencing the murder of Eric Garner,

73
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
which happened five years ago.

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,360
Steven doesn't pick a more recent or relevant example

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,760
of a racist dog whistle for some reason.

76
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
You can't use this one anymore, I guess.

77
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
Steven then gives various comparative statements

78
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,040
about different countries and societies,

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,960
asking if saying those statements makes him a racist or a white supremacist.

80
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,840
Now, if you noticed that this was the exact same point as the IQ thing earlier in the video,

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,280
you're correct, it's not a very well-structured argument, this.

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,200
Then he waffles about how great western civilization is for a while

83
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,480
before closing out by saying that if social media platforms

84
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,120
are gonna ban people for being white supremacists,

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,760
then they have to define what white supremacy is.

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,200
The end.

87
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,360
Right, so what do we think about this video?

88
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
Why was it made?

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
Well, the description to the video says

90
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Steven Crowder thoroughly dissects media's use and misuse

91
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,000
of the terms white supremacy and white nationalism,

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,880
separating fact from liberal fiction.

93
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,080
But he doesn't thoroughly dissect anything, of course.

94
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,040
Once you strip out the regrettable celebrity impressions

95
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,720
and complaining about irrelevant criticisms of Donald Trump,

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,040
nearly all Steven says with regards to white nationalism and white supremacy is

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,280
I don't know what they mean.

98
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,760
Can somebody please help me?

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,560
I say nearly because to be charitable to Steven,

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,960
his one actual point appears to be

101
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,320
there is some uncertainty about who is and isn't a white nationalist,

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,400
white supremacist, racist, or whatever.

103
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,800
And that uncertainty is the fault of the leftist hive mind

104
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,000
for overusing those terms where they don't apply.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,520
So Steven wants someone on the left to tell him what those terms mean.

106
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,760
So that's what we're gonna do today.

107
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,880
We're gonna help Steven out and answer his questions.

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,560
So we'll start with the basic definitions of the terms he's confused about.

109
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,280
A white supremacist is someone who believes that white people

110
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,880
are superior to people of other races and should be in control of them.

111
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,320
A white nationalist is an advocate for enforced racial segregation

112
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,040
with the aim of creating an ethnically white state.

113
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,680
And a racist is someone who believes that a particular race

114
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,760
is inherently superior to others.

115
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,560
Now there's obviously a lot of crossover between those terms,

116
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,360
but at least in dictionary definition form here,

117
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,920
they aren't particularly confusing so far.

118
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,800
Now I'd like to go off on a little tangent here if you'll let me.

119
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,480
Well, you know, either way, you can't stop me.

120
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,240
So I'm not here to debate whether any of these terms

121
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
represent acceptable political positions.

122
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,840
They don't.

123
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,960
Here in the free marketplace of ideas,

124
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
I will debate absolutely any argument or position,

125
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,240
so long as it's debatable.

126
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,240
For instance, I won't debate whether two plus two equals five with you.

127
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,560
Not because I can't prove it doesn't,

128
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,240
but because there's no point.

129
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,760
It's a waste of time.

130
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,040
You know, take someone who thinks that two plus two equals five

131
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,400
and will argue the point.

132
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't want to convince them that they're wrong.

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
I don't want them on my side.

134
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,800
You know, if they looked at the evidence and came to that conclusion,

135
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,480
who knows what else they think?

136
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,440
They're embarrassing.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,560
Likewise with questions of equal rights.

138
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,960
Whether or not people deserve equal human rights

139
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
is a question with a right and a wrong answer

140
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
as clear cut as the previous example.

141
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,960
If you believe, for instance,

142
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,680
that white people are inherently superior to other races

143
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
and deserve to be treated preferentially by society as a result of that,

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,200
you are wrong.

145
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,880
There's nothing to be debated there.

146
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,080
Not because I can't explain why you're wrong,

147
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
but because as things stand,

148
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,280
you're incapable of understanding why you're wrong.

149
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,960
Anyway, tangent over.

150
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
Now, as we've seen,

151
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,040
Steven attributes the supposed ambiguity surrounding terms

152
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,520
like white supremacist, white nationalist, and so on

153
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,880
to leftist and or liberal overuse of the terms.

154
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,920
But I'd like to offer an alternative explanation,

155
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,800
something that Steven never considers in his video,

156
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,520
and it's this.

157
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Sometimes, people lie.

158
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,200
Now, that might sound shocking and unbelievable,

159
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
but stick with me.

160
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,840
Take this quote actual white supremacist

161
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,920
who Steven calls a white supremacist.

162
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,120
Now, is this really how obvious we need people to be

163
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,320
before we'll call them a white supremacist?

164
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,440
You know, you have to be at a white supremacist rally

165
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
proudly showing off a swastika tattoo,

166
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
because here's the thing.

167
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,560
There could be people out there

168
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,560
who have some or all of the same political opinions as this man,

169
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,040
but who are savvy enough to know it's a bad idea

170
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
to get a big swastika tattoo.

171
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,520
Let's pretend, for the purposes of argument,

172
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,200
that such people exist.

173
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,680
Actually, we don't need to pretend that.

174
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,160
Let's say you're Steven Crowder.

175
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,000
Apologies.

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,360
And you need a photograph of an actual white supremacist

177
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
for your internet video.

178
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
So what do you do?

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,800
You go to Google Images,

180
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,200
you type in actual white supremacist,

181
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,560
and there he is there.

182
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,160
Now, this photograph is of a man at the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally,

183
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
and it's from a website that says,

184
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,280
9% of Americans think it's okay to hold white supremacist or neo-Nazi views.

185
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,040
A Washington Post ABC News poll found that 9% of Americans

186
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,960
believe holding white supremacist or neo-Nazi views is acceptable.

187
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,520
A majority of Americans, regardless of party,

188
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,680
think it's unacceptable to hold such views.

189
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,520
83% overall.

190
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,240
So that's good.

191
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,240
Most confusing to me here, though, is if we click through to the poll,

192
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,520
the 8% of people who apparently have no opinion of neo-Nazi views at all.

193
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
What's going on with them?

194
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,080
Just sort of ambivalent, I guess, about the whole Nazism thing.

195
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,960
Now, even if we assume that this study was wildly off,

196
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,600
and 9% is a huge overestimation,

197
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,960
if even 1% of the US population thought that holding neo-Nazi views was acceptable,

198
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,760
that'd be more than 3 million people.

199
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,920
Trust me, they are out there.

200
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,120
You see, people who go to far-right rallies and wave swastika flags and do Hitler salutes,

201
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,760
we can call them open white supremacists, nationalists, racists, and whatever.

202
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,960
But what we also have to be concerned about are people who agree with this man,

203
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,600
who themselves are white supremacists and nationalists and racists and so on,

204
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,920
but who say that they aren't.

205
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
Now, there are some people in the right-wing media sphere

206
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,080
who are open white nationalists or supremacists,

207
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,480
but usually they don't get all that much of an audience

208
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
because those ideas phrased as clearly as that

209
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,920
mean you're very likely to eventually either get fired

210
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,320
or banned off whatever sites you're using.

211
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,760
Much more common than them are closeted white nationalists

212
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,960
who hide behind euphemisms for their actual beliefs.

213
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,480
They might say, you know,

214
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,520
I'm not a white nationalist, I'm an identitarian.

215
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm not a racist, I'm a race realist, and so on.

216
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,240
They'll say they disavow Nazism and white supremacy,

217
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,480
but they're saying that for branding reasons

218
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
rather than actual ideological disagreements.

219
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,840
They do support white nationalism,

220
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,280
but they understand that saying so would damage their cause.

221
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,000
So to advance white nationalism, they have to first pretend to disavow it.

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,840
And then separate from that group, there are some pure shameless grifters

223
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,520
with no real opinions of their own,

224
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,800
but who have worked out that there's a lot of money and attention to be had

225
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
in pandering to racists.

226
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,520
And now, what's the difference between all these groups of people

227
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,120
the, quote, real white nationalists, the closeted white nationalists, and the panderers?

228
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,560
Well, functionally, as far as I'm concerned, nothing.

229
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
They're all spreading the same propaganda.

230
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,840
It doesn't matter what they call it or their reason for doing it.

231
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,600
If you associate with and support racists and parrot their opinions,

232
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,440
you're a racist, regardless of if you say or even think you are.

233
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,080
Now, does thinking this mean I'll sometimes label someone

234
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
a white nationalist or racist or whatever

235
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,680
who claims not to be one?

236
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,800
Sure. Do I care about that?

237
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,640
Not really.

238
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,120
You know, in my opinion, the burden of proof is on them

239
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,440
to act less like a white nationalist.

240
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,080
And for any fans of Steven Crowder who might be watching

241
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,320
who think I'm being unfair here,

242
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
consider the following clip from another of his videos.

243
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,440
So they don't believe in the First Amendment,

244
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,240
whereas white nationalists, when we address the Constitution,

245
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,960
don't believe that all people were created equal.

246
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,680
If you look at the Declaration of Independence, that's right in there.

247
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,720
They don't believe that.

248
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,840
They all agree on one thing.

249
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,480
Equality is a dangerous myth.

250
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,800
The alt-right is united in rejecting the current dogma

251
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,960
that all races are equal.

252
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,360
And I know people say he's alt-right.

253
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,880
That's- he's a white nationalist.

254
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,520
So who is this guy who Steven called alt-right and a white nationalist?

255
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,280
Well, that's Jared Taylor,

256
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,040
editor of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance.

257
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,840
Jared Taylor is a white supremacist and white nationalist and racist.

258
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,200
And Steven Crowder was correct to identify him as such.

259
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,120
However, Taylor has been described as a white nationalist,

260
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,840
white supremacist, and racist by civil rights groups,

261
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,120
news media, academics studying racism in the US, and others.

262
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,280
Many sources.

263
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,720
Taylor has strenuously rejected being called a racist

264
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,920
and maintains that he is instead a racialist who believes in race realism.

265
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,720
That's a good one.

266
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,920
He's also said that he's not a white supremacist,

267
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,560
describing himself as a white advocate,

268
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
and contends that his views on nationality and race are moderate,

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,400
commonsensical, and fully consistent with the views of most of the great statesmen

270
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,320
and presidents of America's past.

271
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,760
Yeah, mainly the ones who own slaves, I think you'll find.

272
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,960
Well, what's my point here?

273
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,200
Well, Steven Crowder clearly has no objection to calling a racist a racist

274
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
when he believes the term to be accurate,

275
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,840
even if they themselves would prefer the term racialist or whatever else.

276
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,200
He feels entitled to make that judgment call there,

277
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,520
and that's the same judgment call he's criticizing those on the left for making.

278
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Now, given that Steven, in his video,

279
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,240
complains about people calling him a white supremacist or nationalist or whatever,

280
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,440
let's take a look at some possible reasons that might be.

281
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,160
And we'll stick with Jared Taylor here for a second.

282
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,960
So, we have on the line, and I guess for those of you video-based,

283
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,720
on the screen, Jared Taylor.

284
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,520
Now, Jared Taylor is the editor of American Renaissance,

285
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,440
the president of the New Century Foundation,

286
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,720
and the author of many books on race relations.

287
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,400
We're going to put links to those below.

288
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,440
I highly recommend them.

289
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,800
It's very data-driven, not ideological, very fact-based, and very eye-opening.

290
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,360
It's sort of chilling when you realize the degree to which essential information

291
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
for the improvement of race relations is kept hidden from people.

292
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,080
And the New Century Foundation recently released an updated version of,

293
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,520
I guess you could call it a pamphlet,

294
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,480
but a very data-driven presentation on the color of crime.

295
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,720
It's a report on differences in crime rates by race,

296
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,720
an examination of questions of bias in the justice system,

297
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,440
and, of course, interracial crime statistics.

298
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,960
So, that clip was of Jared Taylor being featured on Stefan Molyneux's YouTube channel,

299
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,520
with Stefan sharing Taylor's work with his audience

300
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,480
and linking in the description to his various websites.

301
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,880
Now, Stefan Molyneux is a white nationalist,

302
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,600
or at least a white nationalist sympathizer,

303
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,160
coming out as such in a documentary about a trip to Poland he made late last year.

304
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,360
First of all, I've always been skeptical of the ideas

305
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,680
of white nationalism, of identitarianism, and white identity.

306
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,120
However, I am an empiricist, and I could not help but notice

307
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,400
that I could have peaceful, free, easy, civilized, and safe discussions

308
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,280
in what is essentially an all-white country.

309
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,440
I've spoken out against white nationalism, but I'm an empiricist.

310
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm listening.

311
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm listening to my experiences, can't argue with the facts.

312
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,000
So, that's pretty blatant there.

313
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,840
He does do the whole, of course,

314
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,800
I've always been very skeptical of white nationalism routine,

315
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,680
so we can back away from it later if he's called out.

316
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,840
It's a wordier version of, I'm not a racist, but, you know.

317
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,920
He also calls himself an empiricist,

318
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,800
and then offers only anecdotal evidence for now thinking

319
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
that white nationalism is good, which is pretty funny.

320
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,680
So, why am I talking about Stefan Molyneux?

321
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,840
Well, if we can't always trust what people say when they tell us who they are,

322
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,480
how can we tell who is a white nationalist, or racist, or whatever else?

323
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,160
Well, we can ask ourselves, what sorts of things would we see a secret racist do?

324
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,040
Well, how about platform other racists,

325
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,200
and sell their work to your audience to financially support them?

326
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,080
And following on from that, Stefan Molyneux has been a guest

327
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,240
on Steven Crowder's show multiple times,

328
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,120
and here's a clip of Molyneux advertising a book he wrote

329
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
on Steven Crowder's YouTube channel.

330
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,680
So, a note for YouTubers here.

331
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,920
Even if you totally disagree with someone,

332
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,920
and were planning to completely destroy them in debate with facts and logic,

333
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,480
you don't need to do this.

334
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,080
You know, have them on the show and let them advertise their merch.

335
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,120
You can debate Stefan Molyneux's opinions without once involving him.

336
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,240
This is never necessary, unless your goal is to support him financially.

337
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,360
So anyway, Steven calls Taylor a white nationalist,

338
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,880
but supports Stefan Molyneux financially and shares his work,

339
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,240
who then supports Taylor financially and shares his work.

340
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,880
The link from Steven Crowder to someone Steven Crowder considers a white nationalist

341
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,080
consists of one other white nationalist there.

342
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,560
Let's not draw any premature conclusions here, though.

343
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,160
Let's be a little more thorough.

344
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,200
So, okay.

345
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,560
The next behavior we might see a secret racist engage in

346
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,320
is downplaying the danger of white supremacy and white nationalism.

347
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,520
You know, you could say, I disavow it, of course,

348
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,760
but it's not really that big of a deal, is it?

349
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,800
What do you make of the whole white supremacy thing?

350
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,760
The idea that we even have to talk about this seems sort of ridiculous.

351
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,000
I just don't think, yes, I think there are some white supremacists,

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,680
as there always have been.

353
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
I don't think that there are Nazis running around.

354
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,960
Nazis were a political party in Germany in the 1930s.

355
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
They're not really running around now.

356
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,920
Yeah, and like half the people on sites like Stormfront are feds.

357
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
Like, it's a big joke online.

358
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,400
If you go, I spend a lot of time like in tons of different political communities,

359
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,760
on Facebook, just like reading it.

360
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,400
And if you go into any alt-right Facebook groups,

361
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,760
the joke is always if you post anything super Nazi or anything,

362
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,680
they're like, oh, fed, are you a fed, right?

363
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,080
They're like, no one does that in real life.

364
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,240
No one runs around with Nazi tattoos in real life.

365
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,040
You don't see it.

366
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,320
That's Dave Rubin and Lauren Southern there,

367
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,960
asking where on earth all the Nazis are

368
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,720
just a few months prior to the Unite the Right rally at Charlottesville.

369
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,320
You don't see people with swastika tattoos running around anymore.

370
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,720
Oh, no, there they are, there.

371
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
And they killed someone.

372
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,800
We don't know what we're talking about, clearly.

373
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,560
We were fatally incorrect.

374
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,160
We apologize and quit because we're obviously incompetent.

375
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,640
Now, that's my own fantasy.

376
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,280
There, I should make clear they didn't actually say that.

377
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,920
So how does this relate to Steven Crowder's video?

378
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,960
Well, firstly, his own website goes in pretty hard

379
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
on the Unite the Right attendees and organizers.

380
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,560
It here calls them the Charlottesville supremacists.

381
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,200
It calls Richard Spencer an asshole and an unapologetic white supremacist

382
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,320
and refers to his smug little Nazi face.

383
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
That article was shared by Steven Crowder on Twitter,

384
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,040
so we can assume he agrees with those statements.

385
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,520
So, okay, Steven Crowder has identified a Unite the Right attendee

386
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
as an actual white supremacist

387
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,440
and ran an article that called the organizer of the event a smug Nazi.

388
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,280
All good so far.

389
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,920
Returning to Lauren Southern, however, she would appear to disagree.

390
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,960
Well, you would agree that some of it exists, right?

391
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
Like, there's something there somewhere, that's right.

392
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,280
Yeah, even the Richard Spencers of the world,

393
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,440
like, even them, they're kind of misrepresented as well.

394
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,560
Like, Richard Spencer is not a white supremacist.

395
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,760
He is a white nationalist.

396
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
He believes in a white ethnostate.

397
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,920
He doesn't believe in whites being superior.

398
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,000
So Richard Spencer is not a white supremacist, apparently.

399
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,640
He's a white nationalist, according to Lauren Southern.

400
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,400
However...

401
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
And I don't identify as a white nationalist,

402
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,280
just to, you know, let that be known.

403
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,760
History is often a zero-sum game.

404
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,360
History is often about subordination and domination.

405
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,160
And it's about patronage and so on.

406
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,000
And if we want to try to get away from that

407
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,920
in order to be ideologically pure,

408
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,640
like, oh, every ethnicity will have its little state,

409
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,080
we're not going to really go anywhere.

410
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,840
So why would Lauren Southern lie about Richard Spencer's views?

411
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,360
Well, because she's trying to downplay the seriousness and danger of white supremacy,

412
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,000
because that furthers her political goals.

413
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,120
If more people believe there are no more white supremacists,

414
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,040
that's fewer people who could recognize her as a white supremacist.

415
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,480
You see, Lauren Southern pals around with various, air-quote,

416
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,320
identitarian groups,

417
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,800
most famously to interfere with migrant rescue operations in the Mediterranean.

418
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,480
She shared false information about the Quebec City mosque shooting on Twitter,

419
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,440
incorrectly identifying the shooters as Syrian refugees

420
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,920
when it was actually a far-right white nationalist.

421
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,880
She made a video popularizing the white supremacist Great Replacement conspiracy theory,

422
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,720
the same conspiracy theory that inspired the Christchurch mosque shootings

423
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,040
that killed more than 50 people in New Zealand.

424
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,120
The shooter titled his manifesto The Great Replacement, even.

425
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,160
And Lauren Southern is a frequent guest on Steven Crowder's show.

426
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,720
So again, we have someone who all but calls themselves a white nationalist,

427
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,240
who downplays the existence of Nazis and white supremacists

428
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,960
while sharing their conspiracy theories,

429
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,360
being supported by Steven Crowder.

430
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,800
But again, let's not jump the gun here, we'll keep going.

431
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,400
So this is Milo Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart contributor

432
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
who was fired from everything after he said child abuse was okay.

433
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,600
Here he is serenading a bunch of neo-Nazis in a bar,

434
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,400
including Richard Spencer throwing a Hitler salute.

435
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,440
Now in 2017, a bunch of Breitbart emails were leaked,

436
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,840
which included, among other things, a leak of Milo's password for his email account,

437
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,720
which was Long Knives 1290.

438
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,360
Now that's a reference to both the Night of the Long Knives,

439
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,160
which was a Nazi purge carried out by Adolf Hitler,

440
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,880
and the 1290 Edict of Expulsion,

441
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,160
a royal decree issued by King Edward I of England,

442
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,800
expelling all the Jews from his kingdom.

443
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,560
Well, you know the punchline by now.

444
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,640
Milo Yiannopoulos has appeared several times on Steven Crowder's show.

445
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,040
Moving on, this chap is Gavin McInnes,

446
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,760
founder of the far-right gang The Proud Boys.

447
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
And this is an easy one.

448
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,800
Here's a clip of Gavin McInnes calling himself anti-Semitic

449
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,200
and sympathizing with Holocaust deniers.

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,160
This is basically a brainwashing trip.

451
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,440
I mean, I think the Israeli government paid for this,

452
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
and we had donors too, but I think they were mostly Israelis

453
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,880
that assume that we're going to listen to all this shit, we get fed.

454
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,120
And that is having the reverse effect on me.

455
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm becoming anti-Semitic, like at the Holocaust Museum,

456
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,160
or as I call it, the Holocaust Museum.

457
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,880
No, I'm just kidding.

458
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
Yeah, like at one point the tour guide goes,

459
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,040
you know, and there are people who think that this didn't happen.

460
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,520
And I felt myself defending the super far-right Nazis,

461
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,080
just because I was sick of being so much brainwashing,

462
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,080
and I felt like going, well, they never said it didn't happen.

463
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,040
What they're saying is that it was much less than six million,

464
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,880
and that they starved to death and they weren't gassed,

465
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,040
that they didn't have supplies.

466
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,440
Notice how Gavin downplays the actual beliefs of Holocaust deniers there,

467
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,440
because of course there are people who think the entire Holocaust was a hoax,

468
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,080
including Andrew Anglin from the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer,

469
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
who wrote about this clip saying,

470
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,920
I completely 100% endorse these statements.

471
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,200
Obviously I disagree with the Holocaust happened part,

472
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,600
but we can't really expect him not to say that

473
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,400
while he's literally still in Israel filming this.

474
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,720
Everything else is totally and completely on point and awesome,

475
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,280
which is not a sentence you want The Daily Stormer

476
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,000
to ever say about any of your opinions.

477
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,080
Gavin McInnes also wrote about Richard Spencer back in 2016 saying,

478
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,560
I've known alt-right pioneer Richard Spencer since he got me the job at this magazine,

479
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,000
and even he, the head of the snake, comes across as perfectly reasonable in conversation.

480
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,680
He doesn't think non-whites can be included in a harmonious America,

481
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:30,980
but...

482
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,080
everything else on his plate is relatively civil.

483
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,680
Gavin McInnes has also provided a platform to Jared Taylor.

484
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,640
The main researcher on this is Edward Rubenstein.

485
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,760
He's a very well-known economist and researcher.

486
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,240
He did a really fantastic, thorough job.

487
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,740
So...

488
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,040
Sounds like, uh, hee-hee!

489
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
What's this?

490
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,760
That's my, uh, Jew, uh, finger thing.

491
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,120
And of course, Gavin McInnes is a frequent contributor to Steven Crowder's show.

492
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,520
All right, next up we have Owen Benjamin, who is a comedian, apparently.

493
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,960
Now, Owen has been on Steven Crowder's show multiple times,

494
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,440
even filling in as host of the show when Steven Crowder wasn't available.

495
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,880
So you'd imagine he's a pretty trusted person around those parts

496
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
if they let him in the driver's seat, right?

497
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,720
Now, Owen Benjamin also does his own internet web streams on YouTube,

498
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,520
and let's take a peek at one of those.

499
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,040
But it wasn't gas chambers.

500
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,760
It wasn't extermination based on race.

501
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,440
What if it literally was work will set you free work, motherfucker,

502
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,720
and they died?

503
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,400
That's infinitely more probable.

504
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
If you're a dictator, right?

505
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,120
Why would you kill your slaves?

506
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,680
Well, I have another artist that I'm a big fan of.

507
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,180
Hitler.

508
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,840
He was a great artist.

509
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
He was also a great writer.

510
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
Mein Kampf and all his paintings.

511
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
Really, what he was trying to do is clean Germany.

512
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,560
Clean it of the parasites, of the fleas.

513
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,480
He was not, he did not hate Jews.

514
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,440
He hated filth.

515
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,880
And he was trying to clean up.

516
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,920
And I'm not sure there's much I need to say about that.

517
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,640
So, to Steven Crowder, I'll say this.

518
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,680
If you want people to not call you a racist,

519
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,520
maybe stop inviting racists onto your YouTube show that you do.

520
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,560
And if you're confused about who is and is not a white nationalist or white supremacist,

521
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,720
maybe before whining about the left,

522
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,600
you should ask the various guests who come on your show to define those terms.

523
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,560
Because if sympathizing with white nationalism,

524
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,960
platforming racists, sharing white supremacist propaganda,

525
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,560
questioning the Holocaust,

526
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,240
and outright saying Hitler was good don't make you a racist or white supremacist,

527
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,320
what does, man?

528
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,800
A big swastika tattoo?

529
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,480
That's, that's it, isn't it?

530
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,360
It's just the big swastika tattoo.

531
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,480
Now, I'm certain some Steven Crowder fans will protest my last two examples there,

532
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,720
Gavin McInnes and Owen Benjamin,

533
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,760
because they've quite recently been in trouble with Blaze TV,

534
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,800
the network that hosts Steven Crowder's show.

535
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,160
So if the network doesn't want to work with those people anymore,

536
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,000
surely that's them being disciplined for their racist behavior and all is well, right?

537
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,720
However, Steven Crowder was apparently worried

538
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,680
about being made out to be some network stooge following Blaze TV orders.

539
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,720
So he addressed both of these controversies publicly.

540
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,000
Listen, this is Mug Club.

541
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,440
We're funded by you, the viewer at Mug.

542
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,120
So let me tell you, I had no idea about a lot of this stuff going on, okay?

543
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
I've never worked for the Blaze.

544
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,560
I don't work for the Blaze.

545
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,560
This is something that is separate,

546
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,520
where we actually allow you to get more value for your, for your buck,

547
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,560
in agreement with CRTV, I guess now the Blaze,

548
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,080
where you get more content.

549
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,360
I didn't know about the Gavin McInnes situation until you did.

550
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,400
And let me be really clear,

551
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,200
Gavin McInnes has an open seat and invitation to work on a permanent basis here on this show,

552
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,080
if he wants to.

553
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,560
He knows, and by the way, also do his own show.

554
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
And by the way, it has, I want to make sure this is really clear.

555
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,880
Owen was never let go from this show.

556
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,640
Owen could still write for this show, and I, I love him.

557
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,160
Owen's a brilliant writer.

558
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,240
So Steven Crowder is happy to keep working with these people, apparently.

559
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,440
Gavin McInnes is still guesting on his show.

560
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,320
So, you know, make of that what you will.

561
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,160
I'd like now to talk about Steven's various comparative statements

562
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,520
he makes throughout the video, so let's have a listen to a couple.

563
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,400
"...is believing that the United States is believing that America is superior to Mexico.

564
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,200
White supremacy.

565
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,280
What if I were to say that white people, on average,

566
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,760
have higher IQ scores than black people, on average?

567
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,320
Is that white supremacy?"

568
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,600
So then, did those statements what Steven Crowder said make him a racist?

569
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,560
Well, I've actually explained my thoughts about such statements in a fairly old video of mine,

570
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,640
but I'll give the short answer here.

571
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,920
It depends on the context in which the statements were said.

572
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,760
So let's take the statement,

573
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,680
black people, on average, have lower IQ scores than white people.

574
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,040
Now, I'm gonna say that again in two different contexts,

575
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,960
and we'll see if we can spot the difference.

576
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,560
So, okay.

577
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,400
Black people, on average, have lower IQ scores than white people.

578
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,200
However, lacking equal access to education and economic equality,

579
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,880
this statement by itself can tell us nothing about any possible differences

580
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,480
in cognitive ability inherent to black and white people.

581
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,360
Without accounting for social influences, this statement is practically useless.

582
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,040
I could also go into the problems with IQ as a measure of intelligence here,

583
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,520
and especially the problems with the book The Bell Curve,

584
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,960
which is the study mentioned in the screenshot that Crowder shows.

585
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,560
However, I have a whole video dedicated to The Bell Curve in the works,

586
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,560
and I don't want to spoil it here, so I'll just say it's rubbish.

587
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,800
So okay, let's say that phrase again, but in the manner of a clueless racist.

588
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,040
I want to create a white ethnostate and kick out all of the black people,

589
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,960
because black people, on average, have lower IQ scores than white people.

590
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,360
You see, I said the same words, Stephen, but in a different context.

591
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,800
Whether or not they're racist depends on why you're saying them.

592
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,760
So I suppose the pertinent question here is, in what context did you say them?

593
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,880
Well, they're in a video, the goal of which is to create the impression

594
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,120
that the terms white nationalist and white supremacist have lost all their meaning,

595
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,360
hosted on the same channel that features you doing things like this.

596
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,880
Of China.

597
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
Miso Hori!

598
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,040
So, yes, I deem this a pretty racist context in which to say those statements.

599
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,000
Running defense for racists is racist.

600
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,920
Platforming other racists on your show is racist, and I shouldn't have to say this one,

601
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,240
but dressing up as offensive racial stereotypes is racist.

602
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,160
Steven Crowder's a racist, basically.

603
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,280
Now, to be fair, Crowder's show's primary purpose seems not to be any conscious attempt

604
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,840
to spread racist beliefs for their own sake.

605
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,120
The show is more of a hastily constructed anti-left stream of consciousness,

606
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,360
made for what can be mockingly referred to as entertainment purposes.

607
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,760
It turns out, though, that if you're in the anti-left pro-right entertainment game,

608
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,880
there's just a lot of overlap with being a racist.

609
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,800
And there's no difference functionally,

610
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,160
so, you know, it doesn't really matter whether they're consciously doing it or not.

611
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,480
To paraphrase a famous quote here,

612
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,600
don't believe people when they tell you who they are.

613
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,480
Believe people when they show you who they are.

614
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,760
Steven Crowder can disavow racism a million times,

615
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,720
and it won't mean anything if you keep sharing his platform with racists and white nationalists.

616
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,240
All we can infer from that is that either he's a racist or a white nationalist or a white supremacist.

617
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,640
Thanks a lot for watching, folks.

618
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,920
There is one question left I haven't answered yet, however.

619
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,880
Who should be banned by all those evil, lefty tech CEOs?

620
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,720
Well, I happen to think that every white nationalist, white supremacist or racist,

621
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,840
should be banned by every website they ever use.

622
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,800
Now, how can I defend thinking that?

623
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,760
Well, it's because I believe in freedom of speech.

624
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,080
The idea that you can have a social media community in which everyone,

625
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,680
racists and racial minorities, homophobes and gay people, transphobes and trans people,

626
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,520
all freely discourse and speak their minds equally, is a doomed liberal fantasy.

627
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,560
If you let the KKK recruit on your website,

628
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,360
black people, understandably, aren't gonna trust you and they'll not want to use it.

629
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,280
If you signal to your user base that harassing gay people doesn't violate your terms of service,

630
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,760
gay people will not feel safe expressing themselves on your platform.

631
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,320
This is a much worse affront to free speech than banning a few bigotses.

632
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,440
We can't be tolerant of intolerance here, we have to pick a side, necessarily.

633
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,800
Trying to keep everyone on board, which is the strategy favored by capitalist corporations,

634
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,480
obviously, as that's the scenario with the theoretical largest return,

635
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,720
even if it's unworkable in the long run,

636
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,400
can only lead to that community eventually being overrun by intolerant bigots.

637
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,280
So the solution is fairly simple, really.

638
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,040
Just ban them all.

639
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,560
And if they don't like it, fuck them.
