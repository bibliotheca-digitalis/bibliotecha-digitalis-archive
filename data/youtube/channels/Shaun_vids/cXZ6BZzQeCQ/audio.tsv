0	3440	Hello, everyone. Now, before we get started with the video today,
3440	7920	I'm gonna have to include a brief note about the concept of guilt by association.
7920	10800	Now, let's say, for instance, I work in an office,
10800	14320	and a colleague of mine is photographed kicking a cat.
14320	18320	Say, now it would be unfair to also declare me guilty of that crime
18320	22720	simply for being associated in an unrelated way with the perpetrator.
22720	26720	However, let's say an associate of mine is photographed kicking a cat,
26800	31360	only this time we're associated because he attends my cat kicking course,
31360	34560	where I teach the most effective ways to kick cats.
34560	37520	That wouldn't merely be guilt by association, then,
37520	42800	because the way in which I was associated with him would have a direct link to his actions.
42800	46480	That's just something I think it's important to make clear at the start here,
46480	49360	and you'll hopefully see why this was needed as we go on.
50000	52640	Anyway, hello, everyone, again.
52640	57760	This is a video about terms like white supremacist, white nationalist, and racist,
57760	61040	and it's also a response to a video posted by Steven Crowder
61040	63840	on the 30th of April this year entitled,
63840	65920	What Is White Supremacy?
65920	69360	In that video, Steven is worried about an apparent uncertainty
69360	73440	over who counts as a white nationalist or white supremacist or racist,
73440	77120	and he's furthermore worried that this confusion will lead to people being banned
77120	82400	from various social media sites merely by being accused of belonging to those groups.
82400	85280	As always, I'd suggest you watch his video first,
85280	88480	so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his views.
88480	91280	But we'll also briefly talk through Steven's argument here
91280	94320	before we get into responding to specific sections of it.
94320	97920	So, okay, Steven opens his video with a flash-forward plea
97920	102160	to various social media tech CEOs asking them to define the terms
102160	104640	white supremacy and white nationalism,
104640	108720	and asks what should count as a bannable offense on social media.
108720	112800	Steven then says he's against various recent white nationalist terror attacks.
113600	114720	That's good.
114720	118080	But then starts complaining about people politicizing the murders,
118080	120640	quote, before the bodies are even cold.
120640	122400	Which is always a silly thing to say,
122400	126000	because terror attacks are explicitly political by nature.
126000	129760	You can't politicize them. They're already political.
129760	130480	Anyway.
130480	134080	Steven then complains about various news shows in the United States
134080	135920	calling President Trump a racist,
135920	138720	and then moves on to complain about journalists in the media
138720	141520	apparently calling all manner of people who disagree with them
141520	143600	white supremacists or white nationalists,
143600	146640	including media figures like himself and Ben Shapiro.
146640	149120	He says that by the time we get to this, quote,
149120	153520	actual white supremacist, the term has lost all meaning.
153520	158080	Now, you might note here that corporate news journalists calling the president racist
158080	161280	have nothing at all to do with suspected white supremacists
161280	163840	being banned from social media websites.
163840	168000	To the uninitiated, this leap of logic will seem rather confusing.
168000	170480	But the actual reason for why Steven can do this
170480	174640	is that the point of his show is to argue against what he calls the left.
174640	179760	Which, for him, includes not just actual leftists, but also liberals.
179760	183280	Now, he's not able to distinguish between those two groups, obviously.
183280	186640	The Democratic Party establishments are also called the left,
186640	189840	despite being rather strongly disliked by the left.
189840	196080	And also, tech CEOs who run huge private corporations are also apparently the left.
196080	200240	It's a ridiculous us-versus-them oversimplification, basically.
200240	204960	If you can convince your audience that all these disparate groups count as the left,
204960	208000	then manufacturing leftist hypocrisy is easy.
208000	210720	The vast majority of the content on Steven's channel
210720	214400	is centered around criticizing these air quotes leftists,
214400	218560	even if the subject in question is a white nationalist mass murder.
218560	222880	Top five dumbest leftist reactions to synagogue shooting
222880	226240	is a real headline on their website, believe it or not.
226240	228320	Anyway, back to the video in question.
228320	230800	Steven then makes various comparative statements
230800	233440	about the abilities of various races of people,
233440	238160	and asks if saying those statements makes him a racist or a white supremacist.
238160	242800	He then says that leftists are calling everything a white supremacist dog whistle,
242800	245760	using clips of Donald Trump talking about choking
245760	248640	and being accused of referencing the murder of Eric Garner,
248640	250640	which happened five years ago.
250640	253360	Steven doesn't pick a more recent or relevant example
253360	255760	of a racist dog whistle for some reason.
255760	258160	You can't use this one anymore, I guess.
258160	260560	Steven then gives various comparative statements
260560	263040	about different countries and societies,
263040	266960	asking if saying those statements makes him a racist or a white supremacist.
267520	271840	Now, if you noticed that this was the exact same point as the IQ thing earlier in the video,
272400	275280	you're correct, it's not a very well-structured argument, this.
275360	279200	Then he waffles about how great western civilization is for a while
279200	282480	before closing out by saying that if social media platforms
282480	285120	are gonna ban people for being white supremacists,
285120	287760	then they have to define what white supremacy is.
288480	289200	The end.
289200	291360	Right, so what do we think about this video?
291360	292560	Why was it made?
292560	294880	Well, the description to the video says
294880	298880	Steven Crowder thoroughly dissects media's use and misuse
298880	302000	of the terms white supremacy and white nationalism,
302000	304880	separating fact from liberal fiction.
305040	308080	But he doesn't thoroughly dissect anything, of course.
308080	311040	Once you strip out the regrettable celebrity impressions
311040	314720	and complaining about irrelevant criticisms of Donald Trump,
314720	319040	nearly all Steven says with regards to white nationalism and white supremacy is
319040	321280	I don't know what they mean.
321280	323760	Can somebody please help me?
323760	326560	I say nearly because to be charitable to Steven,
326560	328960	his one actual point appears to be
328960	332320	there is some uncertainty about who is and isn't a white nationalist,
332320	334400	white supremacist, racist, or whatever.
334960	338800	And that uncertainty is the fault of the leftist hive mind
338800	342000	for overusing those terms where they don't apply.
342000	345520	So Steven wants someone on the left to tell him what those terms mean.
346400	347760	So that's what we're gonna do today.
347760	350880	We're gonna help Steven out and answer his questions.
350880	354560	So we'll start with the basic definitions of the terms he's confused about.
354560	357280	A white supremacist is someone who believes that white people
357280	360880	are superior to people of other races and should be in control of them.
360880	364320	A white nationalist is an advocate for enforced racial segregation
364320	367040	with the aim of creating an ethnically white state.
367040	369680	And a racist is someone who believes that a particular race
369680	371760	is inherently superior to others.
371760	374560	Now there's obviously a lot of crossover between those terms,
374560	377360	but at least in dictionary definition form here,
377360	379920	they aren't particularly confusing so far.
379920	382800	Now I'd like to go off on a little tangent here if you'll let me.
383840	386480	Well, you know, either way, you can't stop me.
387200	390240	So I'm not here to debate whether any of these terms
390240	392720	represent acceptable political positions.
393280	393840	They don't.
394480	396960	Here in the free marketplace of ideas,
396960	399840	I will debate absolutely any argument or position,
400400	402240	so long as it's debatable.
402240	406240	For instance, I won't debate whether two plus two equals five with you.
406240	408560	Not because I can't prove it doesn't,
408560	410240	but because there's no point.
410240	411760	It's a waste of time.
411760	415040	You know, take someone who thinks that two plus two equals five
415040	416400	and will argue the point.
417120	420000	I don't want to convince them that they're wrong.
420000	421680	I don't want them on my side.
421680	424800	You know, if they looked at the evidence and came to that conclusion,
424800	426480	who knows what else they think?
426480	427440	They're embarrassing.
428000	430560	Likewise with questions of equal rights.
430560	432960	Whether or not people deserve equal human rights
432960	435120	is a question with a right and a wrong answer
435120	437520	as clear cut as the previous example.
437520	438960	If you believe, for instance,
438960	441680	that white people are inherently superior to other races
441680	445360	and deserve to be treated preferentially by society as a result of that,
446000	447200	you are wrong.
447200	448880	There's nothing to be debated there.
449360	452080	Not because I can't explain why you're wrong,
452080	454080	but because as things stand,
454080	457280	you're incapable of understanding why you're wrong.
457280	458960	Anyway, tangent over.
458960	459920	Now, as we've seen,
459920	463040	Steven attributes the supposed ambiguity surrounding terms
463040	465520	like white supremacist, white nationalist, and so on
465520	468880	to leftist and or liberal overuse of the terms.
468880	471920	But I'd like to offer an alternative explanation,
471920	474800	something that Steven never considers in his video,
474800	475520	and it's this.
476240	478240	Sometimes, people lie.
478960	481200	Now, that might sound shocking and unbelievable,
481200	482400	but stick with me.
483040	485840	Take this quote actual white supremacist
485840	487920	who Steven calls a white supremacist.
487920	491120	Now, is this really how obvious we need people to be
491680	494320	before we'll call them a white supremacist?
494320	497440	You know, you have to be at a white supremacist rally
497440	499680	proudly showing off a swastika tattoo,
499680	501200	because here's the thing.
501200	502560	There could be people out there
502560	506560	who have some or all of the same political opinions as this man,
506560	509040	but who are savvy enough to know it's a bad idea
509040	511040	to get a big swastika tattoo.
511040	513520	Let's pretend, for the purposes of argument,
513520	515200	that such people exist.
515200	517680	Actually, we don't need to pretend that.
518400	520160	Let's say you're Steven Crowder.
520960	522000	Apologies.
522000	525360	And you need a photograph of an actual white supremacist
525360	526640	for your internet video.
526640	527600	So what do you do?
527600	528800	You go to Google Images,
528800	531200	you type in actual white supremacist,
531200	532560	and there he is there.
532560	536160	Now, this photograph is of a man at the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally,
536160	538080	and it's from a website that says,
538080	543280	9% of Americans think it's okay to hold white supremacist or neo-Nazi views.
543280	547040	A Washington Post ABC News poll found that 9% of Americans
547040	550960	believe holding white supremacist or neo-Nazi views is acceptable.
550960	553520	A majority of Americans, regardless of party,
553520	555680	think it's unacceptable to hold such views.
555680	557520	83% overall.
557520	558240	So that's good.
558960	562240	Most confusing to me here, though, is if we click through to the poll,
562320	567520	the 8% of people who apparently have no opinion of neo-Nazi views at all.
568240	569760	What's going on with them?
569760	574080	Just sort of ambivalent, I guess, about the whole Nazism thing.
574080	576960	Now, even if we assume that this study was wildly off,
576960	579600	and 9% is a huge overestimation,
579600	584960	if even 1% of the US population thought that holding neo-Nazi views was acceptable,
584960	587760	that'd be more than 3 million people.
587760	589920	Trust me, they are out there.
590480	595120	You see, people who go to far-right rallies and wave swastika flags and do Hitler salutes,
595120	599760	we can call them open white supremacists, nationalists, racists, and whatever.
600400	604960	But what we also have to be concerned about are people who agree with this man,
604960	609600	who themselves are white supremacists and nationalists and racists and so on,
609600	611920	but who say that they aren't.
611920	614720	Now, there are some people in the right-wing media sphere
614720	618080	who are open white nationalists or supremacists,
618080	620480	but usually they don't get all that much of an audience
620480	623200	because those ideas phrased as clearly as that
623200	625920	mean you're very likely to eventually either get fired
625920	628320	or banned off whatever sites you're using.
628320	631760	Much more common than them are closeted white nationalists
631760	634960	who hide behind euphemisms for their actual beliefs.
634960	636480	They might say, you know,
636480	639520	I'm not a white nationalist, I'm an identitarian.
639520	642880	I'm not a racist, I'm a race realist, and so on.
642880	646240	They'll say they disavow Nazism and white supremacy,
646240	648480	but they're saying that for branding reasons
648480	651600	rather than actual ideological disagreements.
651600	653840	They do support white nationalism,
653840	657280	but they understand that saying so would damage their cause.
657280	662000	So to advance white nationalism, they have to first pretend to disavow it.
662000	665840	And then separate from that group, there are some pure shameless grifters
665840	667520	with no real opinions of their own,
667520	670800	but who have worked out that there's a lot of money and attention to be had
670800	672800	in pandering to racists.
672800	675520	And now, what's the difference between all these groups of people
675600	681120	the, quote, real white nationalists, the closeted white nationalists, and the panderers?
681120	684560	Well, functionally, as far as I'm concerned, nothing.
684560	686480	They're all spreading the same propaganda.
686480	689840	It doesn't matter what they call it or their reason for doing it.
689840	693600	If you associate with and support racists and parrot their opinions,
694240	699440	you're a racist, regardless of if you say or even think you are.
699440	702080	Now, does thinking this mean I'll sometimes label someone
702080	704080	a white nationalist or racist or whatever
704080	705680	who claims not to be one?
706480	708800	Sure. Do I care about that?
709520	710640	Not really.
710640	713120	You know, in my opinion, the burden of proof is on them
713120	715440	to act less like a white nationalist.
715440	718080	And for any fans of Steven Crowder who might be watching
718080	720320	who think I'm being unfair here,
720320	723920	consider the following clip from another of his videos.
723920	725440	So they don't believe in the First Amendment,
725440	728240	whereas white nationalists, when we address the Constitution,
728240	730960	don't believe that all people were created equal.
730960	733680	If you look at the Declaration of Independence, that's right in there.
733680	734720	They don't believe that.
735360	737840	They all agree on one thing.
738400	740480	Equality is a dangerous myth.
741360	744800	The alt-right is united in rejecting the current dogma
744800	746960	that all races are equal.
748080	749360	And I know people say he's alt-right.
749360	750880	That's- he's a white nationalist.
751520	755520	So who is this guy who Steven called alt-right and a white nationalist?
755520	757280	Well, that's Jared Taylor,
757280	761040	editor of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance.
761040	765840	Jared Taylor is a white supremacist and white nationalist and racist.
765840	769200	And Steven Crowder was correct to identify him as such.
769760	773120	However, Taylor has been described as a white nationalist,
773120	775840	white supremacist, and racist by civil rights groups,
775840	779120	news media, academics studying racism in the US, and others.
779840	781280	Many sources.
781280	784720	Taylor has strenuously rejected being called a racist
784720	789920	and maintains that he is instead a racialist who believes in race realism.
789920	790720	That's a good one.
791280	793920	He's also said that he's not a white supremacist,
793920	796560	describing himself as a white advocate,
796560	800000	and contends that his views on nationality and race are moderate,
800000	804400	commonsensical, and fully consistent with the views of most of the great statesmen
804400	806320	and presidents of America's past.
806320	809760	Yeah, mainly the ones who own slaves, I think you'll find.
809760	810960	Well, what's my point here?
810960	815200	Well, Steven Crowder clearly has no objection to calling a racist a racist
815200	817680	when he believes the term to be accurate,
817680	821840	even if they themselves would prefer the term racialist or whatever else.
821840	825200	He feels entitled to make that judgment call there,
825200	829520	and that's the same judgment call he's criticizing those on the left for making.
829520	831520	Now, given that Steven, in his video,
831520	836240	complains about people calling him a white supremacist or nationalist or whatever,
836240	839440	let's take a look at some possible reasons that might be.
839440	842160	And we'll stick with Jared Taylor here for a second.
842160	846960	So, we have on the line, and I guess for those of you video-based,
846960	848720	on the screen, Jared Taylor.
848720	851520	Now, Jared Taylor is the editor of American Renaissance,
851520	853440	the president of the New Century Foundation,
853440	856720	and the author of many books on race relations.
856720	858400	We're going to put links to those below.
858400	859440	I highly recommend them.
859440	864800	It's very data-driven, not ideological, very fact-based, and very eye-opening.
864800	869360	It's sort of chilling when you realize the degree to which essential information
869360	873040	for the improvement of race relations is kept hidden from people.
873040	878080	And the New Century Foundation recently released an updated version of,
878080	879520	I guess you could call it a pamphlet,
879520	882480	but a very data-driven presentation on the color of crime.
882480	884720	It's a report on differences in crime rates by race,
885280	888720	an examination of questions of bias in the justice system,
888720	891440	and, of course, interracial crime statistics.
892720	896960	So, that clip was of Jared Taylor being featured on Stefan Molyneux's YouTube channel,
896960	899520	with Stefan sharing Taylor's work with his audience
899520	902480	and linking in the description to his various websites.
902480	904880	Now, Stefan Molyneux is a white nationalist,
904880	907600	or at least a white nationalist sympathizer,
907600	912160	coming out as such in a documentary about a trip to Poland he made late last year.
912160	915360	First of all, I've always been skeptical of the ideas
915360	919680	of white nationalism, of identitarianism, and white identity.
920640	925120	However, I am an empiricist, and I could not help but notice
925760	932400	that I could have peaceful, free, easy, civilized, and safe discussions
932400	935280	in what is essentially an all-white country.
937600	941440	I've spoken out against white nationalism, but I'm an empiricist.
943200	943920	I'm listening.
945040	947600	I'm listening to my experiences, can't argue with the facts.
948160	950000	So, that's pretty blatant there.
950000	951840	He does do the whole, of course,
951840	954800	I've always been very skeptical of white nationalism routine,
954800	957680	so we can back away from it later if he's called out.
957680	961840	It's a wordier version of, I'm not a racist, but, you know.
961840	963920	He also calls himself an empiricist,
963920	966800	and then offers only anecdotal evidence for now thinking
966800	969600	that white nationalism is good, which is pretty funny.
969600	971680	So, why am I talking about Stefan Molyneux?
971680	975840	Well, if we can't always trust what people say when they tell us who they are,
975840	980480	how can we tell who is a white nationalist, or racist, or whatever else?
980480	986160	Well, we can ask ourselves, what sorts of things would we see a secret racist do?
986160	989040	Well, how about platform other racists,
989040	993200	and sell their work to your audience to financially support them?
993200	996080	And following on from that, Stefan Molyneux has been a guest
996080	998240	on Steven Crowder's show multiple times,
998240	1001120	and here's a clip of Molyneux advertising a book he wrote
1001120	1003360	on Steven Crowder's YouTube channel.
1003360	1005680	So, a note for YouTubers here.
1005680	1007920	Even if you totally disagree with someone,
1007920	1011920	and were planning to completely destroy them in debate with facts and logic,
1012560	1014480	you don't need to do this.
1014480	1018080	You know, have them on the show and let them advertise their merch.
1018640	1023120	You can debate Stefan Molyneux's opinions without once involving him.
1023120	1028240	This is never necessary, unless your goal is to support him financially.
1028240	1031360	So anyway, Steven calls Taylor a white nationalist,
1031360	1034880	but supports Stefan Molyneux financially and shares his work,
1034880	1038240	who then supports Taylor financially and shares his work.
1038240	1042880	The link from Steven Crowder to someone Steven Crowder considers a white nationalist
1042880	1046080	consists of one other white nationalist there.
1046080	1048560	Let's not draw any premature conclusions here, though.
1048560	1050160	Let's be a little more thorough.
1050160	1051200	So, okay.
1051200	1054560	The next behavior we might see a secret racist engage in
1054560	1058320	is downplaying the danger of white supremacy and white nationalism.
1058320	1061520	You know, you could say, I disavow it, of course,
1061520	1063760	but it's not really that big of a deal, is it?
1064400	1066800	What do you make of the whole white supremacy thing?
1066800	1069760	The idea that we even have to talk about this seems sort of ridiculous.
1069760	1074000	I just don't think, yes, I think there are some white supremacists,
1074000	1075680	as there always have been.
1075680	1077680	I don't think that there are Nazis running around.
1077680	1080960	Nazis were a political party in Germany in the 1930s.
1080960	1082160	They're not really running around now.
1082640	1085920	Yeah, and like half the people on sites like Stormfront are feds.
1086480	1088720	Like, it's a big joke online.
1088720	1092400	If you go, I spend a lot of time like in tons of different political communities,
1092400	1093760	on Facebook, just like reading it.
1093760	1096400	And if you go into any alt-right Facebook groups,
1096400	1099760	the joke is always if you post anything super Nazi or anything,
1099760	1101680	they're like, oh, fed, are you a fed, right?
1102480	1104080	They're like, no one does that in real life.
1104080	1106240	No one runs around with Nazi tattoos in real life.
1106240	1107040	You don't see it.
1107760	1110320	That's Dave Rubin and Lauren Southern there,
1110320	1112960	asking where on earth all the Nazis are
1112960	1116720	just a few months prior to the Unite the Right rally at Charlottesville.
1116720	1120320	You don't see people with swastika tattoos running around anymore.
1120320	1122720	Oh, no, there they are, there.
1122720	1124240	And they killed someone.
1124240	1126800	We don't know what we're talking about, clearly.
1126800	1128560	We were fatally incorrect.
1128560	1132160	We apologize and quit because we're obviously incompetent.
1133040	1134640	Now, that's my own fantasy.
1134640	1137280	There, I should make clear they didn't actually say that.
1137280	1139920	So how does this relate to Steven Crowder's video?
1139920	1142960	Well, firstly, his own website goes in pretty hard
1142960	1145360	on the Unite the Right attendees and organizers.
1145360	1148560	It here calls them the Charlottesville supremacists.
1148560	1153200	It calls Richard Spencer an asshole and an unapologetic white supremacist
1153200	1156320	and refers to his smug little Nazi face.
1156320	1158880	That article was shared by Steven Crowder on Twitter,
1158880	1161040	so we can assume he agrees with those statements.
1161600	1165520	So, okay, Steven Crowder has identified a Unite the Right attendee
1165520	1167520	as an actual white supremacist
1167520	1171440	and ran an article that called the organizer of the event a smug Nazi.
1172240	1173280	All good so far.
1174160	1177920	Returning to Lauren Southern, however, she would appear to disagree.
1178720	1180960	Well, you would agree that some of it exists, right?
1180960	1183200	Like, there's something there somewhere, that's right.
1183200	1185280	Yeah, even the Richard Spencers of the world,
1185280	1189440	like, even them, they're kind of misrepresented as well.
1189440	1192560	Like, Richard Spencer is not a white supremacist.
1192560	1193760	He is a white nationalist.
1193760	1195360	He believes in a white ethnostate.
1195360	1197920	He doesn't believe in whites being superior.
1197920	1202000	So Richard Spencer is not a white supremacist, apparently.
1202000	1204640	He's a white nationalist, according to Lauren Southern.
1205520	1206400	However...
1206400	1208400	And I don't identify as a white nationalist,
1208400	1211280	just to, you know, let that be known.
1211280	1213760	History is often a zero-sum game.
1213760	1217360	History is often about subordination and domination.
1217360	1220160	And it's about patronage and so on.
1220160	1222000	And if we want to try to get away from that
1222000	1223920	in order to be ideologically pure,
1223920	1226640	like, oh, every ethnicity will have its little state,
1226640	1228080	we're not going to really go anywhere.
1228080	1231840	So why would Lauren Southern lie about Richard Spencer's views?
1232480	1237360	Well, because she's trying to downplay the seriousness and danger of white supremacy,
1237360	1240000	because that furthers her political goals.
1240000	1243120	If more people believe there are no more white supremacists,
1243120	1247040	that's fewer people who could recognize her as a white supremacist.
1247040	1250480	You see, Lauren Southern pals around with various, air-quote,
1250480	1252320	identitarian groups,
1252320	1256800	most famously to interfere with migrant rescue operations in the Mediterranean.
1256800	1260480	She shared false information about the Quebec City mosque shooting on Twitter,
1260480	1263440	incorrectly identifying the shooters as Syrian refugees
1263440	1265920	when it was actually a far-right white nationalist.
1265920	1270880	She made a video popularizing the white supremacist Great Replacement conspiracy theory,
1270880	1274720	the same conspiracy theory that inspired the Christchurch mosque shootings
1274720	1277040	that killed more than 50 people in New Zealand.
1277040	1281120	The shooter titled his manifesto The Great Replacement, even.
1281760	1286160	And Lauren Southern is a frequent guest on Steven Crowder's show.
1286160	1290720	So again, we have someone who all but calls themselves a white nationalist,
1290720	1294240	who downplays the existence of Nazis and white supremacists
1294240	1296960	while sharing their conspiracy theories,
1296960	1299360	being supported by Steven Crowder.
1299360	1302800	But again, let's not jump the gun here, we'll keep going.
1302800	1306400	So this is Milo Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart contributor
1306400	1310400	who was fired from everything after he said child abuse was okay.
1310400	1313600	Here he is serenading a bunch of neo-Nazis in a bar,
1313680	1316400	including Richard Spencer throwing a Hitler salute.
1316400	1319440	Now in 2017, a bunch of Breitbart emails were leaked,
1319440	1323840	which included, among other things, a leak of Milo's password for his email account,
1323840	1326720	which was Long Knives 1290.
1326720	1329360	Now that's a reference to both the Night of the Long Knives,
1329360	1332160	which was a Nazi purge carried out by Adolf Hitler,
1332160	1334880	and the 1290 Edict of Expulsion,
1334880	1338160	a royal decree issued by King Edward I of England,
1338160	1340800	expelling all the Jews from his kingdom.
1340800	1342560	Well, you know the punchline by now.
1342560	1346640	Milo Yiannopoulos has appeared several times on Steven Crowder's show.
1346640	1349040	Moving on, this chap is Gavin McInnes,
1349040	1351760	founder of the far-right gang The Proud Boys.
1351760	1353360	And this is an easy one.
1353360	1356800	Here's a clip of Gavin McInnes calling himself anti-Semitic
1356800	1359200	and sympathizing with Holocaust deniers.
1360000	1362160	This is basically a brainwashing trip.
1362160	1365440	I mean, I think the Israeli government paid for this,
1366000	1369200	and we had donors too, but I think they were mostly Israelis
1369200	1372880	that assume that we're going to listen to all this shit, we get fed.
1373600	1377120	And that is having the reverse effect on me.
1377120	1380800	I'm becoming anti-Semitic, like at the Holocaust Museum,
1381680	1384160	or as I call it, the Holocaust Museum.
1384160	1384880	No, I'm just kidding.
1386720	1388480	Yeah, like at one point the tour guide goes,
1388480	1391040	you know, and there are people who think that this didn't happen.
1391680	1397520	And I felt myself defending the super far-right Nazis,
1397520	1400080	just because I was sick of being so much brainwashing,
1400080	1404080	and I felt like going, well, they never said it didn't happen.
1404080	1407040	What they're saying is that it was much less than six million,
1407040	1410880	and that they starved to death and they weren't gassed,
1410880	1413040	that they didn't have supplies.
1413040	1417440	Notice how Gavin downplays the actual beliefs of Holocaust deniers there,
1417440	1421440	because of course there are people who think the entire Holocaust was a hoax,
1421440	1426080	including Andrew Anglin from the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer,
1426080	1428080	who wrote about this clip saying,
1428080	1431920	I completely 100% endorse these statements.
1431920	1435200	Obviously I disagree with the Holocaust happened part,
1435200	1437600	but we can't really expect him not to say that
1437600	1440400	while he's literally still in Israel filming this.
1440400	1444720	Everything else is totally and completely on point and awesome,
1444720	1447280	which is not a sentence you want The Daily Stormer
1447280	1450000	to ever say about any of your opinions.
1450000	1454080	Gavin McInnes also wrote about Richard Spencer back in 2016 saying,
1454080	1458560	I've known alt-right pioneer Richard Spencer since he got me the job at this magazine,
1458560	1464000	and even he, the head of the snake, comes across as perfectly reasonable in conversation.
1464000	1467680	He doesn't think non-whites can be included in a harmonious America,
1470480	1470980	but...
1473280	1476080	everything else on his plate is relatively civil.
1476080	1479680	Gavin McInnes has also provided a platform to Jared Taylor.
1479680	1482640	The main researcher on this is Edward Rubenstein.
1482640	1485760	He's a very well-known economist and researcher.
1485760	1488240	He did a really fantastic, thorough job.
1488240	1488740	So...
1488740	1491040	Sounds like, uh, hee-hee!
1492240	1494240	What's this?
1494560	1497760	That's my, uh, Jew, uh, finger thing.
1497760	1503120	And of course, Gavin McInnes is a frequent contributor to Steven Crowder's show.
1503120	1507520	All right, next up we have Owen Benjamin, who is a comedian, apparently.
1507520	1510960	Now, Owen has been on Steven Crowder's show multiple times,
1510960	1515440	even filling in as host of the show when Steven Crowder wasn't available.
1515440	1518880	So you'd imagine he's a pretty trusted person around those parts
1518880	1521200	if they let him in the driver's seat, right?
1521200	1526720	Now, Owen Benjamin also does his own internet web streams on YouTube,
1526720	1529520	and let's take a peek at one of those.
1529520	1531040	But it wasn't gas chambers.
1531040	1533760	It wasn't extermination based on race.
1533760	1539440	What if it literally was work will set you free work, motherfucker,
1540000	1540720	and they died?
1542160	1544400	That's infinitely more probable.
1544400	1546400	If you're a dictator, right?
1547280	1549120	Why would you kill your slaves?
1549120	1551680	Well, I have another artist that I'm a big fan of.
1551680	1552180	Hitler.
1552640	1553840	He was a great artist.
1553840	1555200	He was also a great writer.
1555200	1556880	Mein Kampf and all his paintings.
1557440	1560080	Really, what he was trying to do is clean Germany.
1560080	1562560	Clean it of the parasites, of the fleas.
1562560	1564480	He was not, he did not hate Jews.
1564480	1565440	He hated filth.
1565440	1566880	And he was trying to clean up.
1566880	1569920	And I'm not sure there's much I need to say about that.
1569920	1572640	So, to Steven Crowder, I'll say this.
1572640	1575680	If you want people to not call you a racist,
1575680	1579520	maybe stop inviting racists onto your YouTube show that you do.
1579520	1584560	And if you're confused about who is and is not a white nationalist or white supremacist,
1584560	1586720	maybe before whining about the left,
1586720	1591600	you should ask the various guests who come on your show to define those terms.
1591600	1594560	Because if sympathizing with white nationalism,
1594560	1598960	platforming racists, sharing white supremacist propaganda,
1598960	1600560	questioning the Holocaust,
1600560	1606240	and outright saying Hitler was good don't make you a racist or white supremacist,
1607200	1608320	what does, man?
1609200	1610800	A big swastika tattoo?
1610800	1612480	That's, that's it, isn't it?
1612480	1615360	It's just the big swastika tattoo.
1615360	1620480	Now, I'm certain some Steven Crowder fans will protest my last two examples there,
1620480	1622720	Gavin McInnes and Owen Benjamin,
1622720	1625760	because they've quite recently been in trouble with Blaze TV,
1625760	1628800	the network that hosts Steven Crowder's show.
1628800	1632160	So if the network doesn't want to work with those people anymore,
1632160	1638000	surely that's them being disciplined for their racist behavior and all is well, right?
1638000	1640720	However, Steven Crowder was apparently worried
1640720	1645680	about being made out to be some network stooge following Blaze TV orders.
1645680	1648720	So he addressed both of these controversies publicly.
1648720	1650000	Listen, this is Mug Club.
1650000	1651440	We're funded by you, the viewer at Mug.
1651440	1655120	So let me tell you, I had no idea about a lot of this stuff going on, okay?
1655760	1657360	I've never worked for the Blaze.
1657360	1658560	I don't work for the Blaze.
1659200	1660560	This is something that is separate,
1660560	1663520	where we actually allow you to get more value for your, for your buck,
1664320	1666560	in agreement with CRTV, I guess now the Blaze,
1666560	1668080	where you get more content.
1668080	1671360	I didn't know about the Gavin McInnes situation until you did.
1671360	1672400	And let me be really clear,
1672400	1677200	Gavin McInnes has an open seat and invitation to work on a permanent basis here on this show,
1677200	1678080	if he wants to.
1678080	1680560	He knows, and by the way, also do his own show.
1680560	1682560	And by the way, it has, I want to make sure this is really clear.
1682560	1684880	Owen was never let go from this show.
1685520	1688640	Owen could still write for this show, and I, I love him.
1688640	1690160	Owen's a brilliant writer.
1690160	1694240	So Steven Crowder is happy to keep working with these people, apparently.
1694240	1697440	Gavin McInnes is still guesting on his show.
1697440	1700320	So, you know, make of that what you will.
1700320	1704160	I'd like now to talk about Steven's various comparative statements
1704160	1707520	he makes throughout the video, so let's have a listen to a couple.
1708080	1712400	"...is believing that the United States is believing that America is superior to Mexico.
1712400	1713200	White supremacy.
1714000	1717280	What if I were to say that white people, on average,
1718080	1721760	have higher IQ scores than black people, on average?
1722560	1724320	Is that white supremacy?"
1724320	1729600	So then, did those statements what Steven Crowder said make him a racist?
1729600	1734560	Well, I've actually explained my thoughts about such statements in a fairly old video of mine,
1734560	1736640	but I'll give the short answer here.
1736640	1739920	It depends on the context in which the statements were said.
1739920	1741760	So let's take the statement,
1741760	1745680	black people, on average, have lower IQ scores than white people.
1745680	1749040	Now, I'm gonna say that again in two different contexts,
1749040	1750960	and we'll see if we can spot the difference.
1751600	1752560	So, okay.
1752560	1756400	Black people, on average, have lower IQ scores than white people.
1756400	1761200	However, lacking equal access to education and economic equality,
1761200	1764880	this statement by itself can tell us nothing about any possible differences
1764960	1768480	in cognitive ability inherent to black and white people.
1768480	1773360	Without accounting for social influences, this statement is practically useless.
1773360	1777040	I could also go into the problems with IQ as a measure of intelligence here,
1777040	1779520	and especially the problems with the book The Bell Curve,
1779520	1782960	which is the study mentioned in the screenshot that Crowder shows.
1782960	1786560	However, I have a whole video dedicated to The Bell Curve in the works,
1786560	1790560	and I don't want to spoil it here, so I'll just say it's rubbish.
1790560	1794800	So okay, let's say that phrase again, but in the manner of a clueless racist.
1794800	1799040	I want to create a white ethnostate and kick out all of the black people,
1799040	1802960	because black people, on average, have lower IQ scores than white people.
1802960	1807360	You see, I said the same words, Stephen, but in a different context.
1807360	1810800	Whether or not they're racist depends on why you're saying them.
1810800	1815760	So I suppose the pertinent question here is, in what context did you say them?
1815760	1818880	Well, they're in a video, the goal of which is to create the impression
1818880	1823120	that the terms white nationalist and white supremacist have lost all their meaning,
1823120	1827360	hosted on the same channel that features you doing things like this.
1827360	1828880	Of China.
1828880	1830880	Miso Hori!
1840880	1847040	So, yes, I deem this a pretty racist context in which to say those statements.
1847040	1850000	Running defense for racists is racist.
1850640	1855920	Platforming other racists on your show is racist, and I shouldn't have to say this one,
1855920	1860240	but dressing up as offensive racial stereotypes is racist.
1861680	1864160	Steven Crowder's a racist, basically.
1864160	1869280	Now, to be fair, Crowder's show's primary purpose seems not to be any conscious attempt
1869280	1871840	to spread racist beliefs for their own sake.
1871840	1877120	The show is more of a hastily constructed anti-left stream of consciousness,
1877120	1881360	made for what can be mockingly referred to as entertainment purposes.
1881360	1885760	It turns out, though, that if you're in the anti-left pro-right entertainment game,
1885760	1888880	there's just a lot of overlap with being a racist.
1888880	1890800	And there's no difference functionally,
1890800	1894160	so, you know, it doesn't really matter whether they're consciously doing it or not.
1894160	1896480	To paraphrase a famous quote here,
1896480	1899600	don't believe people when they tell you who they are.
1899600	1902480	Believe people when they show you who they are.
1902480	1905760	Steven Crowder can disavow racism a million times,
1905840	1910720	and it won't mean anything if you keep sharing his platform with racists and white nationalists.
1910720	1916240	All we can infer from that is that either he's a racist or a white nationalist or a white supremacist.
1918560	1920640	Thanks a lot for watching, folks.
1920640	1923920	There is one question left I haven't answered yet, however.
1923920	1928880	Who should be banned by all those evil, lefty tech CEOs?
1929600	1934720	Well, I happen to think that every white nationalist, white supremacist or racist,
1934720	1937840	should be banned by every website they ever use.
1937840	1940800	Now, how can I defend thinking that?
1940800	1943760	Well, it's because I believe in freedom of speech.
1943760	1948080	The idea that you can have a social media community in which everyone,
1948080	1953680	racists and racial minorities, homophobes and gay people, transphobes and trans people,
1953680	1959520	all freely discourse and speak their minds equally, is a doomed liberal fantasy.
1959520	1962560	If you let the KKK recruit on your website,
1962640	1967360	black people, understandably, aren't gonna trust you and they'll not want to use it.
1967360	1973280	If you signal to your user base that harassing gay people doesn't violate your terms of service,
1973280	1977760	gay people will not feel safe expressing themselves on your platform.
1977760	1982320	This is a much worse affront to free speech than banning a few bigotses.
1982320	1987440	We can't be tolerant of intolerance here, we have to pick a side, necessarily.
1987440	1992800	Trying to keep everyone on board, which is the strategy favored by capitalist corporations,
1992800	1996480	obviously, as that's the scenario with the theoretical largest return,
1996480	1998720	even if it's unworkable in the long run,
1998720	2004400	can only lead to that community eventually being overrun by intolerant bigots.
2004400	2007280	So the solution is fairly simple, really.
2007920	2009040	Just ban them all.
2009680	2012560	And if they don't like it, fuck them.
