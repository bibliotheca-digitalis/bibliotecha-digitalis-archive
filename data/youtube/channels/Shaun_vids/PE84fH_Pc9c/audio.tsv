0	6240	Hello, everyone. So, today I'm gonna talk about the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman.
6240	11440	But I feel like I need to explain myself and justify this a little before we get going here.
11440	17120	It'd be fair to ask, why now, five years later, do you wanna talk about this?
17120	20480	And the answer there is that I still believe it to be relevant.
20480	25360	The generalities of the incident, a black person, in this case Trayvon Martin,
25360	29120	is killed by a white person, in this case George Zimmerman,
29360	32720	in unclear or ambiguous circumstances.
32720	38160	And then later, the killer receives either no or relatively little legal punishment.
38160	42800	The names and the locations change, but the general outline remains the same.
43600	48640	And the feeling held by a lot of black people and more racially conscious people of other races
48640	53120	is that these people probably would not have been killed had they been white,
53120	55200	or if they had still been killed,
55200	58880	the justice system would have treated the killers much less leniently.
59200	61280	And this can be a hard thing to prove.
61280	64560	We're talking about certain likelihoods and probabilities,
65280	68000	subconscious or otherwise hidden biases,
68000	72800	and we don't have another America in which Trayvon Martin was a white teenager
72800	77280	walking home from the store to see what would have happened differently were that the case.
77840	83120	It's also easy to examine only the particulars of each incident in isolation,
83120	85840	and therefore avoid considering the overall trends.
86560	90240	Each case is easy to excuse if you're looking for excuses.
90800	95920	Trayvon Martin hit George Zimmerman, so Zimmerman was justified in defending himself.
95920	100880	Tamir Rice had a toy gun, and you know, that could have been mistaken for a real gun,
100880	103600	so, you know, therefore, etc.
104240	108000	There's always an excuse, however valid that excuse is,
108000	111200	with the cases that receive a lot of media attention.
111200	115040	A useful comparison here is the shooting of Levar Edward Jones.
115120	118480	Now, this shooting was not a particularly high-profile case.
118480	122720	A Google search for Levar Edward Jones only gives 1300 results,
122720	127200	compared to the 1.6 million for Trayvon Martin, for instance,
127200	130880	and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people hadn't heard of this shooting.
130880	133040	So, a very brief overview then.
133040	136000	On September the 4th of 2014,
136000	140880	South Carolina State Trooper Sean Grubert pulled up behind Levar Edward Jones
140880	143120	as he accessed his vehicle at a gas station.
143840	146880	Grubert asked Jones to get his license and registration,
146880	148480	and when Jones reached for them,
148480	152320	Grubert panicked and pulled his gun and fired several times,
152320	154000	hitting Jones in the hip.
154000	157600	Now, I'll link the video in the description and avoid showing it here,
157600	159600	but it's pretty much as I described.
160160	163920	So why didn't this case get as much media attention as some others?
163920	165760	Well, there's a few factors,
165760	168960	and they're all rather depressing to think about, to be honest.
169680	172880	The first is that there is a clear record of the incident.
172880	176400	It happened in plain sight in view of Grubert's dashcam.
177120	180000	The second is that the person who was shot survived
180000	182240	and could thus later argue their case.
182880	186000	And the third is that Grubert was very quickly fired,
186000	189040	arrested, and charged with felony assault and battery.
189040	192000	So there's very little to argue about this case.
192000	193440	It's clear-cut.
193440	196240	The person who was shot was entirely innocent,
196240	198880	the police officer was clearly in the wrong,
198880	200080	and that's the end of that.
200080	202480	You know, there's no excuse for that one.
202480	204320	And that's the important thing here,
204320	207120	there not being an excuse or a justification.
207840	212480	But let's imagine an alternate version of the shooting of Levar Edward Jones.
212480	215200	What if the gunshot had been fatal
215200	218960	and the person who was shot wasn't around to tell his side of the story?
219600	222640	And what if the dashcam had been angled slightly differently
222640	224400	or didn't pick up the incident?
224400	229760	Or, alternatively, what if the dashcam footage had been not so mysteriously lost?
230400	233120	Uh, well then the officer in this imaginary case
233120	237040	could have then said anything he liked to justify the shooting.
237040	240240	He looked dangerous, he said he was gonna kill me,
240240	244720	he grabbed for my gun, whatever, and there's the justification.
244720	249840	Now we see that blame is always individualized in these sorts of incidents.
249840	253840	The black person who was shot or killed is always considered at fault
253840	258400	up until it's an obvious and unavoidable fact that they were innocent.
258400	262160	Now, completely absent from this framework are societal factors
262160	266400	or racial biases or any sort of wider consideration of trends.
267280	269600	Only one person can be at fault.
269600	273520	It's either the person who was shot or the person who did the shooting,
273520	275280	and that's the end of that.
275280	277840	And so we come to the point of my video.
277840	281840	This video is aimed at people who might subconsciously even
281840	286000	reach for the easy excuse to justify these kinds of incidents.
286000	290880	Now, I don't think these people are capital R racists necessarily,
290880	294480	just that they might be harboring some biases that can be exposed
294480	298880	with a little effort and a bit of deeper thinking about the topic.
298880	303760	And we're gonna examine one case in particular, the shooting of Trayvon Martin.
303760	307680	We're gonna look at the various justifications given for Zimmerman's actions
307680	312640	and see if they hold water, and then afterwards I've come up with a clever way,
312640	318640	if I do say so myself, of proving that bias exists in reactions to cases like this.
318640	320480	So stick about if you want to see that.
321360	325920	My intention here is that by getting people to stop and think about just one case,
325920	329360	they might not be so quick to jump to conclusions for similar cases.
329920	333120	My hope is that this video can be linked to people who might try
333120	335840	to excuse the actions of George Zimmerman,
335840	339760	and hopefully they'll sit through it and maybe take a few points on board.
339760	345200	So okay, I'll start out here by giving an as-neutral-as-possible account of the incident.
345840	350320	On February 26th, 2012, Trayvon Martin,
350320	354720	who was visiting family at the Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Florida,
355280	358320	walked to a local store at about 7 p.m.
358880	362080	On his return from the store, he was spotted by George Zimmerman,
362080	364480	the organizer of the local neighborhood watch,
364480	367440	who mistook him for a criminal and called the police.
368160	372960	Zimmerman described Martin as looking as if he was up to no good and possibly on drugs.
373520	375600	After observing Martin for a time,
375600	379600	Zimmerman left his vehicle to continue to follow him when he moved out of sight.
380240	384560	This was followed by the police dispatcher asking Zimmerman if he was following Martin,
384560	386880	to which Zimmerman replied that he was.
387520	389920	The dispatcher then asked him not to do that.
390560	396560	Zimmerman was also armed with a 9mm handgun for which he had a concealed carry permit.
396560	399040	After being unable to locate Martin,
399040	402160	Zimmerman entered his call with the police dispatcher,
402160	405600	instructing them to call him back when an officer arrived on the scene.
406240	408080	Shortly after ending the call,
408080	413360	Zimmerman and Martin met at the top of the T-shaped intersection between the rows of houses.
413920	418400	A physical altercation ensued during which Zimmerman received a nosebleed
418400	421120	and some light abrasive wounds to the back of his head,
421120	423840	and Trayvon Martin was shot fatally in the chest.
424400	427520	Police arrived on the scene shortly thereafter.
427520	429920	So that's the basic outline of the events,
429920	432800	containing only the facts that are beyond dispute.
432800	436480	Of course, quite a few other things happened, or probably happened,
436480	439120	but those need to be talked about in more detail.
439120	441440	So what do we think about this incident?
441440	446800	Well, let me start by saying that I agree with Zimmerman being found not guilty at trial.
446800	450400	Now, that is not because I do not believe him to be at fault.
450400	451280	Because he was.
451920	453040	He definitely was.
453600	455920	But I believe he was overcharged.
455920	458880	Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder,
458880	462640	which requires the prosecution to prove beyond the reasonable doubt
462640	466000	that Zimmerman intended to kill Trayvon Martin.
466000	470480	And without an eyewitness to the start of the physical altercation, as we'll see,
470480	472960	that is impossible to prove in court.
472960	476560	The start of the altercation is what is important here.
476560	480400	You see, the first justification for the shooting of Trayvon Martin
480400	482160	is that he injured Zimmerman,
482160	485440	and therefore Zimmerman could have reasonably feared for his life,
485440	487600	and thus was in the clear to defend himself.
488320	490560	Now, the problem with this argument is that
490560	494960	that same justification for Zimmerman's actions also works in reverse.
495520	497600	Trayvon Martin was also injured.
498320	501040	Much worse than Zimmerman, he was fatally injured,
501040	502960	and therefore, by the same logic,
502960	507840	he was legally in the clear to kill Zimmerman in self-defense as well.
507840	510560	So we're in a weird legal limbo here.
510560	515360	It certainly can't be the case that two people are just legally allowed to fight to the death
515360	517520	because they both fear for their own lives.
517520	522240	So what matters here is who initiated the physical altercation.
522880	526240	Without knowing that, Zimmerman's injuries could have been inflicted
526240	529760	by Trayvon Martin acting legally in self-defense.
529760	532160	And a lot of people who were outraged by this case
532160	534320	probably fought with some justification
534320	538160	that a stranger following you at night and chasing you down a dark alley
538160	541360	was itself enough to justify defending yourself physically.
542160	547600	As for actual hard courtroom evidence, though, we have relatively little to go on.
547600	549920	We have Zimmerman's account of the incident,
549920	552960	told through his written statement, his interviews with the police,
552960	556400	and a recorded walkthrough of the event conducted the following day.
556400	562000	But that is obviously not reliable by itself for what I hope are obvious reasons.
562000	565760	Also, Zimmerman provably lies at several times
565760	569760	during his recounting of the incident, which we'll get to shortly.
569760	574080	So without a witness to or recording of Zimmerman starting the fight,
574080	578560	and with no other indication that Zimmerman actually wanted to kill Martin,
578560	581680	there isn't really enough here for a murder conviction.
581680	585680	What you can prove is that Zimmerman was in the wrong at several points.
585680	589360	He was incorrect in his profiling of Martin as a criminal.
589360	592720	He was incorrect to leave his vehicle to pursue Martin.
592720	596560	He had several times acted recklessly and idiotically,
596560	601280	but that doesn't prove he actually wanted to murder Trayvon Martin.
601280	604240	And indeed, if we read the Sanford Police Department's report
604240	608560	after they eventually decided to recommend charging Zimmerman with something,
608560	612720	they said there is probable cause for charging Zimmerman with manslaughter,
612720	613520	stating,
613520	616560	"...the encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin
616560	618960	was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman.
618960	623040	If he had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement,
623040	627040	or conversely, if he'd identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen
627040	630720	and initiated dialogue in an effort to dispel each party's concerns,
631600	635840	there is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity
635840	637280	at the time of the encounter."
637280	642560	And yes, the prosecutors would have had a much easier time proving manslaughter in court,
642560	647200	mainly because of all the aforementioned lies that Zimmerman can be shown to have told.
647200	653200	So, let's talk about some of those and also examine another anti-Treyvon Martin argument,
653200	656800	this one being that during the time Zimmerman was on the phone,
656800	660720	Trayvon Martin had enough time to get home to safety.
660720	666480	And people generally use this fact to suggest that since Trayvon Martin did not return home immediately,
666480	670880	he was therefore looking to ambush or otherwise confront Zimmerman.
670880	674000	Now, one can come up with several possible scenarios
674000	677600	for why Martin did not return home immediately.
677600	680240	Firstly, he was on the phone to a friend at the time,
680240	684400	so maybe he simply wanted to finish his conversation before reaching the house,
684400	686240	and so he paused early.
686240	691200	Secondly, maybe he was sufficiently freaked out by the strange guy who was following him around
691200	694880	and decided that leading that person to his house might be a bad idea.
695520	699920	Remember, Martin had no clue who Zimmerman was or why he was following him,
699920	702560	so that is another possible scenario.
702560	706480	These possibilities, though, are actually entirely unnecessary.
707360	712480	Let's go with the idea that Trayvon Martin did hide or even walked all the way home
712480	716800	before changing his mind and deciding he was gonna confront Zimmerman.
716800	721120	So he marched right back up the path with the intention of doing just that.
721120	725920	Now, the problem here is that confront does not mean attack,
725920	728000	and it certainly does not mean kill.
729120	731520	Martin does not know what's going on, remember.
731520	733680	He doesn't know that the police have been called,
733680	737440	or that Zimmerman has a gun, or that he's about to be shot with it.
737440	741360	He's under no legal responsibility to do anything in particular,
741360	743120	so long as he does not break the law.
743680	745760	He does not have to return home.
745760	748560	He can walk up and down the street all night if he likes,
748560	753360	and there's nothing illegal about approaching someone to ask why they're following you.
753360	758800	Criticizing Martin for not returning home immediately is cynically placing the blame on him
758800	761920	for not anticipating and avoiding his own killing.
762560	765840	Even if Martin did double back to confront Zimmerman,
765840	770560	that still tells us nothing about who initiated the physical confrontation.
770560	775280	Secondly here, this criticism of Martin's actions also applies equally,
775280	777360	or even more so, to Zimmerman.
778000	782480	The top of the T intersection is much closer to where Zimmerman's truck was parked
782480	784800	than where Trayvon Martin's house was,
784800	788480	and Zimmerman had the exact same amount of time to get back to his truck
788480	790160	if that's what he wished to do.
790880	795680	If you're going to criticize Trayvon Martin for still being present when Zimmerman got off the phone,
795680	799360	then you have to apply that criticism to Zimmerman also.
799360	803360	Unlike Martin, however, Zimmerman is still around to inform us
803360	807520	why he was still in the alley between the houses instead of back at his truck,
807520	812640	and his explanation for still being there, as it turns out, makes no sense whatsoever.
813280	816720	Firstly, let's go through the transcript of Zimmerman's call to the police
816720	819040	and highlight all the relevant information.
819040	822400	Then we'll look at Zimmerman's walkthrough of the events the next day
822400	824160	and compare the two accounts.
824160	827440	So, the relevant parts of the police call are as follows.
827440	832320	Firstly, Zimmerman gives the dispatcher the address of the clubhouse at Retreat View Circle.
832880	836720	Then later in the call, he gives the more precise location of his truck.
836720	841040	Go straight past the clubhouse, make a left, and then past the mailboxes.
841040	842400	That's where his truck was.
843120	846800	Then the dispatcher asks what address Zimmerman is parked in front of,
847440	851280	one time, and Zimmerman responds that he does not know.
851280	854960	And at the end of the call, the following exchange takes place.
854960	859360	The dispatcher asks Zimmerman if he wants to meet the police near the mailboxes
859360	862960	where his truck is, and Zimmerman agrees at first.
863600	866880	But then when the dispatcher attempts to confirm this meeting place,
867440	869520	Zimmerman changes his mind and says,
869600	882160	Now let's look at the recording of Zimmerman's reenactment to the incident for the police,
882160	885360	because there are a few key points where his account differs here.
899520	918640	At this interaction, where the dispatcher asks Zimmerman if he can get to somewhere
918640	922400	he can see Trayvon Martin is not in the transcript,
922400	928800	and is likely a later embellishment by Zimmerman to justify his continued following of Martin in his truck.
930000	940480	I saw him walking back that way and then cut through the back of the houses.
941120	944240	He looked back and he noticed me and he cut back through the houses.
944240	951200	I was still on the phone with non-emergency and then he came back and he started walking
951200	956560	up towards the grass and then came down and circled my car and I told the operator that
956560	962400	he was circling my car. I didn't hear if he said anything, but he had his hand in his waistband.
962400	967520	At this interaction, where Zimmerman observes Martin circle his truck and informs the operator
967520	972640	about it, is not present in the transcript. Zimmerman does mention that Martin is looking
972640	977440	at him at one point, but at no point mentions Martin circle the truck.
977440	982240	It's unlikely that Martin would have had enough time to do this in the brief time in the call
982240	988800	before Zimmerman left his truck, and also unlikely Zimmerman would not have mentioned it to the dispatcher.
988800	993760	This is likely a later embellishment in order to make Martin appear more threatening.
993760	998960	And I think I told the operator that and they said where are you?
998960	1003760	And I could not remember the name of the street because I don't live on this street.
1003760	1010400	Retreat view circle goes in a circle. And I said I don't know and he goes we need an address.
1010400	1017440	And I said I don't know an address. I think I gave them my address. And they said give us
1017440	1022800	directions to get to you. And I said if you tell the police to go straight at the clubhouse and
1022800	1027440	make a left my truck will be there. And again they asked me where he went and what direction he went.
1027440	1032720	And I said I don't know. And then I thought to get out and look for a street sign.
1032720	1034720	So I got out of my car and I started walking.
1034720	1036720	Go ahead.
1053840	1057920	I was still on the phone with non-emergency and I started walking.
1057920	1059920	Okay.
1059920	1069360	And because I didn't see a street sign here but I knew if I went straight through that that's retreat view circle.
1069360	1074160	And I can give him an address. He said just give me the address of the house you're in front of.
1074160	1078160	And there's no address because this is the back of the house.
1078160	1080160	So it works here.
1081200	1085840	At firstly the dispatcher does not repeatedly ask for an address in the transcript.
1085840	1090800	This is a fabrication by Zimmerman in order to create a pretext for him to leave the car.
1091600	1095120	Secondly his described actions here make no sense.
1095120	1100000	I mean we're first expected to believe that a man who has lived in the neighborhood for several years
1100000	1105600	and is the self-appointed head of the neighborhood watch can't remember what street he's on in a
1105600	1112080	neighborhood with free streets. That seems rather unlikely to me but whatever.
1112080	1117600	Next up Zimmerman is parked on Twin Trees Lane and claims he can't give an address because he's
1117600	1124320	at the back of the houses. But as he's saying this we can see behind him some houses which do face
1124320	1129440	onto Twin Trees Lane. So his claim that he has to walk through to retreat view circle in order to
1129440	1134880	find an address is clearly incorrect. He could just look at the much closer houses that do
1134880	1141040	actually face onto Twin Trees Lane. So that's when I walked straight through here to get the address
1141040	1147120	so that I could meet the police officer and then they said uh I said he's not here they said do
1147120	1151440	you still want him to come and I said yes and they said where do you want him to come to and I said
1151440	1156720	you know what just tell him to meet me at my truck next to the clubhouse if you go straight
1156720	1160560	in through the clubhouse it makes a left I have a Honda original I'm silver Honda original I was
1160560	1166400	parked right there I'll meet him right there so I started walking back. This interaction in which
1166480	1171600	Zimmerman informs the dispatcher that he wants to meet the police by his truck is the actual
1171600	1176880	opposite of what appears in the transcript. The dispatcher is the one to suggest that and
1176880	1183280	Zimmerman instead proposes them calling him back to see where he is. This lie is also repeated in
1183280	1187360	one of the police interviews where Zimmerman claims the dispatcher asked where he wanted
1187360	1194560	to meet the police and he said at his car. So what does all this add up to? Well I think it's fairly
1194560	1201440	clear that all this rubbish about needing to find an address is an obvious fabrication. The dispatcher
1201440	1206960	already had an address they were directing police to and at no point asked Zimmerman to go walking
1206960	1212800	to find another one and even if they had done that there were much closer addresses available for
1212800	1218080	Zimmerman to go and check and even if Zimmerman had needed to walk through to retreat view circle
1218800	1224080	he lived on retreat view circle and I simply refused to believe that he forgot the name of his
1224080	1228880	own street and needed to go and physically look at a street sign to see where he was.
1228880	1234800	Now the probable truth is simply that Zimmerman was still looking for Trayvon Martin intending to
1234800	1242400	be the hero and catch the bad guy because quote these assholes always get away. Now Zimmerman also
1242400	1247520	tells several lies relating to the initial confrontation between him and Martin and let's
1247520	1253680	take a look at those. Firstly there is a major discrepancy in Zimmerman's story about the location
1253680	1259440	where he was knocked down by Martin. From his written statement he says as I headed back to
1259440	1267680	my vehicle the suspect emerged from the darkness and said you got a problem I said no the suspect
1267680	1275360	said you do now as I looked and tried to find my phone to dial 911 the suspect punched me in the
1275360	1282560	face I fell backwards onto my back the suspect got on top of me. So Zimmerman here makes it sound as
1282560	1286960	if he was immediately dropped by the first punch and this is echoed in his interview with the
1286960	1293360	police he punched me in the nose at that point I fell down were you still standing at this point
1294080	1301280	no ma'am okay I fell to the ground when he punched me the first time. So that's Zimmerman
1301280	1307280	restating and confirming that he fell at the first hit and here's why this makes no sense
1307280	1312880	if Zimmerman really was walking back to his truck from retreat view circle where he was apparently
1312880	1316080	looking for a street sign to tell him what the name of the street he lived on was called
1316640	1322080	and if he was doing that he would only need to walk across the top of the t intersection to get
1322080	1326720	back to the truck. Now the problem with this account is that Martin's body was found a few
1326720	1332400	houses down the path between the buildings here's a photograph taken from around the location where
1332400	1338240	Zimmerman first claimed he fell to the ground showing Martin's body in the distance. So what
1338240	1343840	does this mean? Well either Zimmerman's story about meeting Trayvon at the top of the intersection
1343840	1348160	is untrue and he was actually punched to the ground 40 feet down the path between the buildings
1348160	1353840	with no explanation of why he should be there or his story about being dropped with the first punch
1353840	1358320	is untrue because if he'd fell to the ground at the top of the intersection then Trayvon Martin's
1358320	1364080	body being found a few houses down the path makes no sense and let's watch Zimmerman realize in
1364080	1370240	real time that this aspect of his story is a load of old crap. He was about there but he was walking
1370240	1378480	towards me. Yes sir I believe like I said I was already past that so I didn't see exactly where
1378480	1384640	he came from but he was about where you were and I said I don't have a problem and I went to go grab
1384640	1390320	my cell phone but my I left it in a different pocket and I went I looked down in my hand pocket
1390320	1395760	and he said you got a problem now and then he was here and he punched me in the face right here
1396560	1404960	right around here okay to be honest I don't remember exactly that's why I think I stumbled
1406240	1411840	and I fell down he pushed me down somehow he got on top of me on the grass or on the snow
1412800	1419760	it was over more over towards here I think I was trying to push him away from me and then
1421120	1425600	he got on top of me somewhere around here and
1430560	1435840	Now all of this trying to push him away from me while moving down the path stuff is completely
1435840	1441280	absent from any of Zimmerman's earlier accounts of the incident and is also a bit suspect by
1441280	1447280	itself. If Zimmerman was trying to escape why didn't he go to the lit street where his truck
1447280	1453760	was? You know why instead move further down the dark path towards Trayvon Martin's house
1453760	1459840	incidentally? I don't know. It's a possibility obviously but the fact that Zimmerman neglected
1459840	1463680	to mention this in his written statement and police interviews and made it sound as though
1463680	1469520	he was knocked down immediately makes me doubt his story here. Zimmerman also undersells the
1469520	1475760	distance down the path that he fell to the ground. He moves to about the location of this tree but
1475760	1480320	we can see from the image that Martin's body was actually found about another house length past the
1480320	1485680	tree. Now okay it was dark and a traumatic experience so I can't expect Zimmerman to be
1485680	1490480	that accurate but it is still worth pointing out that Zimmerman's account in this recorded
1490480	1495520	walkthrough contradicts both his previous statements and the crime scene photographs.
1496080	1503440	So why would Zimmerman lie here? He asked with mock sincerity. Well obviously because he's trying
1503440	1508800	to give himself the best possible justification for his actions. Zimmerman's account includes
1508800	1514320	Martin being the first aggressor which is very important but also Martin explicitly telling
1514320	1520000	Zimmerman that he was going to kill him and then reaching for Zimmerman's gun and I mean why not
1520000	1524640	right? If you're the only witness to a shooting you committed you may as well make it airtight.
1524640	1530320	I'm surprised you didn't have Trayvon Martin say, I Trayvon Martin hereby pledge to kill you and
1530320	1535440	will do so shortly. This therefore gives you the full legal justification to respond with lethal
1535440	1540400	force and defense of your own life. I mean you know why not? Now the idea that Trayvon Martin
1540400	1546080	would at first run away from Zimmerman and then see red and decide to double back and actually
1546080	1551520	murder him strains belief somewhat. I mean I don't believe Zimmerman chased down Martin
1551520	1557440	intending to kill him in some racist rage but nor do I believe that Trayvon Martin while he was
1557440	1563120	still on the phone to a friend mind silently decided to double back and murder Zimmerman.
1563120	1569120	So what do we think actually happened? Well we're admittedly moving into the realm of speculation
1569120	1574320	here. I do have a theory of what was probably the most likely version of events and I'll give that
1574320	1579760	here for whatever good it's worth. So Zimmerman isn't looking for a street sign obviously and
1579760	1583600	nor is he intending to be where his truck currently is and we know that because of the
1583600	1588800	end of Zimmerman's police call. So he's still poking about looking for Martin, he doesn't want
1588800	1595120	this asshole to get away. Then him and Martin meet on the intersection behind the houses.
1595120	1599680	Zimmerman's friend who he was still on the phone with testified in court that at this point Martin
1599760	1606480	stated Zimmerman was still following him. So that backs up this theory of what Zimmerman was up to.
1606480	1612800	So let's get into Zimmerman's mindset here. He thinks Martin is a dangerous criminal suspect.
1612800	1617920	He's up to no good. He might be on drugs and Zimmerman states he's got his hand in his
1617920	1623840	waistband and later something's wrong with him. He's got something in his hands indicating he
1623840	1630480	thinks Martin might be armed. So then, you're in a dark alley and you're confronted by who you
1630480	1637200	suspect to be an armed and dangerous criminal who's on drugs. Now what would you do in that situation?
1637200	1644720	Well, Zimmerman claims he reached for his phone to dial 911. Now I don't buy this at all, you know,
1644720	1649200	excuse me Mr Dangerous Armed Criminal could you hold still for a few minutes while I call the
1649200	1655520	police on you right in front of you. No, that doesn't make any sense to me. What would make
1655520	1661040	sense to me in this situation is someone reaching for their gun. Now there's a few issues here.
1661040	1666800	Firstly, Florida is a concealed carry state and Zimmerman had a concealed carry permit.
1666800	1672720	Open carry is generally banned. Now if you're correct in your assessment of the person being
1672720	1677120	a dangerous armed criminal then of course you'd be in the right to reach for your gun to defend
1677120	1682640	yourself but if you later turned out to be wrong and your dangerous armed criminal turned out to
1682640	1689360	be an unarmed teenager walking home from the store then you're fucked because drawing, reaching for,
1689360	1694480	or flashing your gun would make you the aggressor and initiator of the physical confrontation and
1694480	1701040	then you're going to prison. So beyond my own estimation of what was the most likely series of
1701040	1707360	events, what evidence do I have that Zimmerman reached for his gun? Well, nothing that would
1707360	1713280	stand up in court admittedly but there is something else that leads me to believe that is what happened.
1713280	1718960	"...from but he was about where you were and I said I don't have a problem and I went to go grab
1718960	1724640	my cell phone but my I left it in a different pocket and I went I looked down in my hand pocket
1724640	1729360	and he said you got a problem now and then he was here and he punched me in the face."
1729360	1735840	So Zimmerman here indicates that he tried to find his phone to call 911 but he had moved his phone
1735840	1741040	to a different pocket and looks down to his right side to indicate that's where he reached for it
1741600	1746000	and this is significant because this is also the area of his body where his gun was.
1746560	1752720	"...but uh that's when my jacket moved up and I had my my firearm on my right side hit."
1753440	1758640	Now according to Zimmerman he had only just got off the phone with the non-emergency police line
1758640	1764160	so he had just put his phone away only a few moments ago according to his timeline
1764800	1770480	and now he suddenly can't remember where it is. So Zimmerman, when confronted by who he thinks
1770480	1776640	is a dangerous armed criminal in a dark alley, coincidentally reaches to check for his phone
1776640	1782800	in the right side pocket where his gun happens to be. I don't know, it is possible but it's
1782800	1788400	awfully convenient and now you might be thinking why would Zimmerman bother to lie about this?
1788400	1793920	He's the only living witness to the start of the fight so he can make up whatever story he likes
1793920	1799520	and the answer there is that Zimmerman at this point knew there was a witness to the incident
1799520	1804880	but didn't have any indication how much of the event they had actually been witnessed to.
1804880	1808880	From Zimmerman's interview with the police on the night of the shooting he says
1808880	1813760	Then somebody comes out and I couldn't see. There was a flashlight in my head so I asked if it was
1813760	1820160	a police officer and he said no it was a witness but he was calling the police and I said the
1820160	1826160	police are on their way. So present in Zimmerman's mind during the police walkthrough is the existence
1826160	1832640	of a witness who could have possibly seen any part of the event which means he needs to account for
1832640	1838640	his actions including that of reaching for his gun. So that's why his phone goes missing only
1838640	1844000	seconds after he put it away and why he not so coincidentally reaches to that area of his body
1844560	1849840	right before Martin hits him. So actually Zimmerman faced with what he incorrectly
1849840	1855040	thought was a dangerous criminal reached for his gun and Trayvon Martin chased down an alley by
1855040	1863360	a stranger who then reached for his gun defended himself. Is that what happened? Well probably we
1863360	1869840	can't know for sure. There was actually no witness to the start of the fight no CCTV footage and that
1869840	1877040	series of events while likely wouldn't stand up in court. I haven't proved anything there and that's
1877040	1881920	because it's impossible to prove. Zimmerman should never have been charged with something that it was
1881920	1886720	impossible to prove in court and I'd like to highlight something here in conclusion to this
1886720	1891920	section. I just talked about the Trayvon Martin case without once descending into the ridiculous
1891920	1897840	character assassinations that were rampant in the American media during the trial. Trayvon Martin
1897840	1903760	smoked weed you know the drug that notoriously makes people really angry and confrontational.
1903760	1909200	Trayvon Martin posted a photograph of a gun on social media that's apparently more of an
1909200	1914400	indication of violent tendencies than owning carrying and actually shooting someone with a gun.
1914960	1919920	Now this is the other tactic for justifying Zimmerman's actions saying Trayvon was obviously
1919920	1927360	a bad guy since he did x or y common teenage activity and that's just disgusting and shameful
1927360	1932960	behavior to be honest. Until the legal punishment for skipping school or smoking weed or whatever
1932960	1938960	is the death penalty people can stuff those sorts of justifications right up their back holes.
1939520	1944880	So anyway what I hope I have proved during that little analysis of the Trayvon Martin case
1944880	1951200	is that there is no avenue whatsoever for laying blame upon Trayvon Martin and again in summary
1951200	1955600	any injury Zimmerman sustained could have been perfectly legally inflicted. Unless you have
1955600	1961040	evidence that Trayvon Martin started the fight Zimmerman's injuries are no justification.
1961040	1966240	Trayvon Martin still being between the houses and not returning home is also no justification.
1966240	1970880	Zimmerman also had no reason to be there and even if Martin did confront Zimmerman
1970880	1976400	that doesn't prove who initiated the physical confrontation which is the important thing.
1976400	1981200	There is nothing you can accuse Martin of that is not also true of Zimmerman and so the most
1981200	1986880	pro-Zimmerman position I will accept as legitimate here is one of complete neutrality. The only
1986880	1991760	logical explanation I have for explaining why people would actually openly justify Zimmerman's
1991760	1997600	actions is because they are racially biased whether consciously or not. Absolutely none of
1997600	2002560	the evidence implicates Martin as doing anything illegal at any point other than the testimony of
2002560	2008320	a man who has an enormous incentive to lie and thus whose account cannot be trusted. If you
2008320	2015200	favor Zimmerman's account of the incident you are by process of elimination either a fool or racially
2015200	2020880	biased. Now I stated earlier that I could prove that a racial bias exists in the response to
2020880	2026400	cases like this and so let's take a look at that and for this last section of the video we need to
2026400	2034880	know about the shooting of Lavoie Finicum. So on January 2nd 2016 an armed group led by Ammon Bundy
2034880	2042320	of the 2014 Bundy standoff seized and occupied the National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County in
2042320	2050800	Oregon. They did this for some stupid reason whatever it doesn't matter. On January 26th
2050800	2056320	two trucks carrying Ammon Bundy, Lavoie Finicum and others left the refuge to travel to a meeting
2056320	2062480	in an adjacent county and the FBI used this opportunity to intercept the trucks and arrest
2062480	2068480	the group. One truck stopped but the other of which Lavoie Finicum was the driver led the
2068480	2074080	police on a high-speed chase with Lavoie Finicum shouting that the only way the police could stop
2074080	2079680	him was to shoot him. A mile down the road Finicum's truck encountered an FBI roadblock
2079680	2084560	where he crashed left the truck armed with a gun and approached police who fatally shot him.
2085440	2090400	Now whatever you think about the legitimacy of the police shooting of Lavoie Finicum the facts
2090400	2095120	are that he was involved in an armed takeover and occupation of a government building led the
2095120	2099840	police on a high-speed chase told the police he wouldn't stop until he was killed and crashed
2099840	2103840	his car at a police roadblock and then approached them armed with a gun and it really is amazing
2103840	2108960	what you have to do to get the police to shoot you if you're an older white guy in a cowboy hat
2108960	2113440	and all of this was recorded by both a police helicopter and camera footage from inside the
2113440	2118320	truck and I want to make clear here that I'm not celebrating or laughing about the man's death in
2118320	2124800	any way but it was entirely avoidable by him. For the other truck that stopped when the police asked
2124800	2131440	all occupants were arrested peacefully. Lavoie Finicum did not have to die and it was clearly
2131440	2137360	his own actions that brought about his shooting. So why am I telling you about this incident? Well
2137360	2143200	it serves as a very useful comparison to the shootings of various young black men including
2143200	2149040	Trayvon Martin because thanks to the permanent record of the internet it means that I get to do
2149040	2156000	this. Keith Roadbush on twitter says Finicum was simply murdered by scared cops who don't know how
2156000	2162240	to handle it when someone else is armed and trained. Finicum never hurt anyone. For Trayvon
2162240	2166960	Martin however, Keith says my solemn prayer is that Trayvon will serve to teach young black
2166960	2173280	Americans the thug-like gang-banging stealing and dope-smoking life is futile. Holly Ammon on
2173280	2179600	twitter says an innocent man was gunned. Lavoie Finicum did nothing wrong. These men, all of them,
2179600	2184640	did nothing wrong. Yeah other than occupy a federal building and lead the police on high
2184640	2191280	speed chase, Holly. For Trayvon Martin however, Holly says Trayvon was just a big black thug.
2191280	2196800	BlueVino on twitter says it's kind of rude to forget that Lavoie Finicum was shot and killed
2196800	2202640	while unarmed. In actuality it's kind of rude to forget that he was really armed with a gun.
2202880	2209920	BlueVino. Anyway for Trayvon Martin, BlueVino says the death was Trayvon's fault for attacking.
2209920	2217280	Trayvon had no right to attack. Trayvon initiated violence. Waifu Kaori says one confirmed dead
2217280	2224160	Lavoie Finicum hold these people accountable. Should we also hold George Zimmerman accountable
2224160	2230640	though? Apparently not. The hero George Zimmerman is going to donate money from his gun auction to
2230640	2237360	fight the Black Lives Matter terrorists. What a great man. Ginger Merritt on twitter says
2237360	2243520	Lavoie Finicum was murdered in cold blood and then quotes a bible passage. For Trayvon Martin
2243520	2249520	however, she says God protected someone Trayvon Martin would have assaulted. So God works in
2249520	2256400	mysterious and apparently racially biased ways it seems. D. Claire Diane claims Lavoie Finicum
2256400	2262960	was murdered in the first degree but elsewhere states Trayvon Martin was a black thug. And it
2262960	2268720	goes on, you get the point. And you can compare the shooting of the armed Lavoie Finicum to other
2268720	2276880	shootings of unarmed black people as it turns out. At Radical RW on twitter says Lavoie Finicum was
2276880	2282640	murdered in the first degree but for the case of Tamia Rice, the 12 year old shot by police while
2282640	2289280	playing in a park, they say some idiot pulled a fake gun on a cop and got shot. What did he
2289280	2294800	think would happen? Radical RW doesn't bother asking what Lavoie Finicum thought would happen
2294800	2300640	when he ran a police roadblock however. There can be no explanation for this obvious contradiction
2300640	2307360	in reactions except for racial bias. When an armed white criminal is considered less dangerous than
2307360	2314720	an unarmed black teenager, what other explanation could there possibly be? So don't be like these
2314720	2321040	people I guess is my point. Don't go for the easy excuse. Put some thought into your opinions and
2321040	2328480	also consider why you hold those opinions that you do. Now I intentionally called George Zimmerman
2328480	2335120	white in the first minute of this video and I did that for a reason. One point that was repeated
2335120	2341120	constantly during the trial was that Zimmerman was not white, he's hispanic and therefore this
2341120	2347680	isn't a white black race thing you know. Which is pretty racist in itself to be honest but I called
2347680	2353520	Zimmerman white because that is what he himself identifies as. He says he's white in the police
2353520	2359200	interviews because of course hispanic isn't a skin color. You can have white hispanic people and
2359200	2365280	black hispanic people and whatever else. Claiming Zimmerman to be hispanic not white portrays an
2365280	2371280	ignorance both of the facts of the case and of the relevant racial terminology. So I called
2371280	2377440	Zimmerman white early on deliberately to trip up any youtube commenters who don't listen to
2377440	2383600	arguments and don't watch the whole video. So anyone who comments Zimmerman was actually hispanic
2383600	2389360	haha you're wrong beneath this video I'm here preemptively shaming you. Thanks a lot for
2389360	2395920	watching everyone. Another day, another depressing video. I apologize. I have one about the British
2395920	2402320	Empire in the works. I'm sure that's not going to be too cheery either. Maybe eventually I'll run out
2402320	2407120	of darker topics and we can talk about something pleasant for a change. Wouldn't that be nice?
2407760	2412800	Thanks as always to all my patrons scrolling by right now who enable me to keep making videos
2412800	2418480	like this one so if you want more videos like this consider sending me a dolly yourself and
2418480	2423920	also maybe check out the other creators that I personally support on patreon all of whom are
2423920	2430880	very interesting folks who create awesome things and are definitely worth having a p-cat also also
2430880	2435600	follow me on twitter and send me a curious cat question if you like I try to answer at least
2435600	2439680	some of them rightio thanks folks I'll see you soon
