00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Hello, everyone. So, today I'm gonna talk about the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman.

00:06.240 --> 00:11.440
But I feel like I need to explain myself and justify this a little before we get going here.

00:11.440 --> 00:17.120
It'd be fair to ask, why now, five years later, do you wanna talk about this?

00:17.120 --> 00:20.480
And the answer there is that I still believe it to be relevant.

00:20.480 --> 00:25.360
The generalities of the incident, a black person, in this case Trayvon Martin,

00:25.360 --> 00:29.120
is killed by a white person, in this case George Zimmerman,

00:29.360 --> 00:32.720
in unclear or ambiguous circumstances.

00:32.720 --> 00:38.160
And then later, the killer receives either no or relatively little legal punishment.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.800
The names and the locations change, but the general outline remains the same.

00:43.600 --> 00:48.640
And the feeling held by a lot of black people and more racially conscious people of other races

00:48.640 --> 00:53.120
is that these people probably would not have been killed had they been white,

00:53.120 --> 00:55.200
or if they had still been killed,

00:55.200 --> 00:58.880
the justice system would have treated the killers much less leniently.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.280
And this can be a hard thing to prove.

01:01.280 --> 01:04.560
We're talking about certain likelihoods and probabilities,

01:05.280 --> 01:08.000
subconscious or otherwise hidden biases,

01:08.000 --> 01:12.800
and we don't have another America in which Trayvon Martin was a white teenager

01:12.800 --> 01:17.280
walking home from the store to see what would have happened differently were that the case.

01:17.840 --> 01:23.120
It's also easy to examine only the particulars of each incident in isolation,

01:23.120 --> 01:25.840
and therefore avoid considering the overall trends.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.240
Each case is easy to excuse if you're looking for excuses.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.920
Trayvon Martin hit George Zimmerman, so Zimmerman was justified in defending himself.

01:35.920 --> 01:40.880
Tamir Rice had a toy gun, and you know, that could have been mistaken for a real gun,

01:40.880 --> 01:43.600
so, you know, therefore, etc.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.000
There's always an excuse, however valid that excuse is,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.200
with the cases that receive a lot of media attention.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.040
A useful comparison here is the shooting of Levar Edward Jones.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.480
Now, this shooting was not a particularly high-profile case.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.720
A Google search for Levar Edward Jones only gives 1300 results,

02:02.720 --> 02:07.200
compared to the 1.6 million for Trayvon Martin, for instance,

02:07.200 --> 02:10.880
and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people hadn't heard of this shooting.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.040
So, a very brief overview then.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.000
On September the 4th of 2014,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.880
South Carolina State Trooper Sean Grubert pulled up behind Levar Edward Jones

02:20.880 --> 02:23.120
as he accessed his vehicle at a gas station.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.880
Grubert asked Jones to get his license and registration,

02:26.880 --> 02:28.480
and when Jones reached for them,

02:28.480 --> 02:32.320
Grubert panicked and pulled his gun and fired several times,

02:32.320 --> 02:34.000
hitting Jones in the hip.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.600
Now, I'll link the video in the description and avoid showing it here,

02:37.600 --> 02:39.600
but it's pretty much as I described.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.920
So why didn't this case get as much media attention as some others?

02:43.920 --> 02:45.760
Well, there's a few factors,

02:45.760 --> 02:48.960
and they're all rather depressing to think about, to be honest.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.880
The first is that there is a clear record of the incident.

02:52.880 --> 02:56.400
It happened in plain sight in view of Grubert's dashcam.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.000
The second is that the person who was shot survived

03:00.000 --> 03:02.240
and could thus later argue their case.

03:02.880 --> 03:06.000
And the third is that Grubert was very quickly fired,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.040
arrested, and charged with felony assault and battery.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.000
So there's very little to argue about this case.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.440
It's clear-cut.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.240
The person who was shot was entirely innocent,

03:16.240 --> 03:18.880
the police officer was clearly in the wrong,

03:18.880 --> 03:20.080
and that's the end of that.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.480
You know, there's no excuse for that one.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.320
And that's the important thing here,

03:24.320 --> 03:27.120
there not being an excuse or a justification.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.480
But let's imagine an alternate version of the shooting of Levar Edward Jones.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.200
What if the gunshot had been fatal

03:35.200 --> 03:38.960
and the person who was shot wasn't around to tell his side of the story?

03:39.600 --> 03:42.640
And what if the dashcam had been angled slightly differently

03:42.640 --> 03:44.400
or didn't pick up the incident?

03:44.400 --> 03:49.760
Or, alternatively, what if the dashcam footage had been not so mysteriously lost?

03:50.400 --> 03:53.120
Uh, well then the officer in this imaginary case

03:53.120 --> 03:57.040
could have then said anything he liked to justify the shooting.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.240
He looked dangerous, he said he was gonna kill me,

04:00.240 --> 04:04.720
he grabbed for my gun, whatever, and there's the justification.

04:04.720 --> 04:09.840
Now we see that blame is always individualized in these sorts of incidents.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.840
The black person who was shot or killed is always considered at fault

04:13.840 --> 04:18.400
up until it's an obvious and unavoidable fact that they were innocent.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.160
Now, completely absent from this framework are societal factors

04:22.160 --> 04:26.400
or racial biases or any sort of wider consideration of trends.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.600
Only one person can be at fault.

04:29.600 --> 04:33.520
It's either the person who was shot or the person who did the shooting,

04:33.520 --> 04:35.280
and that's the end of that.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.840
And so we come to the point of my video.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.840
This video is aimed at people who might subconsciously even

04:41.840 --> 04:46.000
reach for the easy excuse to justify these kinds of incidents.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.880
Now, I don't think these people are capital R racists necessarily,

04:50.880 --> 04:54.480
just that they might be harboring some biases that can be exposed

04:54.480 --> 04:58.880
with a little effort and a bit of deeper thinking about the topic.

04:58.880 --> 05:03.760
And we're gonna examine one case in particular, the shooting of Trayvon Martin.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.680
We're gonna look at the various justifications given for Zimmerman's actions

05:07.680 --> 05:12.640
and see if they hold water, and then afterwards I've come up with a clever way,

05:12.640 --> 05:18.640
if I do say so myself, of proving that bias exists in reactions to cases like this.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.480
So stick about if you want to see that.

05:21.360 --> 05:25.920
My intention here is that by getting people to stop and think about just one case,

05:25.920 --> 05:29.360
they might not be so quick to jump to conclusions for similar cases.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.120
My hope is that this video can be linked to people who might try

05:33.120 --> 05:35.840
to excuse the actions of George Zimmerman,

05:35.840 --> 05:39.760
and hopefully they'll sit through it and maybe take a few points on board.

05:39.760 --> 05:45.200
So okay, I'll start out here by giving an as-neutral-as-possible account of the incident.

05:45.840 --> 05:50.320
On February 26th, 2012, Trayvon Martin,

05:50.320 --> 05:54.720
who was visiting family at the Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Florida,

05:55.280 --> 05:58.320
walked to a local store at about 7 p.m.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.080
On his return from the store, he was spotted by George Zimmerman,

06:02.080 --> 06:04.480
the organizer of the local neighborhood watch,

06:04.480 --> 06:07.440
who mistook him for a criminal and called the police.

06:08.160 --> 06:12.960
Zimmerman described Martin as looking as if he was up to no good and possibly on drugs.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.600
After observing Martin for a time,

06:15.600 --> 06:19.600
Zimmerman left his vehicle to continue to follow him when he moved out of sight.

06:20.240 --> 06:24.560
This was followed by the police dispatcher asking Zimmerman if he was following Martin,

06:24.560 --> 06:26.880
to which Zimmerman replied that he was.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.920
The dispatcher then asked him not to do that.

06:30.560 --> 06:36.560
Zimmerman was also armed with a 9mm handgun for which he had a concealed carry permit.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.040
After being unable to locate Martin,

06:39.040 --> 06:42.160
Zimmerman entered his call with the police dispatcher,

06:42.160 --> 06:45.600
instructing them to call him back when an officer arrived on the scene.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.080
Shortly after ending the call,

06:48.080 --> 06:53.360
Zimmerman and Martin met at the top of the T-shaped intersection between the rows of houses.

06:53.920 --> 06:58.400
A physical altercation ensued during which Zimmerman received a nosebleed

06:58.400 --> 07:01.120
and some light abrasive wounds to the back of his head,

07:01.120 --> 07:03.840
and Trayvon Martin was shot fatally in the chest.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.520
Police arrived on the scene shortly thereafter.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.920
So that's the basic outline of the events,

07:09.920 --> 07:12.800
containing only the facts that are beyond dispute.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.480
Of course, quite a few other things happened, or probably happened,

07:16.480 --> 07:19.120
but those need to be talked about in more detail.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.440
So what do we think about this incident?

07:21.440 --> 07:26.800
Well, let me start by saying that I agree with Zimmerman being found not guilty at trial.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.400
Now, that is not because I do not believe him to be at fault.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.280
Because he was.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.040
He definitely was.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.920
But I believe he was overcharged.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.880
Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder,

07:38.880 --> 07:42.640
which requires the prosecution to prove beyond the reasonable doubt

07:42.640 --> 07:46.000
that Zimmerman intended to kill Trayvon Martin.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.480
And without an eyewitness to the start of the physical altercation, as we'll see,

07:50.480 --> 07:52.960
that is impossible to prove in court.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.560
The start of the altercation is what is important here.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.400
You see, the first justification for the shooting of Trayvon Martin

08:00.400 --> 08:02.160
is that he injured Zimmerman,

08:02.160 --> 08:05.440
and therefore Zimmerman could have reasonably feared for his life,

08:05.440 --> 08:07.600
and thus was in the clear to defend himself.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.560
Now, the problem with this argument is that

08:10.560 --> 08:14.960
that same justification for Zimmerman's actions also works in reverse.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.600
Trayvon Martin was also injured.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.040
Much worse than Zimmerman, he was fatally injured,

08:21.040 --> 08:22.960
and therefore, by the same logic,

08:22.960 --> 08:27.840
he was legally in the clear to kill Zimmerman in self-defense as well.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.560
So we're in a weird legal limbo here.

08:30.560 --> 08:35.360
It certainly can't be the case that two people are just legally allowed to fight to the death

08:35.360 --> 08:37.520
because they both fear for their own lives.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.240
So what matters here is who initiated the physical altercation.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.240
Without knowing that, Zimmerman's injuries could have been inflicted

08:46.240 --> 08:49.760
by Trayvon Martin acting legally in self-defense.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.160
And a lot of people who were outraged by this case

08:52.160 --> 08:54.320
probably fought with some justification

08:54.320 --> 08:58.160
that a stranger following you at night and chasing you down a dark alley

08:58.160 --> 09:01.360
was itself enough to justify defending yourself physically.

09:02.160 --> 09:07.600
As for actual hard courtroom evidence, though, we have relatively little to go on.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.920
We have Zimmerman's account of the incident,

09:09.920 --> 09:12.960
told through his written statement, his interviews with the police,

09:12.960 --> 09:16.400
and a recorded walkthrough of the event conducted the following day.

09:16.400 --> 09:22.000
But that is obviously not reliable by itself for what I hope are obvious reasons.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.760
Also, Zimmerman provably lies at several times

09:25.760 --> 09:29.760
during his recounting of the incident, which we'll get to shortly.

09:29.760 --> 09:34.080
So without a witness to or recording of Zimmerman starting the fight,

09:34.080 --> 09:38.560
and with no other indication that Zimmerman actually wanted to kill Martin,

09:38.560 --> 09:41.680
there isn't really enough here for a murder conviction.

09:41.680 --> 09:45.680
What you can prove is that Zimmerman was in the wrong at several points.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.360
He was incorrect in his profiling of Martin as a criminal.

09:49.360 --> 09:52.720
He was incorrect to leave his vehicle to pursue Martin.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.560
He had several times acted recklessly and idiotically,

09:56.560 --> 10:01.280
but that doesn't prove he actually wanted to murder Trayvon Martin.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.240
And indeed, if we read the Sanford Police Department's report

10:04.240 --> 10:08.560
after they eventually decided to recommend charging Zimmerman with something,

10:08.560 --> 10:12.720
they said there is probable cause for charging Zimmerman with manslaughter,

10:12.720 --> 10:13.520
stating,

10:13.520 --> 10:16.560
"...the encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin

10:16.560 --> 10:18.960
was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman.

10:18.960 --> 10:23.040
If he had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement,

10:23.040 --> 10:27.040
or conversely, if he'd identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen

10:27.040 --> 10:30.720
and initiated dialogue in an effort to dispel each party's concerns,

10:31.600 --> 10:35.840
there is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity

10:35.840 --> 10:37.280
at the time of the encounter."

10:37.280 --> 10:42.560
And yes, the prosecutors would have had a much easier time proving manslaughter in court,

10:42.560 --> 10:47.200
mainly because of all the aforementioned lies that Zimmerman can be shown to have told.

10:47.200 --> 10:53.200
So, let's talk about some of those and also examine another anti-Treyvon Martin argument,

10:53.200 --> 10:56.800
this one being that during the time Zimmerman was on the phone,

10:56.800 --> 11:00.720
Trayvon Martin had enough time to get home to safety.

11:00.720 --> 11:06.480
And people generally use this fact to suggest that since Trayvon Martin did not return home immediately,

11:06.480 --> 11:10.880
he was therefore looking to ambush or otherwise confront Zimmerman.

11:10.880 --> 11:14.000
Now, one can come up with several possible scenarios

11:14.000 --> 11:17.600
for why Martin did not return home immediately.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.240
Firstly, he was on the phone to a friend at the time,

11:20.240 --> 11:24.400
so maybe he simply wanted to finish his conversation before reaching the house,

11:24.400 --> 11:26.240
and so he paused early.

11:26.240 --> 11:31.200
Secondly, maybe he was sufficiently freaked out by the strange guy who was following him around

11:31.200 --> 11:34.880
and decided that leading that person to his house might be a bad idea.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.920
Remember, Martin had no clue who Zimmerman was or why he was following him,

11:39.920 --> 11:42.560
so that is another possible scenario.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.480
These possibilities, though, are actually entirely unnecessary.

11:47.360 --> 11:52.480
Let's go with the idea that Trayvon Martin did hide or even walked all the way home

11:52.480 --> 11:56.800
before changing his mind and deciding he was gonna confront Zimmerman.

11:56.800 --> 12:01.120
So he marched right back up the path with the intention of doing just that.

12:01.120 --> 12:05.920
Now, the problem here is that confront does not mean attack,

12:05.920 --> 12:08.000
and it certainly does not mean kill.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.520
Martin does not know what's going on, remember.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.680
He doesn't know that the police have been called,

12:13.680 --> 12:17.440
or that Zimmerman has a gun, or that he's about to be shot with it.

12:17.440 --> 12:21.360
He's under no legal responsibility to do anything in particular,

12:21.360 --> 12:23.120
so long as he does not break the law.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.760
He does not have to return home.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.560
He can walk up and down the street all night if he likes,

12:28.560 --> 12:33.360
and there's nothing illegal about approaching someone to ask why they're following you.

12:33.360 --> 12:38.800
Criticizing Martin for not returning home immediately is cynically placing the blame on him

12:38.800 --> 12:41.920
for not anticipating and avoiding his own killing.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.840
Even if Martin did double back to confront Zimmerman,

12:45.840 --> 12:50.560
that still tells us nothing about who initiated the physical confrontation.

12:50.560 --> 12:55.280
Secondly here, this criticism of Martin's actions also applies equally,

12:55.280 --> 12:57.360
or even more so, to Zimmerman.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.480
The top of the T intersection is much closer to where Zimmerman's truck was parked

13:02.480 --> 13:04.800
than where Trayvon Martin's house was,

13:04.800 --> 13:08.480
and Zimmerman had the exact same amount of time to get back to his truck

13:08.480 --> 13:10.160
if that's what he wished to do.

13:10.880 --> 13:15.680
If you're going to criticize Trayvon Martin for still being present when Zimmerman got off the phone,

13:15.680 --> 13:19.360
then you have to apply that criticism to Zimmerman also.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.360
Unlike Martin, however, Zimmerman is still around to inform us

13:23.360 --> 13:27.520
why he was still in the alley between the houses instead of back at his truck,

13:27.520 --> 13:32.640
and his explanation for still being there, as it turns out, makes no sense whatsoever.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.720
Firstly, let's go through the transcript of Zimmerman's call to the police

13:36.720 --> 13:39.040
and highlight all the relevant information.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.400
Then we'll look at Zimmerman's walkthrough of the events the next day

13:42.400 --> 13:44.160
and compare the two accounts.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.440
So, the relevant parts of the police call are as follows.

13:47.440 --> 13:52.320
Firstly, Zimmerman gives the dispatcher the address of the clubhouse at Retreat View Circle.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.720
Then later in the call, he gives the more precise location of his truck.

13:56.720 --> 14:01.040
Go straight past the clubhouse, make a left, and then past the mailboxes.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.400
That's where his truck was.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.800
Then the dispatcher asks what address Zimmerman is parked in front of,

14:07.440 --> 14:11.280
one time, and Zimmerman responds that he does not know.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.960
And at the end of the call, the following exchange takes place.

14:14.960 --> 14:19.360
The dispatcher asks Zimmerman if he wants to meet the police near the mailboxes

14:19.360 --> 14:22.960
where his truck is, and Zimmerman agrees at first.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.880
But then when the dispatcher attempts to confirm this meeting place,

14:27.440 --> 14:29.520
Zimmerman changes his mind and says,

14:29.600 --> 14:42.160
Now let's look at the recording of Zimmerman's reenactment to the incident for the police,

14:42.160 --> 14:45.360
because there are a few key points where his account differs here.

14:59.520 --> 15:18.640
At this interaction, where the dispatcher asks Zimmerman if he can get to somewhere

15:18.640 --> 15:22.400
he can see Trayvon Martin is not in the transcript,

15:22.400 --> 15:28.800
and is likely a later embellishment by Zimmerman to justify his continued following of Martin in his truck.

15:30.000 --> 15:40.480
I saw him walking back that way and then cut through the back of the houses.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.240
He looked back and he noticed me and he cut back through the houses.

15:44.240 --> 15:51.200
I was still on the phone with non-emergency and then he came back and he started walking

15:51.200 --> 15:56.560
up towards the grass and then came down and circled my car and I told the operator that

15:56.560 --> 16:02.400
he was circling my car. I didn't hear if he said anything, but he had his hand in his waistband.

16:02.400 --> 16:07.520
At this interaction, where Zimmerman observes Martin circle his truck and informs the operator

16:07.520 --> 16:12.640
about it, is not present in the transcript. Zimmerman does mention that Martin is looking

16:12.640 --> 16:17.440
at him at one point, but at no point mentions Martin circle the truck.

16:17.440 --> 16:22.240
It's unlikely that Martin would have had enough time to do this in the brief time in the call

16:22.240 --> 16:28.800
before Zimmerman left his truck, and also unlikely Zimmerman would not have mentioned it to the dispatcher.

16:28.800 --> 16:33.760
This is likely a later embellishment in order to make Martin appear more threatening.

16:33.760 --> 16:38.960
And I think I told the operator that and they said where are you?

16:38.960 --> 16:43.760
And I could not remember the name of the street because I don't live on this street.

16:43.760 --> 16:50.400
Retreat view circle goes in a circle. And I said I don't know and he goes we need an address.

16:50.400 --> 16:57.440
And I said I don't know an address. I think I gave them my address. And they said give us

16:57.440 --> 17:02.800
directions to get to you. And I said if you tell the police to go straight at the clubhouse and

17:02.800 --> 17:07.440
make a left my truck will be there. And again they asked me where he went and what direction he went.

17:07.440 --> 17:12.720
And I said I don't know. And then I thought to get out and look for a street sign.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.720
So I got out of my car and I started walking.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.720
Go ahead.

17:33.840 --> 17:37.920
I was still on the phone with non-emergency and I started walking.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.920
Okay.

17:39.920 --> 17:49.360
And because I didn't see a street sign here but I knew if I went straight through that that's retreat view circle.

17:49.360 --> 17:54.160
And I can give him an address. He said just give me the address of the house you're in front of.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.160
And there's no address because this is the back of the house.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
So it works here.

18:01.200 --> 18:05.840
At firstly the dispatcher does not repeatedly ask for an address in the transcript.

18:05.840 --> 18:10.800
This is a fabrication by Zimmerman in order to create a pretext for him to leave the car.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.120
Secondly his described actions here make no sense.

18:15.120 --> 18:20.000
I mean we're first expected to believe that a man who has lived in the neighborhood for several years

18:20.000 --> 18:25.600
and is the self-appointed head of the neighborhood watch can't remember what street he's on in a

18:25.600 --> 18:32.080
neighborhood with free streets. That seems rather unlikely to me but whatever.

18:32.080 --> 18:37.600
Next up Zimmerman is parked on Twin Trees Lane and claims he can't give an address because he's

18:37.600 --> 18:44.320
at the back of the houses. But as he's saying this we can see behind him some houses which do face

18:44.320 --> 18:49.440
onto Twin Trees Lane. So his claim that he has to walk through to retreat view circle in order to

18:49.440 --> 18:54.880
find an address is clearly incorrect. He could just look at the much closer houses that do

18:54.880 --> 19:01.040
actually face onto Twin Trees Lane. So that's when I walked straight through here to get the address

19:01.040 --> 19:07.120
so that I could meet the police officer and then they said uh I said he's not here they said do

19:07.120 --> 19:11.440
you still want him to come and I said yes and they said where do you want him to come to and I said

19:11.440 --> 19:16.720
you know what just tell him to meet me at my truck next to the clubhouse if you go straight

19:16.720 --> 19:20.560
in through the clubhouse it makes a left I have a Honda original I'm silver Honda original I was

19:20.560 --> 19:26.400
parked right there I'll meet him right there so I started walking back. This interaction in which

19:26.480 --> 19:31.600
Zimmerman informs the dispatcher that he wants to meet the police by his truck is the actual

19:31.600 --> 19:36.880
opposite of what appears in the transcript. The dispatcher is the one to suggest that and

19:36.880 --> 19:43.280
Zimmerman instead proposes them calling him back to see where he is. This lie is also repeated in

19:43.280 --> 19:47.360
one of the police interviews where Zimmerman claims the dispatcher asked where he wanted

19:47.360 --> 19:54.560
to meet the police and he said at his car. So what does all this add up to? Well I think it's fairly

19:54.560 --> 20:01.440
clear that all this rubbish about needing to find an address is an obvious fabrication. The dispatcher

20:01.440 --> 20:06.960
already had an address they were directing police to and at no point asked Zimmerman to go walking

20:06.960 --> 20:12.800
to find another one and even if they had done that there were much closer addresses available for

20:12.800 --> 20:18.080
Zimmerman to go and check and even if Zimmerman had needed to walk through to retreat view circle

20:18.800 --> 20:24.080
he lived on retreat view circle and I simply refused to believe that he forgot the name of his

20:24.080 --> 20:28.880
own street and needed to go and physically look at a street sign to see where he was.

20:28.880 --> 20:34.800
Now the probable truth is simply that Zimmerman was still looking for Trayvon Martin intending to

20:34.800 --> 20:42.400
be the hero and catch the bad guy because quote these assholes always get away. Now Zimmerman also

20:42.400 --> 20:47.520
tells several lies relating to the initial confrontation between him and Martin and let's

20:47.520 --> 20:53.680
take a look at those. Firstly there is a major discrepancy in Zimmerman's story about the location

20:53.680 --> 20:59.440
where he was knocked down by Martin. From his written statement he says as I headed back to

20:59.440 --> 21:07.680
my vehicle the suspect emerged from the darkness and said you got a problem I said no the suspect

21:07.680 --> 21:15.360
said you do now as I looked and tried to find my phone to dial 911 the suspect punched me in the

21:15.360 --> 21:22.560
face I fell backwards onto my back the suspect got on top of me. So Zimmerman here makes it sound as

21:22.560 --> 21:26.960
if he was immediately dropped by the first punch and this is echoed in his interview with the

21:26.960 --> 21:33.360
police he punched me in the nose at that point I fell down were you still standing at this point

21:34.080 --> 21:41.280
no ma'am okay I fell to the ground when he punched me the first time. So that's Zimmerman

21:41.280 --> 21:47.280
restating and confirming that he fell at the first hit and here's why this makes no sense

21:47.280 --> 21:52.880
if Zimmerman really was walking back to his truck from retreat view circle where he was apparently

21:52.880 --> 21:56.080
looking for a street sign to tell him what the name of the street he lived on was called

21:56.640 --> 22:02.080
and if he was doing that he would only need to walk across the top of the t intersection to get

22:02.080 --> 22:06.720
back to the truck. Now the problem with this account is that Martin's body was found a few

22:06.720 --> 22:12.400
houses down the path between the buildings here's a photograph taken from around the location where

22:12.400 --> 22:18.240
Zimmerman first claimed he fell to the ground showing Martin's body in the distance. So what

22:18.240 --> 22:23.840
does this mean? Well either Zimmerman's story about meeting Trayvon at the top of the intersection

22:23.840 --> 22:28.160
is untrue and he was actually punched to the ground 40 feet down the path between the buildings

22:28.160 --> 22:33.840
with no explanation of why he should be there or his story about being dropped with the first punch

22:33.840 --> 22:38.320
is untrue because if he'd fell to the ground at the top of the intersection then Trayvon Martin's

22:38.320 --> 22:44.080
body being found a few houses down the path makes no sense and let's watch Zimmerman realize in

22:44.080 --> 22:50.240
real time that this aspect of his story is a load of old crap. He was about there but he was walking

22:50.240 --> 22:58.480
towards me. Yes sir I believe like I said I was already past that so I didn't see exactly where

22:58.480 --> 23:04.640
he came from but he was about where you were and I said I don't have a problem and I went to go grab

23:04.640 --> 23:10.320
my cell phone but my I left it in a different pocket and I went I looked down in my hand pocket

23:10.320 --> 23:15.760
and he said you got a problem now and then he was here and he punched me in the face right here

23:16.560 --> 23:24.960
right around here okay to be honest I don't remember exactly that's why I think I stumbled

23:26.240 --> 23:31.840
and I fell down he pushed me down somehow he got on top of me on the grass or on the snow

23:32.800 --> 23:39.760
it was over more over towards here I think I was trying to push him away from me and then

23:41.120 --> 23:45.600
he got on top of me somewhere around here and

23:50.560 --> 23:55.840
Now all of this trying to push him away from me while moving down the path stuff is completely

23:55.840 --> 24:01.280
absent from any of Zimmerman's earlier accounts of the incident and is also a bit suspect by

24:01.280 --> 24:07.280
itself. If Zimmerman was trying to escape why didn't he go to the lit street where his truck

24:07.280 --> 24:13.760
was? You know why instead move further down the dark path towards Trayvon Martin's house

24:13.760 --> 24:19.840
incidentally? I don't know. It's a possibility obviously but the fact that Zimmerman neglected

24:19.840 --> 24:23.680
to mention this in his written statement and police interviews and made it sound as though

24:23.680 --> 24:29.520
he was knocked down immediately makes me doubt his story here. Zimmerman also undersells the

24:29.520 --> 24:35.760
distance down the path that he fell to the ground. He moves to about the location of this tree but

24:35.760 --> 24:40.320
we can see from the image that Martin's body was actually found about another house length past the

24:40.320 --> 24:45.680
tree. Now okay it was dark and a traumatic experience so I can't expect Zimmerman to be

24:45.680 --> 24:50.480
that accurate but it is still worth pointing out that Zimmerman's account in this recorded

24:50.480 --> 24:55.520
walkthrough contradicts both his previous statements and the crime scene photographs.

24:56.080 --> 25:03.440
So why would Zimmerman lie here? He asked with mock sincerity. Well obviously because he's trying

25:03.440 --> 25:08.800
to give himself the best possible justification for his actions. Zimmerman's account includes

25:08.800 --> 25:14.320
Martin being the first aggressor which is very important but also Martin explicitly telling

25:14.320 --> 25:20.000
Zimmerman that he was going to kill him and then reaching for Zimmerman's gun and I mean why not

25:20.000 --> 25:24.640
right? If you're the only witness to a shooting you committed you may as well make it airtight.

25:24.640 --> 25:30.320
I'm surprised you didn't have Trayvon Martin say, I Trayvon Martin hereby pledge to kill you and

25:30.320 --> 25:35.440
will do so shortly. This therefore gives you the full legal justification to respond with lethal

25:35.440 --> 25:40.400
force and defense of your own life. I mean you know why not? Now the idea that Trayvon Martin

25:40.400 --> 25:46.080
would at first run away from Zimmerman and then see red and decide to double back and actually

25:46.080 --> 25:51.520
murder him strains belief somewhat. I mean I don't believe Zimmerman chased down Martin

25:51.520 --> 25:57.440
intending to kill him in some racist rage but nor do I believe that Trayvon Martin while he was

25:57.440 --> 26:03.120
still on the phone to a friend mind silently decided to double back and murder Zimmerman.

26:03.120 --> 26:09.120
So what do we think actually happened? Well we're admittedly moving into the realm of speculation

26:09.120 --> 26:14.320
here. I do have a theory of what was probably the most likely version of events and I'll give that

26:14.320 --> 26:19.760
here for whatever good it's worth. So Zimmerman isn't looking for a street sign obviously and

26:19.760 --> 26:23.600
nor is he intending to be where his truck currently is and we know that because of the

26:23.600 --> 26:28.800
end of Zimmerman's police call. So he's still poking about looking for Martin, he doesn't want

26:28.800 --> 26:35.120
this asshole to get away. Then him and Martin meet on the intersection behind the houses.

26:35.120 --> 26:39.680
Zimmerman's friend who he was still on the phone with testified in court that at this point Martin

26:39.760 --> 26:46.480
stated Zimmerman was still following him. So that backs up this theory of what Zimmerman was up to.

26:46.480 --> 26:52.800
So let's get into Zimmerman's mindset here. He thinks Martin is a dangerous criminal suspect.

26:52.800 --> 26:57.920
He's up to no good. He might be on drugs and Zimmerman states he's got his hand in his

26:57.920 --> 27:03.840
waistband and later something's wrong with him. He's got something in his hands indicating he

27:03.840 --> 27:10.480
thinks Martin might be armed. So then, you're in a dark alley and you're confronted by who you

27:10.480 --> 27:17.200
suspect to be an armed and dangerous criminal who's on drugs. Now what would you do in that situation?

27:17.200 --> 27:24.720
Well, Zimmerman claims he reached for his phone to dial 911. Now I don't buy this at all, you know,

27:24.720 --> 27:29.200
excuse me Mr Dangerous Armed Criminal could you hold still for a few minutes while I call the

27:29.200 --> 27:35.520
police on you right in front of you. No, that doesn't make any sense to me. What would make

27:35.520 --> 27:41.040
sense to me in this situation is someone reaching for their gun. Now there's a few issues here.

27:41.040 --> 27:46.800
Firstly, Florida is a concealed carry state and Zimmerman had a concealed carry permit.

27:46.800 --> 27:52.720
Open carry is generally banned. Now if you're correct in your assessment of the person being

27:52.720 --> 27:57.120
a dangerous armed criminal then of course you'd be in the right to reach for your gun to defend

27:57.120 --> 28:02.640
yourself but if you later turned out to be wrong and your dangerous armed criminal turned out to

28:02.640 --> 28:09.360
be an unarmed teenager walking home from the store then you're fucked because drawing, reaching for,

28:09.360 --> 28:14.480
or flashing your gun would make you the aggressor and initiator of the physical confrontation and

28:14.480 --> 28:21.040
then you're going to prison. So beyond my own estimation of what was the most likely series of

28:21.040 --> 28:27.360
events, what evidence do I have that Zimmerman reached for his gun? Well, nothing that would

28:27.360 --> 28:33.280
stand up in court admittedly but there is something else that leads me to believe that is what happened.

28:33.280 --> 28:38.960
"...from but he was about where you were and I said I don't have a problem and I went to go grab

28:38.960 --> 28:44.640
my cell phone but my I left it in a different pocket and I went I looked down in my hand pocket

28:44.640 --> 28:49.360
and he said you got a problem now and then he was here and he punched me in the face."

28:49.360 --> 28:55.840
So Zimmerman here indicates that he tried to find his phone to call 911 but he had moved his phone

28:55.840 --> 29:01.040
to a different pocket and looks down to his right side to indicate that's where he reached for it

29:01.600 --> 29:06.000
and this is significant because this is also the area of his body where his gun was.

29:06.560 --> 29:12.720
"...but uh that's when my jacket moved up and I had my my firearm on my right side hit."

29:13.440 --> 29:18.640
Now according to Zimmerman he had only just got off the phone with the non-emergency police line

29:18.640 --> 29:24.160
so he had just put his phone away only a few moments ago according to his timeline

29:24.800 --> 29:30.480
and now he suddenly can't remember where it is. So Zimmerman, when confronted by who he thinks

29:30.480 --> 29:36.640
is a dangerous armed criminal in a dark alley, coincidentally reaches to check for his phone

29:36.640 --> 29:42.800
in the right side pocket where his gun happens to be. I don't know, it is possible but it's

29:42.800 --> 29:48.400
awfully convenient and now you might be thinking why would Zimmerman bother to lie about this?

29:48.400 --> 29:53.920
He's the only living witness to the start of the fight so he can make up whatever story he likes

29:53.920 --> 29:59.520
and the answer there is that Zimmerman at this point knew there was a witness to the incident

29:59.520 --> 30:04.880
but didn't have any indication how much of the event they had actually been witnessed to.

30:04.880 --> 30:08.880
From Zimmerman's interview with the police on the night of the shooting he says

30:08.880 --> 30:13.760
Then somebody comes out and I couldn't see. There was a flashlight in my head so I asked if it was

30:13.760 --> 30:20.160
a police officer and he said no it was a witness but he was calling the police and I said the

30:20.160 --> 30:26.160
police are on their way. So present in Zimmerman's mind during the police walkthrough is the existence

30:26.160 --> 30:32.640
of a witness who could have possibly seen any part of the event which means he needs to account for

30:32.640 --> 30:38.640
his actions including that of reaching for his gun. So that's why his phone goes missing only

30:38.640 --> 30:44.000
seconds after he put it away and why he not so coincidentally reaches to that area of his body

30:44.560 --> 30:49.840
right before Martin hits him. So actually Zimmerman faced with what he incorrectly

30:49.840 --> 30:55.040
thought was a dangerous criminal reached for his gun and Trayvon Martin chased down an alley by

30:55.040 --> 31:03.360
a stranger who then reached for his gun defended himself. Is that what happened? Well probably we

31:03.360 --> 31:09.840
can't know for sure. There was actually no witness to the start of the fight no CCTV footage and that

31:09.840 --> 31:17.040
series of events while likely wouldn't stand up in court. I haven't proved anything there and that's

31:17.040 --> 31:21.920
because it's impossible to prove. Zimmerman should never have been charged with something that it was

31:21.920 --> 31:26.720
impossible to prove in court and I'd like to highlight something here in conclusion to this

31:26.720 --> 31:31.920
section. I just talked about the Trayvon Martin case without once descending into the ridiculous

31:31.920 --> 31:37.840
character assassinations that were rampant in the American media during the trial. Trayvon Martin

31:37.840 --> 31:43.760
smoked weed you know the drug that notoriously makes people really angry and confrontational.

31:43.760 --> 31:49.200
Trayvon Martin posted a photograph of a gun on social media that's apparently more of an

31:49.200 --> 31:54.400
indication of violent tendencies than owning carrying and actually shooting someone with a gun.

31:54.960 --> 31:59.920
Now this is the other tactic for justifying Zimmerman's actions saying Trayvon was obviously

31:59.920 --> 32:07.360
a bad guy since he did x or y common teenage activity and that's just disgusting and shameful

32:07.360 --> 32:12.960
behavior to be honest. Until the legal punishment for skipping school or smoking weed or whatever

32:12.960 --> 32:18.960
is the death penalty people can stuff those sorts of justifications right up their back holes.

32:19.520 --> 32:24.880
So anyway what I hope I have proved during that little analysis of the Trayvon Martin case

32:24.880 --> 32:31.200
is that there is no avenue whatsoever for laying blame upon Trayvon Martin and again in summary

32:31.200 --> 32:35.600
any injury Zimmerman sustained could have been perfectly legally inflicted. Unless you have

32:35.600 --> 32:41.040
evidence that Trayvon Martin started the fight Zimmerman's injuries are no justification.

32:41.040 --> 32:46.240
Trayvon Martin still being between the houses and not returning home is also no justification.

32:46.240 --> 32:50.880
Zimmerman also had no reason to be there and even if Martin did confront Zimmerman

32:50.880 --> 32:56.400
that doesn't prove who initiated the physical confrontation which is the important thing.

32:56.400 --> 33:01.200
There is nothing you can accuse Martin of that is not also true of Zimmerman and so the most

33:01.200 --> 33:06.880
pro-Zimmerman position I will accept as legitimate here is one of complete neutrality. The only

33:06.880 --> 33:11.760
logical explanation I have for explaining why people would actually openly justify Zimmerman's

33:11.760 --> 33:17.600
actions is because they are racially biased whether consciously or not. Absolutely none of

33:17.600 --> 33:22.560
the evidence implicates Martin as doing anything illegal at any point other than the testimony of

33:22.560 --> 33:28.320
a man who has an enormous incentive to lie and thus whose account cannot be trusted. If you

33:28.320 --> 33:35.200
favor Zimmerman's account of the incident you are by process of elimination either a fool or racially

33:35.200 --> 33:40.880
biased. Now I stated earlier that I could prove that a racial bias exists in the response to

33:40.880 --> 33:46.400
cases like this and so let's take a look at that and for this last section of the video we need to

33:46.400 --> 33:54.880
know about the shooting of Lavoie Finicum. So on January 2nd 2016 an armed group led by Ammon Bundy

33:54.880 --> 34:02.320
of the 2014 Bundy standoff seized and occupied the National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County in

34:02.320 --> 34:10.800
Oregon. They did this for some stupid reason whatever it doesn't matter. On January 26th

34:10.800 --> 34:16.320
two trucks carrying Ammon Bundy, Lavoie Finicum and others left the refuge to travel to a meeting

34:16.320 --> 34:22.480
in an adjacent county and the FBI used this opportunity to intercept the trucks and arrest

34:22.480 --> 34:28.480
the group. One truck stopped but the other of which Lavoie Finicum was the driver led the

34:28.480 --> 34:34.080
police on a high-speed chase with Lavoie Finicum shouting that the only way the police could stop

34:34.080 --> 34:39.680
him was to shoot him. A mile down the road Finicum's truck encountered an FBI roadblock

34:39.680 --> 34:44.560
where he crashed left the truck armed with a gun and approached police who fatally shot him.

34:45.440 --> 34:50.400
Now whatever you think about the legitimacy of the police shooting of Lavoie Finicum the facts

34:50.400 --> 34:55.120
are that he was involved in an armed takeover and occupation of a government building led the

34:55.120 --> 34:59.840
police on a high-speed chase told the police he wouldn't stop until he was killed and crashed

34:59.840 --> 35:03.840
his car at a police roadblock and then approached them armed with a gun and it really is amazing

35:03.840 --> 35:08.960
what you have to do to get the police to shoot you if you're an older white guy in a cowboy hat

35:08.960 --> 35:13.440
and all of this was recorded by both a police helicopter and camera footage from inside the

35:13.440 --> 35:18.320
truck and I want to make clear here that I'm not celebrating or laughing about the man's death in

35:18.320 --> 35:24.800
any way but it was entirely avoidable by him. For the other truck that stopped when the police asked

35:24.800 --> 35:31.440
all occupants were arrested peacefully. Lavoie Finicum did not have to die and it was clearly

35:31.440 --> 35:37.360
his own actions that brought about his shooting. So why am I telling you about this incident? Well

35:37.360 --> 35:43.200
it serves as a very useful comparison to the shootings of various young black men including

35:43.200 --> 35:49.040
Trayvon Martin because thanks to the permanent record of the internet it means that I get to do

35:49.040 --> 35:56.000
this. Keith Roadbush on twitter says Finicum was simply murdered by scared cops who don't know how

35:56.000 --> 36:02.240
to handle it when someone else is armed and trained. Finicum never hurt anyone. For Trayvon

36:02.240 --> 36:06.960
Martin however, Keith says my solemn prayer is that Trayvon will serve to teach young black

36:06.960 --> 36:13.280
Americans the thug-like gang-banging stealing and dope-smoking life is futile. Holly Ammon on

36:13.280 --> 36:19.600
twitter says an innocent man was gunned. Lavoie Finicum did nothing wrong. These men, all of them,

36:19.600 --> 36:24.640
did nothing wrong. Yeah other than occupy a federal building and lead the police on high

36:24.640 --> 36:31.280
speed chase, Holly. For Trayvon Martin however, Holly says Trayvon was just a big black thug.

36:31.280 --> 36:36.800
BlueVino on twitter says it's kind of rude to forget that Lavoie Finicum was shot and killed

36:36.800 --> 36:42.640
while unarmed. In actuality it's kind of rude to forget that he was really armed with a gun.

36:42.880 --> 36:49.920
BlueVino. Anyway for Trayvon Martin, BlueVino says the death was Trayvon's fault for attacking.

36:49.920 --> 36:57.280
Trayvon had no right to attack. Trayvon initiated violence. Waifu Kaori says one confirmed dead

36:57.280 --> 37:04.160
Lavoie Finicum hold these people accountable. Should we also hold George Zimmerman accountable

37:04.160 --> 37:10.640
though? Apparently not. The hero George Zimmerman is going to donate money from his gun auction to

37:10.640 --> 37:17.360
fight the Black Lives Matter terrorists. What a great man. Ginger Merritt on twitter says

37:17.360 --> 37:23.520
Lavoie Finicum was murdered in cold blood and then quotes a bible passage. For Trayvon Martin

37:23.520 --> 37:29.520
however, she says God protected someone Trayvon Martin would have assaulted. So God works in

37:29.520 --> 37:36.400
mysterious and apparently racially biased ways it seems. D. Claire Diane claims Lavoie Finicum

37:36.400 --> 37:42.960
was murdered in the first degree but elsewhere states Trayvon Martin was a black thug. And it

37:42.960 --> 37:48.720
goes on, you get the point. And you can compare the shooting of the armed Lavoie Finicum to other

37:48.720 --> 37:56.880
shootings of unarmed black people as it turns out. At Radical RW on twitter says Lavoie Finicum was

37:56.880 --> 38:02.640
murdered in the first degree but for the case of Tamia Rice, the 12 year old shot by police while

38:02.640 --> 38:09.280
playing in a park, they say some idiot pulled a fake gun on a cop and got shot. What did he

38:09.280 --> 38:14.800
think would happen? Radical RW doesn't bother asking what Lavoie Finicum thought would happen

38:14.800 --> 38:20.640
when he ran a police roadblock however. There can be no explanation for this obvious contradiction

38:20.640 --> 38:27.360
in reactions except for racial bias. When an armed white criminal is considered less dangerous than

38:27.360 --> 38:34.720
an unarmed black teenager, what other explanation could there possibly be? So don't be like these

38:34.720 --> 38:41.040
people I guess is my point. Don't go for the easy excuse. Put some thought into your opinions and

38:41.040 --> 38:48.480
also consider why you hold those opinions that you do. Now I intentionally called George Zimmerman

38:48.480 --> 38:55.120
white in the first minute of this video and I did that for a reason. One point that was repeated

38:55.120 --> 39:01.120
constantly during the trial was that Zimmerman was not white, he's hispanic and therefore this

39:01.120 --> 39:07.680
isn't a white black race thing you know. Which is pretty racist in itself to be honest but I called

39:07.680 --> 39:13.520
Zimmerman white because that is what he himself identifies as. He says he's white in the police

39:13.520 --> 39:19.200
interviews because of course hispanic isn't a skin color. You can have white hispanic people and

39:19.200 --> 39:25.280
black hispanic people and whatever else. Claiming Zimmerman to be hispanic not white portrays an

39:25.280 --> 39:31.280
ignorance both of the facts of the case and of the relevant racial terminology. So I called

39:31.280 --> 39:37.440
Zimmerman white early on deliberately to trip up any youtube commenters who don't listen to

39:37.440 --> 39:43.600
arguments and don't watch the whole video. So anyone who comments Zimmerman was actually hispanic

39:43.600 --> 39:49.360
haha you're wrong beneath this video I'm here preemptively shaming you. Thanks a lot for

39:49.360 --> 39:55.920
watching everyone. Another day, another depressing video. I apologize. I have one about the British

39:55.920 --> 40:02.320
Empire in the works. I'm sure that's not going to be too cheery either. Maybe eventually I'll run out

40:02.320 --> 40:07.120
of darker topics and we can talk about something pleasant for a change. Wouldn't that be nice?

40:07.760 --> 40:12.800
Thanks as always to all my patrons scrolling by right now who enable me to keep making videos

40:12.800 --> 40:18.480
like this one so if you want more videos like this consider sending me a dolly yourself and

40:18.480 --> 40:23.920
also maybe check out the other creators that I personally support on patreon all of whom are

40:23.920 --> 40:30.880
very interesting folks who create awesome things and are definitely worth having a p-cat also also

40:30.880 --> 40:35.600
follow me on twitter and send me a curious cat question if you like I try to answer at least

40:35.600 --> 40:39.680
some of them rightio thanks folks I'll see you soon
