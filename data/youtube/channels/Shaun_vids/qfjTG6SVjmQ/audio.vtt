00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
Hello, everyone.

00:01.800 --> 00:06.980
This video is a follow-up to a recent video of mine about a dreadful transphobic article

00:06.980 --> 00:10.060
published by the BBC on their website.

00:10.060 --> 00:14.280
If you haven't seen that video, I'd encourage you to watch that one first to get caught

00:14.280 --> 00:15.280
up.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.280
It isn't very long, and I'll include a link to it below in the video description.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.980
Right, so, welcome to round two.

00:22.980 --> 00:28.080
Following on directly from that last video, the BBC have been sending out responses to

00:28.080 --> 00:30.960
the various complaints people made about the article.

00:30.960 --> 00:35.280
I posted on Twitter asking people to share with me the text of their complaints and also

00:35.280 --> 00:40.220
the BBC response, which a very large number of people did, and I'd like to say thank

00:40.220 --> 00:43.260
you very much to everyone who took the time to share that with me.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.860
It was very useful.

00:44.860 --> 00:50.960
So the BBC have so far been sending out two responses, both of which are predictably utterly

00:50.960 --> 00:52.140
rubbish.

00:52.140 --> 00:56.580
The first response is a general defence of the article, its aims, and in particular its

00:56.580 --> 01:01.040
inclusion of the Get the L Out survey, and this appears to have been sent en masse in

01:01.040 --> 01:07.280
response to a variety of different complaints, but in particular ones that focus on the survey.

01:07.280 --> 01:12.100
The second response, which I and many others received, is a defence of the author of the

01:12.100 --> 01:15.020
article choosing not to include Chelsea Poe.

01:15.020 --> 01:20.020
Now this is inadequate because my complaint was not that the article did not include Chelsea

01:20.020 --> 01:24.980
Poe, it was that the author of the article interviewed Chelsea Poe and then lied that

01:24.980 --> 01:26.480
she did not.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.640
So we're going to read these two responses, identify the places where the BBC is deliberately

01:31.640 --> 01:36.380
missing the point, and then discuss how we're going to escalate this.

01:36.380 --> 01:40.420
The first response opens by saying that they've received feedback from people who have found

01:40.420 --> 01:45.260
the article challenging, as if it's some work of genius we just haven't comprehended

01:45.260 --> 01:49.220
yet instead of vile discriminatory hate speech.

01:49.220 --> 01:53.280
It then says that the article was carefully considered before publication and went through

01:53.280 --> 01:55.820
an internal editorial review process.

01:55.820 --> 02:01.380
Now this is not a defence of the article, it is a condemnation of their editorial review

02:01.380 --> 02:02.600
process.

02:02.600 --> 02:08.140
Do the BBC expect us to believe that this article was carefully reviewed before publication,

02:08.140 --> 02:13.940
but that nobody noticed the multiple quotes from an enormous photograph of the rapist

02:13.940 --> 02:18.980
in the middle of the article, who they later had to cut from the article?

02:18.980 --> 02:24.140
Either the review process didn't catch Lily Cade's inclusion, or they didn't care,

02:24.140 --> 02:28.860
either one of which means their review process is not fit for purpose.

02:28.860 --> 02:33.700
The response then moves on to defend the inclusion of the Get The L Out survey, saying,

02:33.700 --> 02:37.140
It's been argued by some people that the article is flawed because it's based on

02:37.140 --> 02:39.060
a survey of 80 people.

02:39.060 --> 02:43.300
However, the article itself states there is little research in this area, that the survey

02:43.300 --> 02:47.980
featured was conducted on social media and is therefore self-selecting, and that even

02:47.980 --> 02:52.180
the author of the survey admits it may not be a representative sample.

02:52.180 --> 02:54.220
Now the issue with this is twofold.

02:54.220 --> 02:58.900
Firstly, although it begins with the word however, the second sentence here does not

02:58.900 --> 03:00.600
contradict the first.

03:00.600 --> 03:05.980
The charge is that the survey is biased and flawed, and the BBC responses to say we know,

03:05.980 --> 03:07.860
but we admitted that.

03:07.860 --> 03:10.220
Now that's not an answer.

03:10.220 --> 03:14.600
The fact that there is quote little research in this area doesn't give you a green light

03:14.600 --> 03:19.420
to base your arguments on bad research, even if you admit it's bad.

03:19.420 --> 03:24.700
There could be little research in this area because the area in question is a foundationless

03:24.700 --> 03:28.180
moral panic invented by hate groups.

03:28.180 --> 03:33.700
The other issue here is that the BBC is not mentioning the transphobia, the bigotry, the

03:33.700 --> 03:35.940
discrimination in the survey.

03:35.940 --> 03:40.160
It is pretending that all complaints about the survey have been because it is of strictly

03:40.160 --> 03:45.900
poor academic quality, which it is, but that isn't the main problem with it.

03:45.900 --> 03:50.700
The survey deliberately and repeatedly refuses to gender trans people correctly.

03:50.700 --> 03:56.960
It approvingly includes the quote, all transsexuals rape women's bodies, and states in reference

03:56.960 --> 04:01.220
to this quote that this analysis remains as relevant as ever.

04:01.220 --> 04:05.760
So when the response goes on to say that furthermore, there is a link to the details of the findings

04:05.760 --> 04:09.220
of the survey in the article, that's worse than not linking to it.

04:09.220 --> 04:10.820
I hope you understand.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.740
This open hate speech is linked in the article.

04:13.740 --> 04:16.660
It's just a click away from the BBC website.

04:16.660 --> 04:22.580
The rest of the response deals with impartiality, saying we have a strong commitment to impartiality,

04:22.580 --> 04:27.780
which means we constantly consider and evaluate which stories to cover and how.

04:27.780 --> 04:33.740
Impartiality is fundamental and includes covering stories on any point of the spectrum of debate.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.660
Now this impartiality talk is quite revealing.

04:37.660 --> 04:42.780
First off here, if we look at the BBC's editorial guidelines in the section Impartiality and

04:42.820 --> 04:48.660
Racism, the first heading in that section reads in big bold letters, the BBC is not

04:48.660 --> 04:55.380
impartial on racism and it calls opposition to racism a fundamental democratic principle.

04:55.380 --> 05:02.260
So let's say a racist group in the UK, patriotic alternative we'll imagine, puts out a self

05:02.260 --> 05:08.500
selecting survey of its social media followers and asks them their thoughts about immigrants.

05:08.500 --> 05:13.980
And then let's say they pepper their findings with quotes referring to immigrants as rapists.

05:13.980 --> 05:18.620
Would the BBC approvingly share and link to that survey?

05:18.620 --> 05:21.180
No, it wouldn't.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.820
Hopefully not anyway.

05:22.820 --> 05:28.820
The BBC would say, this is obvious racist hate speech put out by a clearly biased group

05:28.820 --> 05:34.740
clumsily dressed up as an academic study and we will not share it because the BBC is not

05:34.740 --> 05:37.640
impartial on racism.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.200
Racism is not to be debated.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.200
When it comes to trans issues, however, the BBC has done the exact equivalent of the scenario

05:45.200 --> 05:46.680
I just described.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.280
They treat trans rights as a debate.

05:49.280 --> 05:55.080
They are giving a platform to groups who want to take away rights that trans people already have.

05:55.080 --> 06:00.600
In casting this as a debate with legitimate opposing sides, in declaring that trans rights

06:00.600 --> 06:06.600
are something one can be impartial about, the BBC are making a political statement here,

06:06.600 --> 06:10.280
regardless of any pretense of journalistic neutrality.

06:10.280 --> 06:15.080
They're saying trans rights are up for debate and groups that want to discriminate against

06:15.080 --> 06:20.480
trans people, that want to take rights away from trans people, they deserve access to

06:20.480 --> 06:22.100
our platform.

06:22.100 --> 06:26.360
But let's put a pin in that for now and move on to talk about the second response, the

06:26.360 --> 06:31.120
one that deals with the author's lie about no high profile trans women wanting to talk

06:31.120 --> 06:32.120
to her.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.320
And this starts out...

07:02.120 --> 07:09.120
Now, this is what the complaint was actually about, this particular lie.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.560
The original article states...

07:18.960 --> 07:23.860
So, high profile trans women who have either written or spoken about sex and relationships

07:23.860 --> 07:26.560
is the definition we're concerned with here.

07:26.600 --> 07:32.160
Now, Chelsea Poe is a trans woman, she was interviewed by the author of the article,

07:32.160 --> 07:36.040
this is beyond dispute, the BBC have admitted to that.

07:36.040 --> 07:41.500
Chelsea Poe has spoken about sex and relationships in various interviews in a range of different

07:41.500 --> 07:45.000
media outlets, this is also beyond dispute.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
The BBC's argument, therefore, hinges solely on the term high profile.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
They say...

07:56.840 --> 08:02.840
In a vacuum, okay, high profile is open to debate, but within the context of the article,

08:02.840 --> 08:04.520
it is absolutely not.

08:04.520 --> 08:09.640
Firstly, Chelsea Poe was high profile enough to be contacted and actually interviewed for

08:09.640 --> 08:11.860
the article in the first place.

08:11.860 --> 08:16.480
Why would they bother doing that if she then wasn't high profile enough to include in the

08:16.480 --> 08:17.480
piece?

08:17.480 --> 08:19.000
That doesn't make sense.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.640
Secondly, the article includes examples of trans women who the author of the article

08:23.640 --> 08:25.920
does feel are high profile.

08:25.920 --> 08:26.920
It says...

08:36.080 --> 08:40.920
Now, one of the people quoted here is a YouTuber with less than 10,000 subscribers, speaking

08:40.920 --> 08:45.840
in a video posted seven years ago that's had about 10,000 views.

08:45.840 --> 08:51.560
Now I'm not sub-count shaming here or anything, but if this source counts as high profile,

08:51.560 --> 08:57.320
then Chelsea Poe must count as high profile, mathematically, because she has more than

08:57.320 --> 09:02.440
double the amount of social media followers as the high profile source in the article.

09:02.440 --> 09:07.320
It isn't numerically possible for this person to be high profile and Chelsea Poe not to

09:07.320 --> 09:08.880
be high profile.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.480
This argument is just pathetic from the BBC.

09:12.480 --> 09:17.040
I can't physically put enough emphasis on the word pathetic here.

09:17.040 --> 09:24.600
For them to be reduced to this childish, petulant shite to cover up a blatant, bigoted lie.

09:24.600 --> 09:29.740
How ridiculous that they would even attempt this, and how shameful that they think it

09:29.740 --> 09:31.200
would work.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.640
The last line of the response basically says we can include whoever we want, screw you.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.920
Which is the same irrelevant point as earlier.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.000
That's not what the complaint was about.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.680
Now then, we've looked at two responses there, and I don't know about you, but I'm not completely

09:45.680 --> 09:47.080
satisfied here.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.100
I don't know if you can tell.

09:49.100 --> 09:53.080
And before I talk about what I'm going to do in response here, I'd like to note a few

09:53.080 --> 09:54.080
things.

09:54.080 --> 09:58.960
Firstly, some of the BBC responses were slow going out, because to quote an email they

09:58.960 --> 10:04.120
sent about the delay, we're currently dealing with a higher than normal volume of cases.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.060
So they were snowed under, basically.

10:06.060 --> 10:09.520
They got too many complaints to deal with in the normal way.

10:09.520 --> 10:14.380
Next, having read a lot of these complaints, I know that the BBC have thus far sent these

10:14.380 --> 10:19.020
two responses out to basically every complaint they received, even in cases where they're

10:19.020 --> 10:20.800
entirely inadequate.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.820
I mean, they're always inadequate, but...

10:22.820 --> 10:27.000
There are a lot of people out there who complained, for instance, about the inclusion of Lily

10:27.000 --> 10:32.980
Cade, then the Get the L Out survey, and then the lie about Chelsea Poe, but who got a response

10:32.980 --> 10:37.780
which only addressed the lie about Chelsea Poe and ignored the rest.

10:37.780 --> 10:43.180
Every complaint I read had something or other that went deliberately unanswered by the BBC.

10:43.180 --> 10:48.120
And most common of these was, as I mentioned earlier, complaints about transphobia.

10:48.120 --> 10:52.980
It's very clear that the BBC absolutely does not want to engage on any level with talk

10:52.980 --> 10:54.580
about transphobia here.

10:54.580 --> 11:00.060
If, for instance, you complain about the survey misgendering trans people, the BBC will respond

11:00.060 --> 11:04.840
by talking about sample sizes and lack of other research and so on, as if you merely

11:04.840 --> 11:08.560
made a dry academic complaint about survey quality.

11:08.560 --> 11:13.060
They are deliberately missing the point, because they don't want to make a statement about

11:13.060 --> 11:14.140
transphobia.

11:14.140 --> 11:18.740
They don't want to say, yes, we think it's okay for us to platform groups that misgender

11:18.740 --> 11:23.940
trans people, that call trans people rapists, that want to take away trans rights.

11:23.940 --> 11:26.820
So with all that in mind, here's what I'm gonna do.

11:26.820 --> 11:31.700
Firstly, I'm going to escalate my initial complaint about the lie about Chelsea Poe.

11:31.700 --> 11:36.020
I'm gonna do that in the same way as the last complaint by going to the BBC complaints page

11:36.020 --> 11:41.740
linked below, selecting BBC website or apps, BBC news website, I'm going to paste the link

11:41.740 --> 11:46.500
to the article, but then when it says, are you contacting us about a previous complaint,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.380
I'm going to say yes.

11:48.380 --> 11:52.660
On the next page, I'm going to paste the reference code for the complaint I made and explain

11:52.660 --> 11:57.360
as precisely as I can how their response was inadequate and failed to answer what I was

11:57.360 --> 12:00.900
complaining about, as if they don't already know that.

12:00.900 --> 12:05.620
Next, I'm going to submit a new complaint about this article, but before I get into

12:05.620 --> 12:09.060
what I'm gonna say, a few points about the process here.

12:09.100 --> 12:12.860
Firstly, we're going to be in this for the long haul, it looks like.

12:12.860 --> 12:17.780
How this works is that you complain once, then once the BBC respond, you can escalate,

12:17.780 --> 12:19.660
which is where we are now.

12:19.660 --> 12:22.560
Then when they respond to that, you can escalate again.

12:22.560 --> 12:27.040
And after their next response, if you're still not satisfied that they answered your complaint,

12:27.040 --> 12:30.860
you can contact Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator.

12:30.860 --> 12:34.660
Now there's obviously a delay between each of their responses, especially since they're

12:34.660 --> 12:39.900
dealing with a higher volume of cases at the moment for some reason, so this is going

12:39.900 --> 12:42.100
to take a while, I'm afraid.

12:42.100 --> 12:47.860
Next up, the BBC only accepts initial complaints for 30 working days after material is published,

12:47.860 --> 12:52.700
and 30 working days after the article in question was published is Monday.

12:52.700 --> 12:57.460
So if you haven't submitted an initial complaint by Monday, you usually will not be able to

12:57.460 --> 12:59.100
start the complaints process.

12:59.100 --> 13:03.500
So if you have not complained thus far but would like to, or if you have already complained

13:03.500 --> 13:08.020
but suddenly get the urge in the next five minutes to submit a new complaint as well,

13:08.020 --> 13:10.580
I'd advise that you do that as soon as possible.

13:10.580 --> 13:15.360
Also after the first complaint, you usually can't add any new information during the process.

13:15.360 --> 13:21.260
They will only respond, or not respond as it is, to points made in the initial complaint.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.700
So be aware of that.

13:22.700 --> 13:27.240
Whatever you ultimately want answered here has to be in the initial message.

13:27.240 --> 13:31.660
With that in mind, my new complaint is going to be specifically about the transphobia in

13:31.660 --> 13:33.340
the Get the L Out survey.

13:33.340 --> 13:37.340
I don't like the BBC refusing to address the transphobia.

13:37.340 --> 13:42.900
I don't like them deliberately dodging questions about it by pretending to hear something else.

13:42.900 --> 13:50.260
I want them to answer for this, for the bigotry, for the transphobia specifically and directly.

13:50.260 --> 13:54.860
So I'm going to complain about the article linking to a survey which refuses to gender

13:54.860 --> 13:59.140
trans people correctly, likens trans people to rapists, and so on.

13:59.140 --> 14:05.100
But I'm also going to say that I have absolutely no issues whatsoever with the survey's sample

14:05.100 --> 14:08.380
size, distribution method, or findings.

14:08.380 --> 14:13.220
For the purposes of this complaint, I have zero issues with either this survey or the

14:13.220 --> 14:17.980
article it's featured in, with the singular exception of the transphobic language in the

14:17.980 --> 14:18.980
survey.

14:18.980 --> 14:25.660
That is the sole issue I am concerned with and require a response for, the BBC, if you

14:25.660 --> 14:27.460
would be so kind.

14:27.460 --> 14:32.380
Now my aim here, of course, is to force them to make a statement specifically regarding

14:32.380 --> 14:37.060
the transphobia and their promotion of it, and I'm starting out with a message that gives

14:37.060 --> 14:42.380
them as few ways as possible to weasel out of answering me so that when this complaint

14:42.380 --> 14:46.580
is escalated, hopefully they will have nowhere to hide.

14:46.580 --> 14:51.740
I'm going to keep escalating my complaints and I would encourage very strongly anyone

14:51.740 --> 14:56.800
who already feels like doing so, of course, to escalate their initial complaint or submit

14:56.800 --> 14:58.120
one for the first time.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.880
There is a link below.

14:59.880 --> 15:04.640
And again, I'm not telling you what to do here, of course, but I did release this video

15:04.640 --> 15:10.360
after work hours on a Friday, coincidentally, and I think it would be swell if the BBC turn

15:10.360 --> 15:15.240
up for work on Monday with some things to consider in their inbox.

15:15.240 --> 15:22.240
Now, I do realize I'm getting a little Captain Ahab about all of this, and I apologize.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.200
I will continue to make videos about other things.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.880
We are not in for six months of me ranting at the BBC here.

15:29.880 --> 15:36.040
Well, we are in for that, actually, it looks like, but I will try and do other stuff too,

15:36.040 --> 15:36.640
I promise.
