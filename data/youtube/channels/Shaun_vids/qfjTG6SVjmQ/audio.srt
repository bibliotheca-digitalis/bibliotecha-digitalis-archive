1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,980
This video is a follow-up to a recent video of mine about a dreadful transphobic article

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,060
published by the BBC on their website.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,280
If you haven't seen that video, I'd encourage you to watch that one first to get caught

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
up.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,280
It isn't very long, and I'll include a link to it below in the video description.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,980
Right, so, welcome to round two.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,080
Following on directly from that last video, the BBC have been sending out responses to

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,960
the various complaints people made about the article.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,280
I posted on Twitter asking people to share with me the text of their complaints and also

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,220
the BBC response, which a very large number of people did, and I'd like to say thank

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,260
you very much to everyone who took the time to share that with me.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,860
It was very useful.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,960
So the BBC have so far been sending out two responses, both of which are predictably utterly

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,140
rubbish.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,580
The first response is a general defence of the article, its aims, and in particular its

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,040
inclusion of the Get the L Out survey, and this appears to have been sent en masse in

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,280
response to a variety of different complaints, but in particular ones that focus on the survey.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,100
The second response, which I and many others received, is a defence of the author of the

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,020
article choosing not to include Chelsea Poe.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,020
Now this is inadequate because my complaint was not that the article did not include Chelsea

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,980
Poe, it was that the author of the article interviewed Chelsea Poe and then lied that

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,480
she did not.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,640
So we're going to read these two responses, identify the places where the BBC is deliberately

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,380
missing the point, and then discuss how we're going to escalate this.

26
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,420
The first response opens by saying that they've received feedback from people who have found

27
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,260
the article challenging, as if it's some work of genius we just haven't comprehended

28
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,220
yet instead of vile discriminatory hate speech.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,280
It then says that the article was carefully considered before publication and went through

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,820
an internal editorial review process.

31
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,380
Now this is not a defence of the article, it is a condemnation of their editorial review

32
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,600
process.

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,140
Do the BBC expect us to believe that this article was carefully reviewed before publication,

34
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,940
but that nobody noticed the multiple quotes from an enormous photograph of the rapist

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,980
in the middle of the article, who they later had to cut from the article?

36
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,140
Either the review process didn't catch Lily Cade's inclusion, or they didn't care,

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,860
either one of which means their review process is not fit for purpose.

38
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,700
The response then moves on to defend the inclusion of the Get The L Out survey, saying,

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,140
It's been argued by some people that the article is flawed because it's based on

40
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,060
a survey of 80 people.

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,300
However, the article itself states there is little research in this area, that the survey

42
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,980
featured was conducted on social media and is therefore self-selecting, and that even

43
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,180
the author of the survey admits it may not be a representative sample.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,220
Now the issue with this is twofold.

45
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,900
Firstly, although it begins with the word however, the second sentence here does not

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,600
contradict the first.

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,980
The charge is that the survey is biased and flawed, and the BBC responses to say we know,

48
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,860
but we admitted that.

49
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,220
Now that's not an answer.

50
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,600
The fact that there is quote little research in this area doesn't give you a green light

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,420
to base your arguments on bad research, even if you admit it's bad.

52
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,700
There could be little research in this area because the area in question is a foundationless

53
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,180
moral panic invented by hate groups.

54
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,700
The other issue here is that the BBC is not mentioning the transphobia, the bigotry, the

55
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,940
discrimination in the survey.

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,160
It is pretending that all complaints about the survey have been because it is of strictly

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,900
poor academic quality, which it is, but that isn't the main problem with it.

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,700
The survey deliberately and repeatedly refuses to gender trans people correctly.

59
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,960
It approvingly includes the quote, all transsexuals rape women's bodies, and states in reference

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,220
to this quote that this analysis remains as relevant as ever.

61
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,760
So when the response goes on to say that furthermore, there is a link to the details of the findings

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,220
of the survey in the article, that's worse than not linking to it.

63
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,820
I hope you understand.

64
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,740
This open hate speech is linked in the article.

65
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,660
It's just a click away from the BBC website.

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,580
The rest of the response deals with impartiality, saying we have a strong commitment to impartiality,

67
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,780
which means we constantly consider and evaluate which stories to cover and how.

68
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,740
Impartiality is fundamental and includes covering stories on any point of the spectrum of debate.

69
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,660
Now this impartiality talk is quite revealing.

70
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,780
First off here, if we look at the BBC's editorial guidelines in the section Impartiality and

71
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,660
Racism, the first heading in that section reads in big bold letters, the BBC is not

72
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,380
impartial on racism and it calls opposition to racism a fundamental democratic principle.

73
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,260
So let's say a racist group in the UK, patriotic alternative we'll imagine, puts out a self

74
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:08,500
selecting survey of its social media followers and asks them their thoughts about immigrants.

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,980
And then let's say they pepper their findings with quotes referring to immigrants as rapists.

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,620
Would the BBC approvingly share and link to that survey?

77
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,180
No, it wouldn't.

78
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,820
Hopefully not anyway.

79
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,820
The BBC would say, this is obvious racist hate speech put out by a clearly biased group

80
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,740
clumsily dressed up as an academic study and we will not share it because the BBC is not

81
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,640
impartial on racism.

82
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,200
Racism is not to be debated.

83
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,200
When it comes to trans issues, however, the BBC has done the exact equivalent of the scenario

84
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,680
I just described.

85
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,280
They treat trans rights as a debate.

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,080
They are giving a platform to groups who want to take away rights that trans people already have.

87
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,600
In casting this as a debate with legitimate opposing sides, in declaring that trans rights

88
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,600
are something one can be impartial about, the BBC are making a political statement here,

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,280
regardless of any pretense of journalistic neutrality.

90
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,080
They're saying trans rights are up for debate and groups that want to discriminate against

91
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,480
trans people, that want to take rights away from trans people, they deserve access to

92
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,100
our platform.

93
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,360
But let's put a pin in that for now and move on to talk about the second response, the

94
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,120
one that deals with the author's lie about no high profile trans women wanting to talk

95
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
to her.

96
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,320
And this starts out...

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Now, this is what the complaint was actually about, this particular lie.

98
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
The original article states...

99
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,860
So, high profile trans women who have either written or spoken about sex and relationships

100
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,560
is the definition we're concerned with here.

101
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,160
Now, Chelsea Poe is a trans woman, she was interviewed by the author of the article,

102
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,040
this is beyond dispute, the BBC have admitted to that.

103
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,500
Chelsea Poe has spoken about sex and relationships in various interviews in a range of different

104
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,000
media outlets, this is also beyond dispute.

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The BBC's argument, therefore, hinges solely on the term high profile.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They say...

107
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,840
In a vacuum, okay, high profile is open to debate, but within the context of the article,

108
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,520
it is absolutely not.

109
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,640
Firstly, Chelsea Poe was high profile enough to be contacted and actually interviewed for

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,860
the article in the first place.

111
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,480
Why would they bother doing that if she then wasn't high profile enough to include in the

112
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
piece?

113
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
That doesn't make sense.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,640
Secondly, the article includes examples of trans women who the author of the article

115
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,920
does feel are high profile.

116
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
It says...

117
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,920
Now, one of the people quoted here is a YouTuber with less than 10,000 subscribers, speaking

118
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,840
in a video posted seven years ago that's had about 10,000 views.

119
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,560
Now I'm not sub-count shaming here or anything, but if this source counts as high profile,

120
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,320
then Chelsea Poe must count as high profile, mathematically, because she has more than

121
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,440
double the amount of social media followers as the high profile source in the article.

122
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,320
It isn't numerically possible for this person to be high profile and Chelsea Poe not to

123
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,880
be high profile.

124
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,480
This argument is just pathetic from the BBC.

125
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,040
I can't physically put enough emphasis on the word pathetic here.

126
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:24,600
For them to be reduced to this childish, petulant shite to cover up a blatant, bigoted lie.

127
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,740
How ridiculous that they would even attempt this, and how shameful that they think it

128
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,200
would work.

129
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,640
The last line of the response basically says we can include whoever we want, screw you.

130
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,920
Which is the same irrelevant point as earlier.

131
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
That's not what the complaint was about.

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,680
Now then, we've looked at two responses there, and I don't know about you, but I'm not completely

133
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,080
satisfied here.

134
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,100
I don't know if you can tell.

135
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,080
And before I talk about what I'm going to do in response here, I'd like to note a few

136
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
things.

137
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,960
Firstly, some of the BBC responses were slow going out, because to quote an email they

138
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,120
sent about the delay, we're currently dealing with a higher than normal volume of cases.

139
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,060
So they were snowed under, basically.

140
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,520
They got too many complaints to deal with in the normal way.

141
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,380
Next, having read a lot of these complaints, I know that the BBC have thus far sent these

142
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,020
two responses out to basically every complaint they received, even in cases where they're

143
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,800
entirely inadequate.

144
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,820
I mean, they're always inadequate, but...

145
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,000
There are a lot of people out there who complained, for instance, about the inclusion of Lily

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,980
Cade, then the Get the L Out survey, and then the lie about Chelsea Poe, but who got a response

147
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,780
which only addressed the lie about Chelsea Poe and ignored the rest.

148
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:43,180
Every complaint I read had something or other that went deliberately unanswered by the BBC.

149
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,120
And most common of these was, as I mentioned earlier, complaints about transphobia.

150
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,980
It's very clear that the BBC absolutely does not want to engage on any level with talk

151
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,580
about transphobia here.

152
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,060
If, for instance, you complain about the survey misgendering trans people, the BBC will respond

153
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,840
by talking about sample sizes and lack of other research and so on, as if you merely

154
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,560
made a dry academic complaint about survey quality.

155
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,060
They are deliberately missing the point, because they don't want to make a statement about

156
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,140
transphobia.

157
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,740
They don't want to say, yes, we think it's okay for us to platform groups that misgender

158
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,940
trans people, that call trans people rapists, that want to take away trans rights.

159
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,820
So with all that in mind, here's what I'm gonna do.

160
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,700
Firstly, I'm going to escalate my initial complaint about the lie about Chelsea Poe.

161
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,020
I'm gonna do that in the same way as the last complaint by going to the BBC complaints page

162
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,740
linked below, selecting BBC website or apps, BBC news website, I'm going to paste the link

163
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,500
to the article, but then when it says, are you contacting us about a previous complaint,

164
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,380
I'm going to say yes.

165
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,660
On the next page, I'm going to paste the reference code for the complaint I made and explain

166
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,360
as precisely as I can how their response was inadequate and failed to answer what I was

167
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,900
complaining about, as if they don't already know that.

168
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,620
Next, I'm going to submit a new complaint about this article, but before I get into

169
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,060
what I'm gonna say, a few points about the process here.

170
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,860
Firstly, we're going to be in this for the long haul, it looks like.

171
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,780
How this works is that you complain once, then once the BBC respond, you can escalate,

172
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,660
which is where we are now.

173
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,560
Then when they respond to that, you can escalate again.

174
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,040
And after their next response, if you're still not satisfied that they answered your complaint,

175
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,860
you can contact Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator.

176
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,660
Now there's obviously a delay between each of their responses, especially since they're

177
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,900
dealing with a higher volume of cases at the moment for some reason, so this is going

178
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,100
to take a while, I'm afraid.

179
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,860
Next up, the BBC only accepts initial complaints for 30 working days after material is published,

180
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,700
and 30 working days after the article in question was published is Monday.

181
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,460
So if you haven't submitted an initial complaint by Monday, you usually will not be able to

182
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,100
start the complaints process.

183
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,500
So if you have not complained thus far but would like to, or if you have already complained

184
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,020
but suddenly get the urge in the next five minutes to submit a new complaint as well,

185
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,580
I'd advise that you do that as soon as possible.

186
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,360
Also after the first complaint, you usually can't add any new information during the process.

187
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,260
They will only respond, or not respond as it is, to points made in the initial complaint.

188
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,700
So be aware of that.

189
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,240
Whatever you ultimately want answered here has to be in the initial message.

190
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,660
With that in mind, my new complaint is going to be specifically about the transphobia in

191
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,340
the Get the L Out survey.

192
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,340
I don't like the BBC refusing to address the transphobia.

193
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,900
I don't like them deliberately dodging questions about it by pretending to hear something else.

194
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:50,260
I want them to answer for this, for the bigotry, for the transphobia specifically and directly.

195
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,860
So I'm going to complain about the article linking to a survey which refuses to gender

196
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,140
trans people correctly, likens trans people to rapists, and so on.

197
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,100
But I'm also going to say that I have absolutely no issues whatsoever with the survey's sample

198
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,380
size, distribution method, or findings.

199
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,220
For the purposes of this complaint, I have zero issues with either this survey or the

200
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,980
article it's featured in, with the singular exception of the transphobic language in the

201
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
survey.

202
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,660
That is the sole issue I am concerned with and require a response for, the BBC, if you

203
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,460
would be so kind.

204
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,380
Now my aim here, of course, is to force them to make a statement specifically regarding

205
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,060
the transphobia and their promotion of it, and I'm starting out with a message that gives

206
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,380
them as few ways as possible to weasel out of answering me so that when this complaint

207
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,580
is escalated, hopefully they will have nowhere to hide.

208
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,740
I'm going to keep escalating my complaints and I would encourage very strongly anyone

209
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,800
who already feels like doing so, of course, to escalate their initial complaint or submit

210
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,120
one for the first time.

211
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,880
There is a link below.

212
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,640
And again, I'm not telling you what to do here, of course, but I did release this video

213
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,360
after work hours on a Friday, coincidentally, and I think it would be swell if the BBC turn

214
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,240
up for work on Monday with some things to consider in their inbox.

215
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Now, I do realize I'm getting a little Captain Ahab about all of this, and I apologize.

216
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,200
I will continue to make videos about other things.

217
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,880
We are not in for six months of me ranting at the BBC here.

218
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:36,040
Well, we are in for that, actually, it looks like, but I will try and do other stuff too,

219
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,640
I promise.
