0	1800	Hello, everyone.
1800	6980	This video is a follow-up to a recent video of mine about a dreadful transphobic article
6980	10060	published by the BBC on their website.
10060	14280	If you haven't seen that video, I'd encourage you to watch that one first to get caught
14280	15280	up.
15280	19280	It isn't very long, and I'll include a link to it below in the video description.
19280	22980	Right, so, welcome to round two.
22980	28080	Following on directly from that last video, the BBC have been sending out responses to
28080	30960	the various complaints people made about the article.
30960	35280	I posted on Twitter asking people to share with me the text of their complaints and also
35280	40220	the BBC response, which a very large number of people did, and I'd like to say thank
40220	43260	you very much to everyone who took the time to share that with me.
43260	44860	It was very useful.
44860	50960	So the BBC have so far been sending out two responses, both of which are predictably utterly
50960	52140	rubbish.
52140	56580	The first response is a general defence of the article, its aims, and in particular its
56580	61040	inclusion of the Get the L Out survey, and this appears to have been sent en masse in
61040	67280	response to a variety of different complaints, but in particular ones that focus on the survey.
67280	72100	The second response, which I and many others received, is a defence of the author of the
72100	75020	article choosing not to include Chelsea Poe.
75020	80020	Now this is inadequate because my complaint was not that the article did not include Chelsea
80020	84980	Poe, it was that the author of the article interviewed Chelsea Poe and then lied that
84980	86480	she did not.
86480	91640	So we're going to read these two responses, identify the places where the BBC is deliberately
91640	96380	missing the point, and then discuss how we're going to escalate this.
96380	100420	The first response opens by saying that they've received feedback from people who have found
100420	105260	the article challenging, as if it's some work of genius we just haven't comprehended
105260	109220	yet instead of vile discriminatory hate speech.
109220	113280	It then says that the article was carefully considered before publication and went through
113280	115820	an internal editorial review process.
115820	121380	Now this is not a defence of the article, it is a condemnation of their editorial review
121380	122600	process.
122600	128140	Do the BBC expect us to believe that this article was carefully reviewed before publication,
128140	133940	but that nobody noticed the multiple quotes from an enormous photograph of the rapist
133940	138980	in the middle of the article, who they later had to cut from the article?
138980	144140	Either the review process didn't catch Lily Cade's inclusion, or they didn't care,
144140	148860	either one of which means their review process is not fit for purpose.
148860	153700	The response then moves on to defend the inclusion of the Get The L Out survey, saying,
153700	157140	It's been argued by some people that the article is flawed because it's based on
157140	159060	a survey of 80 people.
159060	163300	However, the article itself states there is little research in this area, that the survey
163300	167980	featured was conducted on social media and is therefore self-selecting, and that even
167980	172180	the author of the survey admits it may not be a representative sample.
172180	174220	Now the issue with this is twofold.
174220	178900	Firstly, although it begins with the word however, the second sentence here does not
178900	180600	contradict the first.
180600	185980	The charge is that the survey is biased and flawed, and the BBC responses to say we know,
185980	187860	but we admitted that.
187860	190220	Now that's not an answer.
190220	194600	The fact that there is quote little research in this area doesn't give you a green light
194600	199420	to base your arguments on bad research, even if you admit it's bad.
199420	204700	There could be little research in this area because the area in question is a foundationless
204700	208180	moral panic invented by hate groups.
208180	213700	The other issue here is that the BBC is not mentioning the transphobia, the bigotry, the
213700	215940	discrimination in the survey.
215940	220160	It is pretending that all complaints about the survey have been because it is of strictly
220160	225900	poor academic quality, which it is, but that isn't the main problem with it.
225900	230700	The survey deliberately and repeatedly refuses to gender trans people correctly.
230700	236960	It approvingly includes the quote, all transsexuals rape women's bodies, and states in reference
236960	241220	to this quote that this analysis remains as relevant as ever.
241220	245760	So when the response goes on to say that furthermore, there is a link to the details of the findings
245760	249220	of the survey in the article, that's worse than not linking to it.
249220	250820	I hope you understand.
250820	253740	This open hate speech is linked in the article.
253740	256660	It's just a click away from the BBC website.
256660	262580	The rest of the response deals with impartiality, saying we have a strong commitment to impartiality,
262580	267780	which means we constantly consider and evaluate which stories to cover and how.
267780	273740	Impartiality is fundamental and includes covering stories on any point of the spectrum of debate.
273740	277660	Now this impartiality talk is quite revealing.
277660	282780	First off here, if we look at the BBC's editorial guidelines in the section Impartiality and
282820	288660	Racism, the first heading in that section reads in big bold letters, the BBC is not
288660	295380	impartial on racism and it calls opposition to racism a fundamental democratic principle.
295380	302260	So let's say a racist group in the UK, patriotic alternative we'll imagine, puts out a self
302260	308500	selecting survey of its social media followers and asks them their thoughts about immigrants.
308500	313980	And then let's say they pepper their findings with quotes referring to immigrants as rapists.
313980	318620	Would the BBC approvingly share and link to that survey?
318620	321180	No, it wouldn't.
321180	322820	Hopefully not anyway.
322820	328820	The BBC would say, this is obvious racist hate speech put out by a clearly biased group
328820	334740	clumsily dressed up as an academic study and we will not share it because the BBC is not
334740	337640	impartial on racism.
337640	340200	Racism is not to be debated.
340200	345200	When it comes to trans issues, however, the BBC has done the exact equivalent of the scenario
345200	346680	I just described.
346680	349280	They treat trans rights as a debate.
349280	355080	They are giving a platform to groups who want to take away rights that trans people already have.
355080	360600	In casting this as a debate with legitimate opposing sides, in declaring that trans rights
360600	366600	are something one can be impartial about, the BBC are making a political statement here,
366600	370280	regardless of any pretense of journalistic neutrality.
370280	375080	They're saying trans rights are up for debate and groups that want to discriminate against
375080	380480	trans people, that want to take rights away from trans people, they deserve access to
380480	382100	our platform.
382100	386360	But let's put a pin in that for now and move on to talk about the second response, the
386360	391120	one that deals with the author's lie about no high profile trans women wanting to talk
391120	392120	to her.
392120	393320	And this starts out...
422120	429120	Now, this is what the complaint was actually about, this particular lie.
429120	430560	The original article states...
438960	443860	So, high profile trans women who have either written or spoken about sex and relationships
443860	446560	is the definition we're concerned with here.
446600	452160	Now, Chelsea Poe is a trans woman, she was interviewed by the author of the article,
452160	456040	this is beyond dispute, the BBC have admitted to that.
456040	461500	Chelsea Poe has spoken about sex and relationships in various interviews in a range of different
461500	465000	media outlets, this is also beyond dispute.
465000	470000	The BBC's argument, therefore, hinges solely on the term high profile.
470000	471000	They say...
476840	482840	In a vacuum, okay, high profile is open to debate, but within the context of the article,
482840	484520	it is absolutely not.
484520	489640	Firstly, Chelsea Poe was high profile enough to be contacted and actually interviewed for
489640	491860	the article in the first place.
491860	496480	Why would they bother doing that if she then wasn't high profile enough to include in the
496480	497480	piece?
497480	499000	That doesn't make sense.
499000	503640	Secondly, the article includes examples of trans women who the author of the article
503640	505920	does feel are high profile.
505920	506920	It says...
516080	520920	Now, one of the people quoted here is a YouTuber with less than 10,000 subscribers, speaking
520920	525840	in a video posted seven years ago that's had about 10,000 views.
525840	531560	Now I'm not sub-count shaming here or anything, but if this source counts as high profile,
531560	537320	then Chelsea Poe must count as high profile, mathematically, because she has more than
537320	542440	double the amount of social media followers as the high profile source in the article.
542440	547320	It isn't numerically possible for this person to be high profile and Chelsea Poe not to
547320	548880	be high profile.
548880	552480	This argument is just pathetic from the BBC.
552480	557040	I can't physically put enough emphasis on the word pathetic here.
557040	564600	For them to be reduced to this childish, petulant shite to cover up a blatant, bigoted lie.
564600	569740	How ridiculous that they would even attempt this, and how shameful that they think it
569740	571200	would work.
571200	575640	The last line of the response basically says we can include whoever we want, screw you.
575640	577920	Which is the same irrelevant point as earlier.
577920	580000	That's not what the complaint was about.
580000	585680	Now then, we've looked at two responses there, and I don't know about you, but I'm not completely
585680	587080	satisfied here.
587080	589100	I don't know if you can tell.
589100	593080	And before I talk about what I'm going to do in response here, I'd like to note a few
593080	594080	things.
594080	598960	Firstly, some of the BBC responses were slow going out, because to quote an email they
598960	604120	sent about the delay, we're currently dealing with a higher than normal volume of cases.
604120	606060	So they were snowed under, basically.
606060	609520	They got too many complaints to deal with in the normal way.
609520	614380	Next, having read a lot of these complaints, I know that the BBC have thus far sent these
614380	619020	two responses out to basically every complaint they received, even in cases where they're
619020	620800	entirely inadequate.
620800	622820	I mean, they're always inadequate, but...
622820	627000	There are a lot of people out there who complained, for instance, about the inclusion of Lily
627000	632980	Cade, then the Get the L Out survey, and then the lie about Chelsea Poe, but who got a response
632980	637780	which only addressed the lie about Chelsea Poe and ignored the rest.
637780	643180	Every complaint I read had something or other that went deliberately unanswered by the BBC.
643180	648120	And most common of these was, as I mentioned earlier, complaints about transphobia.
648120	652980	It's very clear that the BBC absolutely does not want to engage on any level with talk
652980	654580	about transphobia here.
654580	660060	If, for instance, you complain about the survey misgendering trans people, the BBC will respond
660060	664840	by talking about sample sizes and lack of other research and so on, as if you merely
664840	668560	made a dry academic complaint about survey quality.
668560	673060	They are deliberately missing the point, because they don't want to make a statement about
673060	674140	transphobia.
674140	678740	They don't want to say, yes, we think it's okay for us to platform groups that misgender
678740	683940	trans people, that call trans people rapists, that want to take away trans rights.
683940	686820	So with all that in mind, here's what I'm gonna do.
686820	691700	Firstly, I'm going to escalate my initial complaint about the lie about Chelsea Poe.
691700	696020	I'm gonna do that in the same way as the last complaint by going to the BBC complaints page
696020	701740	linked below, selecting BBC website or apps, BBC news website, I'm going to paste the link
701740	706500	to the article, but then when it says, are you contacting us about a previous complaint,
706500	708380	I'm going to say yes.
708380	712660	On the next page, I'm going to paste the reference code for the complaint I made and explain
712660	717360	as precisely as I can how their response was inadequate and failed to answer what I was
717360	720900	complaining about, as if they don't already know that.
720900	725620	Next, I'm going to submit a new complaint about this article, but before I get into
725620	729060	what I'm gonna say, a few points about the process here.
729100	732860	Firstly, we're going to be in this for the long haul, it looks like.
732860	737780	How this works is that you complain once, then once the BBC respond, you can escalate,
737780	739660	which is where we are now.
739660	742560	Then when they respond to that, you can escalate again.
742560	747040	And after their next response, if you're still not satisfied that they answered your complaint,
747040	750860	you can contact Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator.
750860	754660	Now there's obviously a delay between each of their responses, especially since they're
754660	759900	dealing with a higher volume of cases at the moment for some reason, so this is going
759900	762100	to take a while, I'm afraid.
762100	767860	Next up, the BBC only accepts initial complaints for 30 working days after material is published,
767860	772700	and 30 working days after the article in question was published is Monday.
772700	777460	So if you haven't submitted an initial complaint by Monday, you usually will not be able to
777460	779100	start the complaints process.
779100	783500	So if you have not complained thus far but would like to, or if you have already complained
783500	788020	but suddenly get the urge in the next five minutes to submit a new complaint as well,
788020	790580	I'd advise that you do that as soon as possible.
790580	795360	Also after the first complaint, you usually can't add any new information during the process.
795360	801260	They will only respond, or not respond as it is, to points made in the initial complaint.
801260	802700	So be aware of that.
802700	807240	Whatever you ultimately want answered here has to be in the initial message.
807240	811660	With that in mind, my new complaint is going to be specifically about the transphobia in
811660	813340	the Get the L Out survey.
813340	817340	I don't like the BBC refusing to address the transphobia.
817340	822900	I don't like them deliberately dodging questions about it by pretending to hear something else.
822900	830260	I want them to answer for this, for the bigotry, for the transphobia specifically and directly.
830260	834860	So I'm going to complain about the article linking to a survey which refuses to gender
834860	839140	trans people correctly, likens trans people to rapists, and so on.
839140	845100	But I'm also going to say that I have absolutely no issues whatsoever with the survey's sample
845100	848380	size, distribution method, or findings.
848380	853220	For the purposes of this complaint, I have zero issues with either this survey or the
853220	857980	article it's featured in, with the singular exception of the transphobic language in the
857980	858980	survey.
858980	865660	That is the sole issue I am concerned with and require a response for, the BBC, if you
865660	867460	would be so kind.
867460	872380	Now my aim here, of course, is to force them to make a statement specifically regarding
872380	877060	the transphobia and their promotion of it, and I'm starting out with a message that gives
877060	882380	them as few ways as possible to weasel out of answering me so that when this complaint
882380	886580	is escalated, hopefully they will have nowhere to hide.
886580	891740	I'm going to keep escalating my complaints and I would encourage very strongly anyone
891740	896800	who already feels like doing so, of course, to escalate their initial complaint or submit
896800	898120	one for the first time.
898120	899880	There is a link below.
899880	904640	And again, I'm not telling you what to do here, of course, but I did release this video
904640	910360	after work hours on a Friday, coincidentally, and I think it would be swell if the BBC turn
910360	915240	up for work on Monday with some things to consider in their inbox.
915240	922240	Now, I do realize I'm getting a little Captain Ahab about all of this, and I apologize.
922240	925200	I will continue to make videos about other things.
925200	929880	We are not in for six months of me ranting at the BBC here.
929880	936040	Well, we are in for that, actually, it looks like, but I will try and do other stuff too,
936040	936640	I promise.
