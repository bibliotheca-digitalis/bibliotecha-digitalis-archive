00:00.000 --> 00:01.440
Hello, everyone.

00:01.440 --> 00:09.160
Today, I'm going to talk about a truly disgusting article that was posted on the BBC News website on the 26th of October.

00:09.160 --> 00:09.960
That being,

00:09.960 --> 00:15.240
We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Trans Women, written by Carolyn Lowbridge.

00:15.240 --> 00:21.040
Now, hateful transphobic bigotry is very much the norm throughout most of the British news media,

00:21.040 --> 00:25.680
but for various reasons, this article stands out as especially repulsive.

00:25.920 --> 00:32.000
This article attempts to make the case that cis lesbians are being sexually assaulted by predatory trans women

00:32.000 --> 00:35.480
on a level that goes beyond the actions of individuals.

00:35.480 --> 00:42.080
Cis lesbians, as a group, are in danger from trans women, is the point this article is trying to make.

00:42.080 --> 00:46.160
Now, of course, a member of any group of people can pressure or coerce someone into sex,

00:46.160 --> 00:50.400
but we cannot use that fact to tar the whole group with the same brush.

00:50.400 --> 00:55.160
Using the actions of an individual to discriminate against an entire group is...

00:55.160 --> 00:57.200
Well, it's discrimination, isn't it?

00:57.200 --> 00:59.240
The BBC could just as well print,

00:59.240 --> 01:02.680
We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Cis Lesbians,

01:02.680 --> 01:07.600
and use isolated incidents of people being sexually assaulted by cis lesbians

01:07.600 --> 01:11.600
to make the case that the lesbian community is inherently dangerous.

01:11.600 --> 01:18.120
Now, that would be ridiculous, homophobic discrimination, and exactly as valid as this article.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.360
The BBC would not write the articles,

01:20.360 --> 01:23.360
We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Black Men,

01:23.400 --> 01:26.680
or We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Jews,

01:26.680 --> 01:30.240
but it can get away with writing the exact same thing about trans women

01:30.240 --> 01:33.400
because of the media environment into which it's being released,

01:33.400 --> 01:36.040
which is an openly transphobic one.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.760
So I disagree with this article in conception.

01:38.760 --> 01:42.120
I think it is a textbook case of bigoted discrimination,

01:42.120 --> 01:44.840
but it gets much worse, trust me.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.120
Now, for an article with this title,

01:47.120 --> 01:52.720
you might expect it would mainly be concerned with people being pressured into sex by trans women,

01:52.720 --> 01:58.160
but the article contains only two reported instances of trans women pressuring someone into sex.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.600
It's actually much more concerned with hypothetical scenarios,

02:01.600 --> 02:05.000
or with differences of opinion within the LGBT community

02:05.000 --> 02:09.640
that have nothing whatsoever to do with trans women pressuring people into sex.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.240
For instance, it tells the story of a cis lesbian

02:12.240 --> 02:15.640
whose girlfriend wanted them to have a threesome with a trans woman,

02:15.640 --> 02:18.920
but she didn't want to, and they had an argument about that.

02:18.920 --> 02:22.240
Now, no trans woman is pressuring anyone here.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.920
They're not even involved in the story directly.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.920
This is something going on between two cis women.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.200
This story has no business being alongside someone saying

02:31.200 --> 02:35.760
I was actually pressured into sex as if those two things were equivalent.

02:35.760 --> 02:40.880
Now, in an attempt to prove that trans women pressuring people into sex is an actual phenomenon

02:40.880 --> 02:43.760
and not just a number of isolated incidents,

02:43.760 --> 02:46.000
the same as we would expect of any group,

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
the article cites a questionnaire distributed by the fringe transphobic hate group Get The L Out,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.360
which reported that of the 80 women who did respond,

02:55.360 --> 03:01.760
56% reported being pressured or coerced to accept a trans woman as a sexual partner.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.720
Now, there are lots of problems with this questionnaire.

03:04.720 --> 03:11.440
Firstly, it specifically refuses to gender trans women correctly using he and him throughout.

03:11.440 --> 03:16.480
Given that, and the fact that Get The L Out distributed this study via social media,

03:16.480 --> 03:19.280
gives rise to obvious bias issues,

03:19.280 --> 03:25.840
specifically in terms of who would respond to this clearly biased hateful propaganda in the first place.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.480
But a bigger issue is what the questionnaire considers to be pressure or coercion.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.320
In the section of the findings, which reports the 56% figure,

03:34.320 --> 03:40.720
it states most respondents reported being subjected to such rhetoric directly or indirectly

03:40.720 --> 03:44.960
with the general feeling that it's online everywhere and relentless.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.680
Now, this is not trans women pressuring people into sex.

03:49.680 --> 03:55.680
This is some transphobes seeing trans acceptance on the internet and not liking that.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.720
They don't think that trans women are women,

03:58.720 --> 04:02.240
so when they see people online treating trans women as women,

04:02.240 --> 04:06.000
they take that as a personal attack, but it isn't.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.080
And we see a similar attitude in the section titled Deception.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.840
Several respondents discussed their experiences of deception

04:13.840 --> 04:17.280
while being approached by trans women they assumed to be women.

04:17.280 --> 04:20.320
They reported feeling betrayed and violated.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.800
So just trans women passing is being classed as deception here.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.640
They're taking it personally.

04:26.640 --> 04:31.680
They're acting like, by itself, a trans woman passing is an attack upon them.

04:31.680 --> 04:37.680
What is being included as pressure or coercion here is simply trans women existing.

04:37.680 --> 04:42.240
And we see a very clear indication of this when the questionnaire shares that awful quote

04:42.240 --> 04:47.760
by Janice Raymond comparing trans people's existence at all to the act of rape.

04:48.320 --> 04:52.560
And it is incredibly unfair to actual survivors of sexual assault

04:52.560 --> 04:56.240
to have their experiences categorized alongside things like

04:56.240 --> 04:58.640
I didn't realize someone was trans,

04:58.640 --> 05:02.160
or not enough people are being transphobic on the internet,

05:02.160 --> 05:05.360
or simply just trans people exist.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.360
This is just hate speech very shoddily dressed up as a study,

05:09.360 --> 05:14.800
and it is utterly embarrassing that the BBC shared this as if it was legitimate.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.080
But to be clear here,

05:16.080 --> 05:21.200
even though this rubbish is clearly discriminatory and put out by an obviously biased group

05:21.200 --> 05:26.240
and pads what we can mockingly call its findings with utter irrelevancies,

05:26.240 --> 05:29.520
I am absolutely not casting doubt on any of the respondents

05:29.520 --> 05:32.320
who reported actual sexual harassment or coercion.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.880
All I will say is that, firstly, we cannot use their individual experiences

05:36.880 --> 05:39.360
to discriminate against an entire group of people.

05:39.360 --> 05:44.240
And secondly, nobody at the BBC responsible for sharing the findings of this study

05:44.240 --> 05:47.600
cares at all about women being sexually assaulted.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.760
Carolyn Lowbridge does not care about women being sexually assaulted,

05:51.760 --> 05:54.880
except for how she can use that to attack trans people.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.440
And this is not something I say lightly.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.440
There is absolute proof here.

05:59.440 --> 06:03.120
You see, this article featured prominently as a source Lily Cade,

06:03.120 --> 06:05.200
an adult film performer who, quote,

06:11.200 --> 06:15.280
Now, I dislike the very gatekeep-y gold star lesbian phrase there,

06:15.280 --> 06:19.120
but leaving that aside, Cade gets quoted several times in the article,

06:19.120 --> 06:22.480
and there's also a big picture of her posing for the cameras there.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.760
So, trusted BBC source Lily Cade here,

06:25.760 --> 06:29.840
giving her thoughts about trans women pressuring people into sex.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.360
Now, there's an issue with this,

06:31.360 --> 06:35.520
and that is Lily Cade is someone who is accused of, and has admitted to,

06:35.520 --> 06:38.000
a series of sexual assaults.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.400
Multiple people in the industry Lily Cade worked in

06:40.400 --> 06:42.720
reported that she sexually assaulted them,

06:42.720 --> 06:46.480
and this is something that was known about long before this article came out.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.880
So, what is Lily Cade doing here,

06:48.880 --> 06:52.080
being given a platform by the BBC to share her thoughts

06:52.080 --> 06:54.960
in an article about women being pressured into sex?

06:54.960 --> 06:57.840
If the BBC cared about women being pressured into sex,

06:57.840 --> 07:02.640
why not mention that their source has a history of sexually assaulting women?

07:02.640 --> 07:05.200
So, we can say, maybe they didn't know.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.840
Maybe Carolyn Lowbridge, when writing this article,

07:07.840 --> 07:11.360
didn't bother to Google the names of the people she was talking to,

07:11.360 --> 07:15.440
or maybe just nobody informed her of the allegations against Lily Cade.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.360
Except, that's not true, and we can prove it.

07:19.360 --> 07:23.360
And to do so, we first need to correct an outright lie in the article.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.520
So, in the section of the article titled,

07:25.520 --> 07:26.800
Who else was approached?

07:26.800 --> 07:28.480
Carolyn Lowbridge writes,

07:42.400 --> 07:44.400
Now, this is not true.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.440
So, Chelsea Poe is a high-profile trans woman

07:47.440 --> 07:50.640
who has spoken extensively about sex and relationships,

07:50.640 --> 07:55.200
being interviewed in the Huffington Post, Glamour, Slate, and so on.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.560
Chelsea Poe claims that she was interviewed by Carolyn Lowbridge

07:58.560 --> 08:02.160
for the BBC article, but that her contribution was cut.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.400
She also claims that she informed the BBC

08:04.400 --> 08:07.200
about the sexual assaults carried out by Lily Cade,

08:07.200 --> 08:10.320
but that, to quote a Pink News article about this incident,

08:10.320 --> 08:13.840
there was not much of a reaction from the journalist.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.080
Now, we know that this interview took place.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.720
Chelsea Poe tweeted about talking to the BBC

08:18.720 --> 08:21.840
and Carolyn Lowbridge in September of last year,

08:21.840 --> 08:24.400
and the BBC itself confirmed to Pink News

08:24.400 --> 08:26.000
that Lowbridge interviewed Poe,

08:26.000 --> 08:26.720
but that, quote,

08:41.200 --> 08:43.600
Now, firstly here, the BBC has been caught

08:43.600 --> 08:45.920
in an outright falsehood, obviously.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.360
The article states, today, it still says this,

08:49.360 --> 08:53.600
that no high-profile trans women wanted to talk to Carolyn Lowbridge,

08:53.600 --> 08:56.160
while neglecting to mention that they did.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.880
They were interviewed, and then she cut them.

08:58.880 --> 09:02.000
And now she's pretending that nobody wanted to talk to her,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.240
that she couldn't find a willing participant

09:04.240 --> 09:05.680
to give an alternate viewpoint.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.080
And this is just lying.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.400
Just open lying.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.120
Secondly, this article is purportedly about women

09:13.120 --> 09:14.480
feeling pressured into sex,

09:14.480 --> 09:17.040
and you were told one of your main sources

09:17.040 --> 09:20.160
is someone who repeatedly sexually assaulted women.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.880
How could that not be relevant?

09:23.600 --> 09:25.680
It couldn't be more relevant.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.200
It seems obvious to say,

09:27.200 --> 09:31.520
but if Carolyn Lowbridge or anyone at the BBC responsible for this article

09:31.520 --> 09:34.480
cared at all about women being sexually assaulted,

09:34.480 --> 09:36.720
they never would have given a platform

09:36.720 --> 09:41.840
to someone who they knew they were told sexually assaulted women.

09:41.840 --> 09:45.840
The only problem for them here is that Lily Cade isn't trans.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.360
Her sexual assaults can't be weaponized to attack trans people,

09:49.360 --> 09:52.000
so her sexual assaults don't count.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.360
They're not relevant.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.280
Lily Cade's actions speak only to hair behavior for some reason,

09:57.280 --> 09:59.520
and not any group she belongs to.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.520
Lily Cade is afforded the dignity

10:01.520 --> 10:04.720
of being considered responsible for her own actions,

10:04.720 --> 10:07.840
not like those trans women who must be judged as a group

10:07.840 --> 10:09.920
for the actions of individuals.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.560
And of course, there is the additional indignity done

10:12.560 --> 10:16.160
to the anonymous survivors of sexual assault quoted in the article

10:16.160 --> 10:19.280
who were made to share a platform alongside someone

10:19.280 --> 10:21.440
who sexually assaulted women.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.080
Now, it might be hard to believe this,

10:24.080 --> 10:26.160
but this story gets even worse.

10:26.160 --> 10:30.080
You see, Lily Cade used the spotlight given to her by the BBC.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.360
She used the attention this article generated for her

10:33.360 --> 10:36.720
to publish a deranged genocidal manifesto,

10:37.440 --> 10:41.280
seriously, calling for the murder of all trans women,

10:41.280 --> 10:43.840
which included naming specific trans women

10:43.840 --> 10:46.160
she wanted to personally quote,

10:46.160 --> 10:47.040
Lynch.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.720
And perhaps most pertinent for the topic at hand today,

10:50.720 --> 10:53.280
Lily Cade didn't just make death threats,

10:53.280 --> 10:57.840
but also rape threats against the families of trans people.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.960
Now, after several days of trying to ignore that this happened,

11:00.960 --> 11:02.800
the BBC caved to pressure

11:02.800 --> 11:06.240
and removed Lily Cade's contribution from the article.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.680
And the editorial note they included with the article reads as follows,

11:09.680 --> 11:12.000
We have updated this article published last week

11:12.000 --> 11:14.480
to remove a contribution from one individual

11:14.480 --> 11:18.640
in light of comments she has published on blog posts in recent days,

11:18.640 --> 11:20.160
which we have been able to verify.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.680
We acknowledge that an admission of inappropriate behavior

11:23.680 --> 11:27.200
by the same contributor should have been included in the original article.

11:27.920 --> 11:31.600
So firstly, note the lack of apology for platforming a rapist

11:31.600 --> 11:34.480
who writes serial killer manifestos.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.840
But also, what's with the euphemisms here

11:37.840 --> 11:40.160
in light of comments she published?

11:40.160 --> 11:43.520
I guess that's what we're calling explicit death threats now.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.600
Comments and inappropriate behavior.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.200
Now, the article itself uses terms like rape and sexual assault

11:51.200 --> 11:53.360
when attributing those things to trans women,

11:53.360 --> 11:57.520
so why did they only talk about what Lily Cade did euphemistically?

11:57.520 --> 12:01.920
And an admission of inappropriate behavior should have been included?

12:01.920 --> 12:04.640
Apparently it would have been fine to platform Lily Cade

12:04.640 --> 12:07.360
if only they'd included an admission of their quote,

12:07.360 --> 12:08.880
inappropriate behavior.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.720
And how would that work?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.640
What would they have said, even?

12:12.640 --> 12:14.960
Lily Cade, admitted rapist,

12:14.960 --> 12:18.000
has some concerns about women being pressured into sex.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.680
What sense would that make?

12:19.680 --> 12:23.680
No, including Cade at all was wrong, the BBC.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.160
You do not get to weasel out of this.

12:26.160 --> 12:31.280
You must and will take this article down and give a full apology for it.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.200
Not just for platforming Lily Cade,

12:33.200 --> 12:36.240
but for the outright lies, the terrible research,

12:36.240 --> 12:38.640
and the disgusting, bigoted premise.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.400
Now, you might notice that I'm a little annoyed about this,

12:42.400 --> 12:44.480
and I admit it, I am. This is awful.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.760
BBC is supposed to be better than this.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.840
It isn't, clearly, but it's supposed to be.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.160
This article will be deleted and apologized for eventually,

12:56.160 --> 12:59.440
depending on how stubborn the BBC wants to be about it,

12:59.440 --> 13:02.000
which at the moment is very stubborn.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.160
But before it is deleted, I feel compelled to speak up about it.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.560
I don't like that this is happening in the BBC.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.040
I don't like that this is happening in my country.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.600
And I want to be able to say in the future

13:13.600 --> 13:16.480
that I said something about it at the time.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.600
So what I'm gonna do, in addition to making this video,

13:19.600 --> 13:22.080
is submit a complaint to the BBC.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.720
And I would encourage you to also make a complaint,

13:24.720 --> 13:27.760
only if you feel compelled to do so, of course.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.240
And we can do it together right now, actually.

13:30.240 --> 13:34.400
So the BBC is a worldwide service, and they accept complaints from anywhere.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.640
So don't worry if you're outside the UK.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.840
I'll include a link in the video description to the complaints page,

13:39.840 --> 13:41.280
which looks like this.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.920
And then I'm gonna click the make a complaint button there,

13:43.920 --> 13:46.000
which takes us to this page.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.800
From the drop-down menu under what is your complaint about,

13:48.800 --> 13:51.920
I'm going to select BBC website or apps,

13:51.920 --> 13:54.080
and then BBC news website.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.600
When it asks for the URL,

13:55.600 --> 13:58.640
I'm gonna paste the URL of the awful news article,

13:58.640 --> 14:00.160
which I'll include below.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.040
Then are you contacting us about a previous complaint?

14:03.040 --> 14:04.720
No, and continue.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.520
So select the best category to describe your complaint.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.840
And honestly, it could be anything here.

14:09.920 --> 14:13.840
Bias, factual error, offense, poor quality.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.200
But I'm gonna select factual error or inaccuracy here.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.880
You see, my gut is telling me to focus on the one particular lie

14:20.880 --> 14:25.040
about no prominent trans women wanting to talk to the author of the article.

14:25.040 --> 14:29.040
It is an obvious falsehood, it is very easy to express,

14:29.040 --> 14:31.200
and it's impossible to refute.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.640
The BBC cannot respond honestly here in any way,

14:34.640 --> 14:38.720
except to further amend the article to remove this lie.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.800
Anything else they say in response will make them look even more biased.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.760
I will include the text of my complaint in the video description,

14:45.760 --> 14:49.280
but would encourage you to, only if you feel like it, of course,

14:49.280 --> 14:53.520
complain about any or all of the various problems with the article.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.000
And maybe you could share your complaints in the comments

14:56.000 --> 14:59.360
to perhaps inspire people in forming their own complaints.

14:59.360 --> 15:02.720
I'm also going to select that I do want a response to my complaints,

15:02.720 --> 15:05.520
because I want to see what they say in their defense here.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.480
Now, before I go today, I just want to address one response

15:08.480 --> 15:10.000
that I know this video will get.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.840
You see, the article qualifies its criticism of trans women

15:13.840 --> 15:18.960
by saying, some trans women, a minority of trans women, and so on.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.760
So they can't be being biased because they're saying

15:21.760 --> 15:26.240
it's a problem specific to some trans women, not all trans women.

15:26.240 --> 15:30.480
This is a cowardly tactic intended to provide cover for the BBC

15:30.480 --> 15:33.760
while it shares the messages of anti-trans hate groups.

15:33.760 --> 15:38.320
The BBC is being biased, regardless of these cowardly qualifiers.

15:38.320 --> 15:44.240
As we've seen today, some cis lesbians, like Lily Cade, pressure people into sex.

15:44.240 --> 15:48.080
But the BBC are not writing that article, are they?

15:48.080 --> 15:51.680
Of course, if Lily Cade was trans, she would be featured prominently here

15:51.680 --> 15:54.160
as one of the trans women pressuring people into sex.

15:54.160 --> 15:59.200
But because she isn't trans, Lily Cade gets quietly cut from the story.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.520
So I don't buy these qualifiers.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.680
I don't think they're meant honestly.

16:03.680 --> 16:07.200
If they were meant honestly, then this article wouldn't exist.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.760
Anyway, that's all from me today, folks.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.120
I'll see you next time.
