00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:09,160
Today, I'm going to talk about a truly disgusting article that was posted on the BBC News website on the 26th of October.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,960
That being,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,240
We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Trans Women, written by Carolyn Lowbridge.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,040
Now, hateful transphobic bigotry is very much the norm throughout most of the British news media,

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,680
but for various reasons, this article stands out as especially repulsive.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,000
This article attempts to make the case that cis lesbians are being sexually assaulted by predatory trans women

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,480
on a level that goes beyond the actions of individuals.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,080
Cis lesbians, as a group, are in danger from trans women, is the point this article is trying to make.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,160
Now, of course, a member of any group of people can pressure or coerce someone into sex,

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,400
but we cannot use that fact to tar the whole group with the same brush.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,160
Using the actions of an individual to discriminate against an entire group is...

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,200
Well, it's discrimination, isn't it?

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,240
The BBC could just as well print,

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,680
We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Cis Lesbians,

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,600
and use isolated incidents of people being sexually assaulted by cis lesbians

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,600
to make the case that the lesbian community is inherently dangerous.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,120
Now, that would be ridiculous, homophobic discrimination, and exactly as valid as this article.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,360
The BBC would not write the articles,

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,360
We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Black Men,

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,680
or We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Jews,

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,240
but it can get away with writing the exact same thing about trans women

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,400
because of the media environment into which it's being released,

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,040
which is an openly transphobic one.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,760
So I disagree with this article in conception.

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,120
I think it is a textbook case of bigoted discrimination,

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,840
but it gets much worse, trust me.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,120
Now, for an article with this title,

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,720
you might expect it would mainly be concerned with people being pressured into sex by trans women,

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,160
but the article contains only two reported instances of trans women pressuring someone into sex.

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,600
It's actually much more concerned with hypothetical scenarios,

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,000
or with differences of opinion within the LGBT community

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,640
that have nothing whatsoever to do with trans women pressuring people into sex.

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,240
For instance, it tells the story of a cis lesbian

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,640
whose girlfriend wanted them to have a threesome with a trans woman,

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,920
but she didn't want to, and they had an argument about that.

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,240
Now, no trans woman is pressuring anyone here.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,920
They're not even involved in the story directly.

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,920
This is something going on between two cis women.

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,200
This story has no business being alongside someone saying

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,760
I was actually pressured into sex as if those two things were equivalent.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,880
Now, in an attempt to prove that trans women pressuring people into sex is an actual phenomenon

43
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,760
and not just a number of isolated incidents,

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
the same as we would expect of any group,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the article cites a questionnaire distributed by the fringe transphobic hate group Get The L Out,

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
which reported that of the 80 women who did respond,

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,760
56% reported being pressured or coerced to accept a trans woman as a sexual partner.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,720
Now, there are lots of problems with this questionnaire.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,440
Firstly, it specifically refuses to gender trans women correctly using he and him throughout.

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,480
Given that, and the fact that Get The L Out distributed this study via social media,

51
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,280
gives rise to obvious bias issues,

52
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,840
specifically in terms of who would respond to this clearly biased hateful propaganda in the first place.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,480
But a bigger issue is what the questionnaire considers to be pressure or coercion.

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,320
In the section of the findings, which reports the 56% figure,

55
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,720
it states most respondents reported being subjected to such rhetoric directly or indirectly

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,960
with the general feeling that it's online everywhere and relentless.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,680
Now, this is not trans women pressuring people into sex.

58
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,680
This is some transphobes seeing trans acceptance on the internet and not liking that.

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,720
They don't think that trans women are women,

60
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,240
so when they see people online treating trans women as women,

61
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,000
they take that as a personal attack, but it isn't.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
And we see a similar attitude in the section titled Deception.

63
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Several respondents discussed their experiences of deception

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,280
while being approached by trans women they assumed to be women.

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,320
They reported feeling betrayed and violated.

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,800
So just trans women passing is being classed as deception here.

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,640
They're taking it personally.

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,680
They're acting like, by itself, a trans woman passing is an attack upon them.

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,680
What is being included as pressure or coercion here is simply trans women existing.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,240
And we see a very clear indication of this when the questionnaire shares that awful quote

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,760
by Janice Raymond comparing trans people's existence at all to the act of rape.

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,560
And it is incredibly unfair to actual survivors of sexual assault

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,240
to have their experiences categorized alongside things like

74
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,640
I didn't realize someone was trans,

75
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,160
or not enough people are being transphobic on the internet,

76
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,360
or simply just trans people exist.

77
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
This is just hate speech very shoddily dressed up as a study,

78
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,800
and it is utterly embarrassing that the BBC shared this as if it was legitimate.

79
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,080
But to be clear here,

80
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,200
even though this rubbish is clearly discriminatory and put out by an obviously biased group

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,240
and pads what we can mockingly call its findings with utter irrelevancies,

82
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,520
I am absolutely not casting doubt on any of the respondents

83
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,320
who reported actual sexual harassment or coercion.

84
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,880
All I will say is that, firstly, we cannot use their individual experiences

85
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,360
to discriminate against an entire group of people.

86
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,240
And secondly, nobody at the BBC responsible for sharing the findings of this study

87
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,600
cares at all about women being sexually assaulted.

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,760
Carolyn Lowbridge does not care about women being sexually assaulted,

89
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,880
except for how she can use that to attack trans people.

90
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,440
And this is not something I say lightly.

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
There is absolute proof here.

92
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,120
You see, this article featured prominently as a source Lily Cade,

93
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,200
an adult film performer who, quote,

94
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,280
Now, I dislike the very gatekeep-y gold star lesbian phrase there,

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,120
but leaving that aside, Cade gets quoted several times in the article,

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,480
and there's also a big picture of her posing for the cameras there.

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,760
So, trusted BBC source Lily Cade here,

98
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,840
giving her thoughts about trans women pressuring people into sex.

99
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,360
Now, there's an issue with this,

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,520
and that is Lily Cade is someone who is accused of, and has admitted to,

101
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,000
a series of sexual assaults.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
Multiple people in the industry Lily Cade worked in

103
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
reported that she sexually assaulted them,

104
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,480
and this is something that was known about long before this article came out.

105
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,880
So, what is Lily Cade doing here,

106
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,080
being given a platform by the BBC to share her thoughts

107
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
in an article about women being pressured into sex?

108
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,840
If the BBC cared about women being pressured into sex,

109
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,640
why not mention that their source has a history of sexually assaulting women?

110
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,200
So, we can say, maybe they didn't know.

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,840
Maybe Carolyn Lowbridge, when writing this article,

112
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,360
didn't bother to Google the names of the people she was talking to,

113
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,440
or maybe just nobody informed her of the allegations against Lily Cade.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,360
Except, that's not true, and we can prove it.

115
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
And to do so, we first need to correct an outright lie in the article.

116
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
So, in the section of the article titled,

117
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,800
Who else was approached?

118
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,480
Carolyn Lowbridge writes,

119
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Now, this is not true.

120
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,440
So, Chelsea Poe is a high-profile trans woman

121
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,640
who has spoken extensively about sex and relationships,

122
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,200
being interviewed in the Huffington Post, Glamour, Slate, and so on.

123
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,560
Chelsea Poe claims that she was interviewed by Carolyn Lowbridge

124
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,160
for the BBC article, but that her contribution was cut.

125
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
She also claims that she informed the BBC

126
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,200
about the sexual assaults carried out by Lily Cade,

127
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,320
but that, to quote a Pink News article about this incident,

128
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,840
there was not much of a reaction from the journalist.

129
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,080
Now, we know that this interview took place.

130
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,720
Chelsea Poe tweeted about talking to the BBC

131
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
and Carolyn Lowbridge in September of last year,

132
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
and the BBC itself confirmed to Pink News

133
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
that Lowbridge interviewed Poe,

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,720
but that, quote,

135
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,600
Now, firstly here, the BBC has been caught

136
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,920
in an outright falsehood, obviously.

137
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,360
The article states, today, it still says this,

138
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,600
that no high-profile trans women wanted to talk to Carolyn Lowbridge,

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
while neglecting to mention that they did.

140
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,880
They were interviewed, and then she cut them.

141
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,000
And now she's pretending that nobody wanted to talk to her,

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,240
that she couldn't find a willing participant

143
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
to give an alternate viewpoint.

144
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
And this is just lying.

145
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,400
Just open lying.

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,120
Secondly, this article is purportedly about women

147
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,480
feeling pressured into sex,

148
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,040
and you were told one of your main sources

149
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,160
is someone who repeatedly sexually assaulted women.

150
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,880
How could that not be relevant?

151
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,680
It couldn't be more relevant.

152
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,200
It seems obvious to say,

153
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,520
but if Carolyn Lowbridge or anyone at the BBC responsible for this article

154
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,480
cared at all about women being sexually assaulted,

155
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,720
they never would have given a platform

156
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,840
to someone who they knew they were told sexually assaulted women.

157
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,840
The only problem for them here is that Lily Cade isn't trans.

158
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,360
Her sexual assaults can't be weaponized to attack trans people,

159
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,000
so her sexual assaults don't count.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,360
They're not relevant.

161
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,280
Lily Cade's actions speak only to hair behavior for some reason,

162
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,520
and not any group she belongs to.

163
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Lily Cade is afforded the dignity

164
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,720
of being considered responsible for her own actions,

165
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,840
not like those trans women who must be judged as a group

166
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,920
for the actions of individuals.

167
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
And of course, there is the additional indignity done

168
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,160
to the anonymous survivors of sexual assault quoted in the article

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,280
who were made to share a platform alongside someone

170
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,440
who sexually assaulted women.

171
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,080
Now, it might be hard to believe this,

172
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,160
but this story gets even worse.

173
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,080
You see, Lily Cade used the spotlight given to her by the BBC.

174
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,360
She used the attention this article generated for her

175
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,720
to publish a deranged genocidal manifesto,

176
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,280
seriously, calling for the murder of all trans women,

177
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,840
which included naming specific trans women

178
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,160
she wanted to personally quote,

179
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,040
Lynch.

180
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,720
And perhaps most pertinent for the topic at hand today,

181
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,280
Lily Cade didn't just make death threats,

182
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,840
but also rape threats against the families of trans people.

183
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,960
Now, after several days of trying to ignore that this happened,

184
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,800
the BBC caved to pressure

185
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
and removed Lily Cade's contribution from the article.

186
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,680
And the editorial note they included with the article reads as follows,

187
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
We have updated this article published last week

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,480
to remove a contribution from one individual

189
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,640
in light of comments she has published on blog posts in recent days,

190
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,160
which we have been able to verify.

191
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
We acknowledge that an admission of inappropriate behavior

192
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,200
by the same contributor should have been included in the original article.

193
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,600
So firstly, note the lack of apology for platforming a rapist

194
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
who writes serial killer manifestos.

195
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,840
But also, what's with the euphemisms here

196
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,160
in light of comments she published?

197
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,520
I guess that's what we're calling explicit death threats now.

198
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,600
Comments and inappropriate behavior.

199
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
Now, the article itself uses terms like rape and sexual assault

200
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
when attributing those things to trans women,

201
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,520
so why did they only talk about what Lily Cade did euphemistically?

202
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,920
And an admission of inappropriate behavior should have been included?

203
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,640
Apparently it would have been fine to platform Lily Cade

204
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,360
if only they'd included an admission of their quote,

205
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
inappropriate behavior.

206
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
And how would that work?

207
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,640
What would they have said, even?

208
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,960
Lily Cade, admitted rapist,

209
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,000
has some concerns about women being pressured into sex.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
What sense would that make?

211
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,680
No, including Cade at all was wrong, the BBC.

212
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,160
You do not get to weasel out of this.

213
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,280
You must and will take this article down and give a full apology for it.

214
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,200
Not just for platforming Lily Cade,

215
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,240
but for the outright lies, the terrible research,

216
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,640
and the disgusting, bigoted premise.

217
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,400
Now, you might notice that I'm a little annoyed about this,

218
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,480
and I admit it, I am. This is awful.

219
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,760
BBC is supposed to be better than this.

220
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,840
It isn't, clearly, but it's supposed to be.

221
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,160
This article will be deleted and apologized for eventually,

222
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,440
depending on how stubborn the BBC wants to be about it,

223
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
which at the moment is very stubborn.

224
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,160
But before it is deleted, I feel compelled to speak up about it.

225
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,560
I don't like that this is happening in the BBC.

226
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,040
I don't like that this is happening in my country.

227
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,600
And I want to be able to say in the future

228
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,480
that I said something about it at the time.

229
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,600
So what I'm gonna do, in addition to making this video,

230
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,080
is submit a complaint to the BBC.

231
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,720
And I would encourage you to also make a complaint,

232
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,760
only if you feel compelled to do so, of course.

233
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,240
And we can do it together right now, actually.

234
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,400
So the BBC is a worldwide service, and they accept complaints from anywhere.

235
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,640
So don't worry if you're outside the UK.

236
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,840
I'll include a link in the video description to the complaints page,

237
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,280
which looks like this.

238
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,920
And then I'm gonna click the make a complaint button there,

239
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
which takes us to this page.

240
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,800
From the drop-down menu under what is your complaint about,

241
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm going to select BBC website or apps,

242
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,080
and then BBC news website.

243
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,600
When it asks for the URL,

244
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,640
I'm gonna paste the URL of the awful news article,

245
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,160
which I'll include below.

246
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,040
Then are you contacting us about a previous complaint?

247
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
No, and continue.

248
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,520
So select the best category to describe your complaint.

249
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,840
And honestly, it could be anything here.

250
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,840
Bias, factual error, offense, poor quality.

251
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,200
But I'm gonna select factual error or inaccuracy here.

252
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,880
You see, my gut is telling me to focus on the one particular lie

253
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,040
about no prominent trans women wanting to talk to the author of the article.

254
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,040
It is an obvious falsehood, it is very easy to express,

255
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,200
and it's impossible to refute.

256
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,640
The BBC cannot respond honestly here in any way,

257
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,720
except to further amend the article to remove this lie.

258
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,800
Anything else they say in response will make them look even more biased.

259
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,760
I will include the text of my complaint in the video description,

260
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,280
but would encourage you to, only if you feel like it, of course,

261
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,520
complain about any or all of the various problems with the article.

262
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,000
And maybe you could share your complaints in the comments

263
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,360
to perhaps inspire people in forming their own complaints.

264
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm also going to select that I do want a response to my complaints,

265
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,520
because I want to see what they say in their defense here.

266
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,480
Now, before I go today, I just want to address one response

267
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
that I know this video will get.

268
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,840
You see, the article qualifies its criticism of trans women

269
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,960
by saying, some trans women, a minority of trans women, and so on.

270
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,760
So they can't be being biased because they're saying

271
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,240
it's a problem specific to some trans women, not all trans women.

272
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
This is a cowardly tactic intended to provide cover for the BBC

273
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,760
while it shares the messages of anti-trans hate groups.

274
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,320
The BBC is being biased, regardless of these cowardly qualifiers.

275
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,240
As we've seen today, some cis lesbians, like Lily Cade, pressure people into sex.

276
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,080
But the BBC are not writing that article, are they?

277
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,680
Of course, if Lily Cade was trans, she would be featured prominently here

278
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,160
as one of the trans women pressuring people into sex.

279
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,200
But because she isn't trans, Lily Cade gets quietly cut from the story.

280
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,520
So I don't buy these qualifiers.

281
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,680
I don't think they're meant honestly.

282
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,200
If they were meant honestly, then this article wouldn't exist.

283
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Anyway, that's all from me today, folks.

284
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,120
I'll see you next time.
