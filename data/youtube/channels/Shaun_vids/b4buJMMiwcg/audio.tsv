0	1440	Hello, everyone.
1440	9160	Today, I'm going to talk about a truly disgusting article that was posted on the BBC News website on the 26th of October.
9160	9960	That being,
9960	15240	We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Trans Women, written by Carolyn Lowbridge.
15240	21040	Now, hateful transphobic bigotry is very much the norm throughout most of the British news media,
21040	25680	but for various reasons, this article stands out as especially repulsive.
25920	32000	This article attempts to make the case that cis lesbians are being sexually assaulted by predatory trans women
32000	35480	on a level that goes beyond the actions of individuals.
35480	42080	Cis lesbians, as a group, are in danger from trans women, is the point this article is trying to make.
42080	46160	Now, of course, a member of any group of people can pressure or coerce someone into sex,
46160	50400	but we cannot use that fact to tar the whole group with the same brush.
50400	55160	Using the actions of an individual to discriminate against an entire group is...
55160	57200	Well, it's discrimination, isn't it?
57200	59240	The BBC could just as well print,
59240	62680	We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Cis Lesbians,
62680	67600	and use isolated incidents of people being sexually assaulted by cis lesbians
67600	71600	to make the case that the lesbian community is inherently dangerous.
71600	78120	Now, that would be ridiculous, homophobic discrimination, and exactly as valid as this article.
78120	80360	The BBC would not write the articles,
80360	83360	We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Black Men,
83400	86680	or We're Being Pressured Into Sex by Some Jews,
86680	90240	but it can get away with writing the exact same thing about trans women
90240	93400	because of the media environment into which it's being released,
93400	96040	which is an openly transphobic one.
96040	98760	So I disagree with this article in conception.
98760	102120	I think it is a textbook case of bigoted discrimination,
102120	104840	but it gets much worse, trust me.
104840	107120	Now, for an article with this title,
107120	112720	you might expect it would mainly be concerned with people being pressured into sex by trans women,
112720	118160	but the article contains only two reported instances of trans women pressuring someone into sex.
118160	121600	It's actually much more concerned with hypothetical scenarios,
121600	125000	or with differences of opinion within the LGBT community
125000	129640	that have nothing whatsoever to do with trans women pressuring people into sex.
129640	132240	For instance, it tells the story of a cis lesbian
132240	135640	whose girlfriend wanted them to have a threesome with a trans woman,
135640	138920	but she didn't want to, and they had an argument about that.
138920	142240	Now, no trans woman is pressuring anyone here.
142240	144920	They're not even involved in the story directly.
144920	147920	This is something going on between two cis women.
147920	151200	This story has no business being alongside someone saying
151200	155760	I was actually pressured into sex as if those two things were equivalent.
155760	160880	Now, in an attempt to prove that trans women pressuring people into sex is an actual phenomenon
160880	163760	and not just a number of isolated incidents,
163760	166000	the same as we would expect of any group,
166000	172000	the article cites a questionnaire distributed by the fringe transphobic hate group Get The L Out,
172000	175360	which reported that of the 80 women who did respond,
175360	181760	56% reported being pressured or coerced to accept a trans woman as a sexual partner.
181760	184720	Now, there are lots of problems with this questionnaire.
184720	191440	Firstly, it specifically refuses to gender trans women correctly using he and him throughout.
191440	196480	Given that, and the fact that Get The L Out distributed this study via social media,
196480	199280	gives rise to obvious bias issues,
199280	205840	specifically in terms of who would respond to this clearly biased hateful propaganda in the first place.
205840	210480	But a bigger issue is what the questionnaire considers to be pressure or coercion.
210480	214320	In the section of the findings, which reports the 56% figure,
214320	220720	it states most respondents reported being subjected to such rhetoric directly or indirectly
220720	224960	with the general feeling that it's online everywhere and relentless.
225600	229680	Now, this is not trans women pressuring people into sex.
229680	235680	This is some transphobes seeing trans acceptance on the internet and not liking that.
236240	238720	They don't think that trans women are women,
238720	242240	so when they see people online treating trans women as women,
242240	246000	they take that as a personal attack, but it isn't.
246000	250080	And we see a similar attitude in the section titled Deception.
250080	253840	Several respondents discussed their experiences of deception
253840	257280	while being approached by trans women they assumed to be women.
257280	260320	They reported feeling betrayed and violated.
260320	264800	So just trans women passing is being classed as deception here.
264800	266640	They're taking it personally.
266640	271680	They're acting like, by itself, a trans woman passing is an attack upon them.
271680	277680	What is being included as pressure or coercion here is simply trans women existing.
277680	282240	And we see a very clear indication of this when the questionnaire shares that awful quote
282240	287760	by Janice Raymond comparing trans people's existence at all to the act of rape.
288320	292560	And it is incredibly unfair to actual survivors of sexual assault
292560	296240	to have their experiences categorized alongside things like
296240	298640	I didn't realize someone was trans,
298640	302160	or not enough people are being transphobic on the internet,
302160	305360	or simply just trans people exist.
305360	309360	This is just hate speech very shoddily dressed up as a study,
309360	314800	and it is utterly embarrassing that the BBC shared this as if it was legitimate.
314800	316080	But to be clear here,
316080	321200	even though this rubbish is clearly discriminatory and put out by an obviously biased group
321200	326240	and pads what we can mockingly call its findings with utter irrelevancies,
326240	329520	I am absolutely not casting doubt on any of the respondents
329520	332320	who reported actual sexual harassment or coercion.
332880	336880	All I will say is that, firstly, we cannot use their individual experiences
336880	339360	to discriminate against an entire group of people.
339360	344240	And secondly, nobody at the BBC responsible for sharing the findings of this study
344240	347600	cares at all about women being sexually assaulted.
347600	351760	Carolyn Lowbridge does not care about women being sexually assaulted,
351760	354880	except for how she can use that to attack trans people.
354880	357440	And this is not something I say lightly.
357440	359440	There is absolute proof here.
359440	363120	You see, this article featured prominently as a source Lily Cade,
363120	365200	an adult film performer who, quote,
371200	375280	Now, I dislike the very gatekeep-y gold star lesbian phrase there,
375280	379120	but leaving that aside, Cade gets quoted several times in the article,
379120	382480	and there's also a big picture of her posing for the cameras there.
382480	385760	So, trusted BBC source Lily Cade here,
385760	389840	giving her thoughts about trans women pressuring people into sex.
389840	391360	Now, there's an issue with this,
391360	395520	and that is Lily Cade is someone who is accused of, and has admitted to,
395520	398000	a series of sexual assaults.
398000	400400	Multiple people in the industry Lily Cade worked in
400400	402720	reported that she sexually assaulted them,
402720	406480	and this is something that was known about long before this article came out.
406480	408880	So, what is Lily Cade doing here,
408880	412080	being given a platform by the BBC to share her thoughts
412080	414960	in an article about women being pressured into sex?
414960	417840	If the BBC cared about women being pressured into sex,
417840	422640	why not mention that their source has a history of sexually assaulting women?
422640	425200	So, we can say, maybe they didn't know.
425200	427840	Maybe Carolyn Lowbridge, when writing this article,
427840	431360	didn't bother to Google the names of the people she was talking to,
431360	435440	or maybe just nobody informed her of the allegations against Lily Cade.
436000	439360	Except, that's not true, and we can prove it.
439360	443360	And to do so, we first need to correct an outright lie in the article.
443360	445520	So, in the section of the article titled,
445520	446800	Who else was approached?
446800	448480	Carolyn Lowbridge writes,
462400	464400	Now, this is not true.
464400	467440	So, Chelsea Poe is a high-profile trans woman
467440	470640	who has spoken extensively about sex and relationships,
470640	475200	being interviewed in the Huffington Post, Glamour, Slate, and so on.
475200	478560	Chelsea Poe claims that she was interviewed by Carolyn Lowbridge
478560	482160	for the BBC article, but that her contribution was cut.
482160	484400	She also claims that she informed the BBC
484400	487200	about the sexual assaults carried out by Lily Cade,
487200	490320	but that, to quote a Pink News article about this incident,
490320	493840	there was not much of a reaction from the journalist.
493840	496080	Now, we know that this interview took place.
496080	498720	Chelsea Poe tweeted about talking to the BBC
498720	501840	and Carolyn Lowbridge in September of last year,
501840	504400	and the BBC itself confirmed to Pink News
504400	506000	that Lowbridge interviewed Poe,
506000	506720	but that, quote,
521200	523600	Now, firstly here, the BBC has been caught
523600	525920	in an outright falsehood, obviously.
525920	529360	The article states, today, it still says this,
529360	533600	that no high-profile trans women wanted to talk to Carolyn Lowbridge,
533600	536160	while neglecting to mention that they did.
536160	538880	They were interviewed, and then she cut them.
538880	542000	And now she's pretending that nobody wanted to talk to her,
542000	544240	that she couldn't find a willing participant
544240	545680	to give an alternate viewpoint.
546240	548080	And this is just lying.
548080	550400	Just open lying.
550400	553120	Secondly, this article is purportedly about women
553120	554480	feeling pressured into sex,
554480	557040	and you were told one of your main sources
557040	560160	is someone who repeatedly sexually assaulted women.
560800	562880	How could that not be relevant?
563600	565680	It couldn't be more relevant.
565680	567200	It seems obvious to say,
567200	571520	but if Carolyn Lowbridge or anyone at the BBC responsible for this article
571520	574480	cared at all about women being sexually assaulted,
574480	576720	they never would have given a platform
576720	581840	to someone who they knew they were told sexually assaulted women.
581840	585840	The only problem for them here is that Lily Cade isn't trans.
585840	589360	Her sexual assaults can't be weaponized to attack trans people,
589360	592000	so her sexual assaults don't count.
592000	593360	They're not relevant.
593600	597280	Lily Cade's actions speak only to hair behavior for some reason,
597280	599520	and not any group she belongs to.
599520	601520	Lily Cade is afforded the dignity
601520	604720	of being considered responsible for her own actions,
604720	607840	not like those trans women who must be judged as a group
607840	609920	for the actions of individuals.
609920	612560	And of course, there is the additional indignity done
612560	616160	to the anonymous survivors of sexual assault quoted in the article
616160	619280	who were made to share a platform alongside someone
619280	621440	who sexually assaulted women.
621440	624080	Now, it might be hard to believe this,
624080	626160	but this story gets even worse.
626160	630080	You see, Lily Cade used the spotlight given to her by the BBC.
630080	633360	She used the attention this article generated for her
633360	636720	to publish a deranged genocidal manifesto,
637440	641280	seriously, calling for the murder of all trans women,
641280	643840	which included naming specific trans women
643840	646160	she wanted to personally quote,
646160	647040	Lynch.
647040	650720	And perhaps most pertinent for the topic at hand today,
650720	653280	Lily Cade didn't just make death threats,
653280	657840	but also rape threats against the families of trans people.
657840	660960	Now, after several days of trying to ignore that this happened,
660960	662800	the BBC caved to pressure
662800	666240	and removed Lily Cade's contribution from the article.
666240	669680	And the editorial note they included with the article reads as follows,
669680	672000	We have updated this article published last week
672000	674480	to remove a contribution from one individual
674480	678640	in light of comments she has published on blog posts in recent days,
678640	680160	which we have been able to verify.
680720	683680	We acknowledge that an admission of inappropriate behavior
683680	687200	by the same contributor should have been included in the original article.
687920	691600	So firstly, note the lack of apology for platforming a rapist
691600	694480	who writes serial killer manifestos.
694480	697840	But also, what's with the euphemisms here
697840	700160	in light of comments she published?
700160	703520	I guess that's what we're calling explicit death threats now.
704080	707600	Comments and inappropriate behavior.
707600	711200	Now, the article itself uses terms like rape and sexual assault
711200	713360	when attributing those things to trans women,
713360	717520	so why did they only talk about what Lily Cade did euphemistically?
717520	721920	And an admission of inappropriate behavior should have been included?
721920	724640	Apparently it would have been fine to platform Lily Cade
724640	727360	if only they'd included an admission of their quote,
727360	728880	inappropriate behavior.
729440	730720	And how would that work?
730720	732640	What would they have said, even?
732640	734960	Lily Cade, admitted rapist,
734960	738000	has some concerns about women being pressured into sex.
738000	739680	What sense would that make?
739680	743680	No, including Cade at all was wrong, the BBC.
743680	746160	You do not get to weasel out of this.
746160	751280	You must and will take this article down and give a full apology for it.
751280	753200	Not just for platforming Lily Cade,
753200	756240	but for the outright lies, the terrible research,
756240	758640	and the disgusting, bigoted premise.
759200	762400	Now, you might notice that I'm a little annoyed about this,
762400	764480	and I admit it, I am. This is awful.
765040	767760	BBC is supposed to be better than this.
769120	771840	It isn't, clearly, but it's supposed to be.
772560	776160	This article will be deleted and apologized for eventually,
776160	779440	depending on how stubborn the BBC wants to be about it,
779440	782000	which at the moment is very stubborn.
782000	786160	But before it is deleted, I feel compelled to speak up about it.
786160	788560	I don't like that this is happening in the BBC.
788560	791040	I don't like that this is happening in my country.
791040	793600	And I want to be able to say in the future
793600	796480	that I said something about it at the time.
796480	799600	So what I'm gonna do, in addition to making this video,
799600	802080	is submit a complaint to the BBC.
802080	804720	And I would encourage you to also make a complaint,
804720	807760	only if you feel compelled to do so, of course.
807760	810240	And we can do it together right now, actually.
810240	814400	So the BBC is a worldwide service, and they accept complaints from anywhere.
814400	816640	So don't worry if you're outside the UK.
816640	819840	I'll include a link in the video description to the complaints page,
819840	821280	which looks like this.
821280	823920	And then I'm gonna click the make a complaint button there,
823920	826000	which takes us to this page.
826000	828800	From the drop-down menu under what is your complaint about,
828800	831920	I'm going to select BBC website or apps,
831920	834080	and then BBC news website.
834080	835600	When it asks for the URL,
835600	838640	I'm gonna paste the URL of the awful news article,
838640	840160	which I'll include below.
840160	843040	Then are you contacting us about a previous complaint?
843040	844720	No, and continue.
844720	847520	So select the best category to describe your complaint.
847520	849840	And honestly, it could be anything here.
849920	853840	Bias, factual error, offense, poor quality.
853840	857200	But I'm gonna select factual error or inaccuracy here.
857200	860880	You see, my gut is telling me to focus on the one particular lie
860880	865040	about no prominent trans women wanting to talk to the author of the article.
865040	869040	It is an obvious falsehood, it is very easy to express,
869040	871200	and it's impossible to refute.
871200	874640	The BBC cannot respond honestly here in any way,
874640	878720	except to further amend the article to remove this lie.
878720	882800	Anything else they say in response will make them look even more biased.
882800	885760	I will include the text of my complaint in the video description,
885760	889280	but would encourage you to, only if you feel like it, of course,
889280	893520	complain about any or all of the various problems with the article.
893520	896000	And maybe you could share your complaints in the comments
896000	899360	to perhaps inspire people in forming their own complaints.
899360	902720	I'm also going to select that I do want a response to my complaints,
902720	905520	because I want to see what they say in their defense here.
905520	908480	Now, before I go today, I just want to address one response
908480	910000	that I know this video will get.
910560	913840	You see, the article qualifies its criticism of trans women
913840	918960	by saying, some trans women, a minority of trans women, and so on.
918960	921760	So they can't be being biased because they're saying
921760	926240	it's a problem specific to some trans women, not all trans women.
926240	930480	This is a cowardly tactic intended to provide cover for the BBC
930480	933760	while it shares the messages of anti-trans hate groups.
933760	938320	The BBC is being biased, regardless of these cowardly qualifiers.
938320	944240	As we've seen today, some cis lesbians, like Lily Cade, pressure people into sex.
944240	948080	But the BBC are not writing that article, are they?
948080	951680	Of course, if Lily Cade was trans, she would be featured prominently here
951680	954160	as one of the trans women pressuring people into sex.
954160	959200	But because she isn't trans, Lily Cade gets quietly cut from the story.
959200	961520	So I don't buy these qualifiers.
961520	963680	I don't think they're meant honestly.
963680	967200	If they were meant honestly, then this article wouldn't exist.
967760	969760	Anyway, that's all from me today, folks.
969760	971120	I'll see you next time.
