00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
Hello everyone. I'd like today to talk about the recent Quebec City mosque shooting,

00:05.920 --> 00:13.440
and in particular the evolving response to it on a certain online community that I'm a big fan of.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.880
So first we'll just give a brief overview of the event.

00:16.880 --> 00:23.720
On the 29th of January, during the evening prayers at the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec City,

00:23.880 --> 00:31.480
a lone gunman entered the premises and began firing at people, killing six, before fleeing.

00:31.480 --> 00:37.160
One suspect was initially detained at the scene, but was later released after police determined

00:37.160 --> 00:41.080
that he was just a bystander who's now considered a witness.

00:41.080 --> 00:45.120
The actual shooter, and I know I'm gonna pronounce this wrong here,

00:45.120 --> 00:50.120
Alexandre Bissonnette, that's probably as close as I'm gonna get,

00:50.360 --> 00:53.640
called the police shortly after fleeing and surrendered,

00:53.640 --> 00:59.640
and it later came to light that Bissonnette was a far-right, white nationalist Islamophobe.

00:59.640 --> 01:06.760
So what I'd like to do today is map out the response to this incident as various aspects of it came to light,

01:06.760 --> 01:14.480
and we'll be thinking in particular about how these sorts of incidents always give rise to various conspiracy theories.

01:14.560 --> 01:18.240
And I'll be looking in particular at FreeRepublic.com,

01:18.240 --> 01:23.920
which is a deeply conservative forum community that I dip into every now and then,

01:23.920 --> 01:26.520
if I feel like being annoyed about something.

01:26.520 --> 01:32.640
I'll also be looking at the response by the various faces of the YouTube channel Rebel Media,

01:32.640 --> 01:35.520
who I briefly featured in my previous video.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.440
And before I get started, a little disclaimer.

01:38.440 --> 01:42.560
This isn't merely some victory lap about the shooting, you know.

01:42.600 --> 01:47.760
All these people thought it was a Muslim shooter, but then it turned out it was an Islamophobe shooter.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.400
Hardy-heart, they're all wrong.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.360
You know, I'm not interested in just doing that, because after all, this is still a mass shooting,

01:55.360 --> 01:57.520
and people died, and it's a tragedy.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.600
There's an element of making fun of them, sure,

02:01.600 --> 02:07.040
but I promise it's all in service to an actual point here that I think it's important to make.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.960
And so, let's get to it.

02:09.120 --> 02:15.120
We'll start at the beginning with the first breaking news reports being posted on FreeRepublic.com.

02:15.600 --> 02:19.520
So, this thread is the first time the incident was mentioned on the forum,

02:19.520 --> 02:23.360
and being an early report, it's very light on the details.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.720
You know, multiple shots fired, people feared injured, police have set up a perimeter,

02:29.280 --> 02:34.240
and naturally, there's no mention of the motive or identity of the suspect.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.400
And here's where we take our first step on the road to our conspiracy theory.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.080
The obvious Islamophobe reaction to news of a shooting

02:42.080 --> 02:44.640
is to assume that the perpetrator is a Muslim.

02:45.440 --> 02:50.720
This step is slightly complicated here, because the victims were also Muslims,

02:50.720 --> 02:55.040
which means we have to do a little imaginative speculating.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.400
An early comment from user TLI says,

02:58.960 --> 03:02.800
"...multiple dead? Yeah, sounds internal.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.680
Might have been more that one popped their cork,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.320
perhaps two families went after each other?"

03:09.200 --> 03:14.720
User AFoolInParadise postulates it may have been an honor killing,

03:14.720 --> 03:19.840
and user Wendell is taking bets that the shooting arose from the conflict

03:19.840 --> 03:22.240
between different denominations of Islam.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.840
So it's clear the kind of thing that they're expecting.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.000
Now, around this time, in a thread on Reddit about the incident,

03:30.000 --> 03:34.240
a user called The underscore GMD posted this.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.120
Confirmed on police radio.

03:37.120 --> 03:41.840
The two suspects are Bashir al-Tawid and Hassan Matti,

03:41.840 --> 03:45.520
Syrians who entered Canada as refugees last week.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.640
Now, this isn't true.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.880
This is just some rubbish someone made up,

03:50.880 --> 03:56.800
but since it implicates Muslims, it of course caught on and did the rounds on Twitter

03:56.800 --> 03:59.520
and made its way to Free Republic.

03:59.520 --> 04:04.080
User NowApproachingMidnight reposted the fake names.

04:05.120 --> 04:09.680
Now, they did charitably add the word unconfirmed at the start of their post.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.520
Not that anyone appears to have read it, mind you.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.560
User RedWolf replied,

04:16.560 --> 04:17.920
"...and it's Muslims."

04:18.720 --> 04:22.400
User Lazamataz posted a sarcastic reply,

04:22.400 --> 04:26.320
mocking the idea that the shooter could have been a right-wing Canadian,

04:26.320 --> 04:30.400
which of course, considering later developments, is rather funny.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.680
User GoldStateGOP posted,

04:33.680 --> 04:34.880
"...I'm not surprised.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.920
Muzzies attacking fellow muzzies.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.240
Justin Trudeau's children."

04:41.360 --> 04:44.080
They really don't like Justin Trudeau, by the way.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.040
User Littleharbour posted,

04:47.600 --> 04:51.120
"...it's becoming apparent that this is a Muslim-on-Muslim attack."

04:51.920 --> 04:54.480
Of course, there's absolutely no evidence so far

04:54.480 --> 04:58.080
to support that the shooter or shooters were Muslims,

04:58.080 --> 05:02.960
but so strong is this conservative, Islamophobe desire to blame a Muslim

05:02.960 --> 05:06.480
that they've all already decided that it's the case.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.880
User Van Schuyten comments that,

05:08.880 --> 05:14.400
"...if it were refugees, this'll be good because of its political impact."

05:14.400 --> 05:17.600
And this is echoed by user SouthernerFromTheNorth,

05:17.600 --> 05:19.920
who says, "...it could be a game changer.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.200
Refugees need to be stopped everywhere.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.720
Can Trump rule for other countries too?"

05:28.400 --> 05:28.900
Yikes.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.720
User Aquila48 says,

05:32.720 --> 05:34.640
"...what a gift they handed Trump."

05:35.360 --> 05:38.640
And then they write some Trump Twitter fanfic

05:38.640 --> 05:41.280
that has Trump gloating about the attacks.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.360
And user Yardstick says,

05:45.360 --> 05:48.880
"...frankly, the timing couldn't be better for Trump."

05:48.880 --> 05:51.920
And this sort of thing is why I really like Free Republic.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.840
There's no attempt to dull the edges of any of these horrible opinions.

05:55.840 --> 05:59.840
They're just openly being happy about murders happening,

05:59.840 --> 06:02.000
so long as it makes Trump look good.

06:02.560 --> 06:08.480
Free Republic is like having a direct line into modern conservative thought,

06:08.480 --> 06:12.160
completely unfettered by things like political correctness,

06:12.160 --> 06:16.240
or societal norms, or basic human decency.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.480
So at this point, there's still been no actual information

06:20.560 --> 06:22.240
released by the Canadian police,

06:22.240 --> 06:27.600
but that hasn't stopped Free Republic from having the whole incident figured out.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.200
There were two shooters,

06:29.200 --> 06:33.840
they were Syrian refugees called Bashir al-Tawhid and Hassan Matti,

06:33.840 --> 06:36.480
they arrived in Canada last week,

06:36.480 --> 06:41.920
and they carried out the killings as part of some sort of internal Islamic factional conflict.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.520
Simple.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.600
Now since this is all so obvious,

06:45.600 --> 06:50.240
we can move on to the second step of our conspiracy theory creation process

06:50.240 --> 06:50.960
by asking,

06:51.680 --> 06:56.560
why is it taking the police so long to confirm all these things that we already know?

06:57.520 --> 07:01.520
Why haven't the police confirmed that the attacker was a Muslim?

07:01.520 --> 07:06.080
You see, the next thing the police did was announce that they had two suspects in custody,

07:06.080 --> 07:09.920
those being Alexandre Bissonnette, the actual shooter,

07:09.920 --> 07:12.320
and Mohamed El-Kadhia, the witness,

07:12.320 --> 07:14.640
but they hadn't yet announced their names.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.280
And so, why not?

07:17.840 --> 07:21.040
User Mandaledon says,

07:21.040 --> 07:24.000
"...still not telling the public who the terrorists are,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.640
which probably means they have Muslim names."

07:27.600 --> 07:30.240
And user Major Pelham agrees,

07:30.240 --> 07:35.280
saying that the delay on releasing the suspects' names is a dead giveaway at this point.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.280
User Kevin in California says,

07:39.280 --> 07:43.840
"...no reports on them must mean they're not blonde slash blue-eyed."

07:43.840 --> 07:46.320
And Desert Rhino says similar,

07:46.320 --> 07:50.720
"...Trudo would use the label terrorist if it was a couple of white guys.

07:50.720 --> 07:55.200
Three hours without a peep tells me they're trying to figure out how to spin this."

07:55.920 --> 07:59.600
User Rommiechick gets right to the point and says,

07:59.600 --> 08:04.320
"...can't be white, it would have already hit the news by the libtards."

08:04.960 --> 08:06.480
JLB says,

08:06.480 --> 08:09.360
"...for once I really thought it might be some religion

08:09.360 --> 08:11.920
other than Muslims perpetrating the killings."

08:12.480 --> 08:15.120
The perfect record continues.

08:16.800 --> 08:17.840
Hmm.

08:17.840 --> 08:23.920
Outside of Free Republic, this is where we start to see our pals over at Rebel Media chiming in.

08:24.640 --> 08:29.520
Gavin McInnes, seen here doing something incredibly racist,

08:30.400 --> 08:33.200
commented on an early report saying,

08:33.200 --> 08:36.320
"...just need the shooter's first name please news."

08:36.880 --> 08:40.720
Ezra Levant posted, and then I guess retweeted himself,

08:40.720 --> 08:43.920
asking why there hadn't been any suspects' names released.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.240
Then followed that up by saying,

08:46.960 --> 08:51.840
"...Quebec police just said he won't name Muslim mosque attack suspects

08:51.840 --> 08:54.000
because there are legal procedures."

08:55.040 --> 08:55.540
Really?

08:56.400 --> 08:57.920
Well, yes, really.

08:57.920 --> 09:02.240
You see, Ezra, there's a few actual reasons that police are hesitant

09:02.240 --> 09:05.440
to immediately release the names of people suspected of crimes,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.560
regardless of their race or religion.

09:08.560 --> 09:12.160
The first is a basic matter of public safety,

09:12.160 --> 09:15.200
especially with high-profile incidents like this one.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.120
You know, you can't come out and say,

09:17.120 --> 09:21.680
"...we just arrested John Smith of Number 10 Kings Road for this terrible crime,

09:21.680 --> 09:25.600
and by the way, here's a map to his house," for instance.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.200
The next reason is so that police can protect themselves legally,

09:29.200 --> 09:33.840
because what if it later turns out that John Smith didn't do the terrible crime

09:33.840 --> 09:37.920
and didn't much like his name and face being out there in news stories,

09:37.920 --> 09:39.440
calling him a murderer?

09:39.440 --> 09:42.480
He'd have a pretty good defamation case there.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.720
And it's honestly kind of surprising Ezra Levant wouldn't understand

09:46.720 --> 09:49.200
the potential legal ramifications here,

09:49.200 --> 09:53.680
considering how many times that he himself has been sued for libel,

09:53.680 --> 09:58.560
several times having to publicly apologize and pay damages to people

09:58.560 --> 10:00.320
he's been telling fibs about,

10:01.040 --> 10:04.560
including a Mr. George Soros, funnily enough,

10:04.560 --> 10:08.480
and I bet that apology particularly stunk, didn't it, Ezra?

10:09.200 --> 10:12.800
Now, pretending to wonder why the police haven't released information

10:12.800 --> 10:15.920
about the suspect in a shooting happens every time,

10:15.920 --> 10:20.000
even though this incident, with a white, non-Islamic shooter,

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
should prove to everyone that the police always delay releasing the suspect's names,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.800
regardless of ethnicity or religion.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.800
It won't, though, you know?

10:31.680 --> 10:34.480
Jumping to conclusions is just too fun,

10:34.480 --> 10:38.800
and it's a favorite pastime of all manner of idiots.

10:38.800 --> 10:43.680
Here's the perpetually outraged Paul Joseph Watson posting it,

10:43.680 --> 10:49.040
and even Twitter egg come to life Stefan Molyneux couldn't resist retweeting someone else,

10:49.600 --> 10:50.640
wondering the same.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.880
Now, handily enough for me,

10:53.600 --> 10:57.440
the rebel media guys were rather sloppy with their initial responses

10:57.440 --> 10:59.440
and kind of gave the game away a bit.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.040
Look at the language in Ezra Levant's tweet.

11:03.040 --> 11:06.080
Police won't name the Muslim mosque attackers,

11:06.080 --> 11:11.600
or Gavin McInnis, who reacted to news that a pig's head was left at the mosque last year

11:11.600 --> 11:12.240
by saying,

11:12.800 --> 11:16.800
"...pretty sure these Muslims would rather be offended by a Christian

11:16.800 --> 11:18.960
than shot at by a Muslim."

11:19.600 --> 11:22.000
Which doesn't really make sense on any level,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.480
but it is rather enlightening, you see.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.280
Like the folks over at Free Republic,

11:27.280 --> 11:32.560
rebel media has also already decided that the attackers were Muslims,

11:33.040 --> 11:36.720
and that the police were therefore delaying releasing their names because...

11:38.400 --> 11:38.960
something?

11:39.600 --> 11:42.160
Because police are meant to really like Muslims?

11:43.120 --> 11:43.620
I guess.

11:44.400 --> 11:49.040
Now, adding fuel to the fire of these speculations is an early witness report

11:49.040 --> 11:52.720
that cries of Allah Akbar were heard during the shooting.

11:53.520 --> 11:58.160
That phrase, of course, being the thing that the bad guys shout on the TV

11:58.160 --> 11:59.840
when they're being evil.

11:59.840 --> 12:04.400
The rebel media crew all tweeted out the Allah Akbar report.

12:04.400 --> 12:10.080
For example, his otherwise uninvolved, amazing, brainless woman, Lauren Southern,

12:10.080 --> 12:12.960
chiming in with her obligatory tweet on the subject.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.760
Now, after the name of the shooter...

12:16.800 --> 12:20.400
And remember, what they're really asking when they're asking for the name of the shooter is,

12:20.960 --> 12:22.240
what color was he?

12:22.880 --> 12:23.380
Anyway.

12:23.920 --> 12:28.640
After that, everyone always wants to know if the shooter shouted Allah Akbar,

12:28.640 --> 12:32.160
which is, of course, the thing the baddies say in the movies,

12:32.160 --> 12:36.400
and has no other meanings or applications at all.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.000
Hi, kid.

12:38.000 --> 12:38.640
Of course.

12:38.640 --> 12:43.120
So, the Allah Akbar witness report comes from CBC News in Canada,

12:43.120 --> 12:47.440
who quoted an anonymous witness calling into Radio Canada

12:47.440 --> 12:50.560
and saying that there were two gunmen with...

12:52.160 --> 12:53.360
Look at that word right there.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.080
Where am I gonna go with this one, do you reckon?

12:56.080 --> 12:56.800
I'm gonna say...

12:57.680 --> 12:58.320
Quebecie.

12:59.840 --> 13:04.720
With Quebecie accents, who both shouted Allah Akbar.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.560
There's no identification of this witness,

13:08.560 --> 13:13.280
who could literally be anyone calling in and saying any old nonsense,

13:13.280 --> 13:17.920
but, barring that, even though they were wrong about the number of shooters,

13:17.920 --> 13:22.080
they could have been right about hearing Allah Akbar be spoken.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.600
They were apparently at a mosque during evening prayers.

13:26.080 --> 13:30.000
So I think it'd be weird to not hear Allah Akbar be said,

13:30.800 --> 13:34.800
because, of course, many Muslims say Allah Akbar for a variety of reasons.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.160
It's not exclusively a terrorist phrase.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.440
And even Bissonnette could have said it mockingly.

13:41.440 --> 13:45.680
You know, it's not the automatic Islamic terrorist signifier

13:45.680 --> 13:48.160
certain people seem to want it to be.

13:48.800 --> 13:54.160
Free Republic user Civil War Brewing candidly shows us the real reason

13:54.240 --> 13:56.880
that Allah Akbar gets such press by saying,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.320
witnesses said he shouted Allah Akbar as he fired his AK-47.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.760
Definitely a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant Trump supporter.

14:08.320 --> 14:13.440
Now this anonymous witness account will be important to the later conspiracy theory,

14:13.440 --> 14:17.200
as it will be continually brought up as unexplained.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.440
Which is because the source was an anonymous witness

14:21.440 --> 14:26.000
calling into a radio show one time, so, you know, whatever.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.600
Anyway, let's move on a little in the timeline now

14:29.600 --> 14:34.880
to the point where the Canadian police released the names of the two men they were holding.

14:34.880 --> 14:39.360
And one Free Republic threat from this time is particularly notable,

14:39.360 --> 14:43.600
because it's responding to an Associated Press article which says,

14:43.680 --> 14:47.520
Quebec City court clerk Isabelle Fairland identified

14:47.520 --> 14:52.160
Alexandre Bissonnette and Mohamed El-Kadhir as the suspects.

14:52.160 --> 14:57.440
Police later said one of them was just a witness, though they did not say which.

14:58.080 --> 15:04.400
Now, if I didn't know any better, I'd say this was a conscious attempt to set up Islamophobes.

15:04.400 --> 15:09.760
For a fall, we are about to get into some wily coyote shit here.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.960
We may need Sherlock Holmes to crack this case.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.680
Ooh, ooh, I know which one.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.040
Pick me, pick me.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.560
Which means Alexandre Bissonnette was the witness,

15:20.560 --> 15:23.200
and Mohamed El-Kadhir was the shooter.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.720
Otherwise, we'd have been told immediately.

15:26.720 --> 15:31.120
If they're holding back the information, it's more likely it's the Muslim.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.680
The press doesn't protect white guys.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.280
I know, I know.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.840
Hardee-ha, they're all wrong.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.680
Now, unfortunately, the laughs didn't last all that long,

15:41.680 --> 15:46.880
as very shortly after that, the police revealed that it was, in fact, Mohamed El-Kadhir,

15:46.880 --> 15:49.680
who was the witness, and Bissonnette the shooter.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.360
Apparently having no consideration for how funny it would have been

15:53.360 --> 15:56.560
to withhold that information for another day or so,

15:57.120 --> 16:00.560
they have no sense of comic irony, the police.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.640
For example, rebel media giant air quotes

16:04.640 --> 16:08.960
correspondent Gavin McInnes was midway through making a video

16:08.960 --> 16:12.560
about the fact that it was obviously the Muslim guy who did it,

16:13.280 --> 16:14.800
which starts out like this.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.280
What was it, the same day that Justin Trudeau,

16:19.280 --> 16:21.920
the prime minister of Canada in one of his silly costumes,

16:21.920 --> 16:24.000
I think he was dressed like a Chinaman that day,

16:24.000 --> 16:24.800
says,

16:24.800 --> 16:28.880
hey, refugees being rejected from America, come to Canada, we have room for you.

16:29.440 --> 16:32.320
As he says that, shooting in a mosque.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.800
And as with all shootings, we have one question.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.800
As a Western culture, we say,

16:39.440 --> 16:41.280
what was his first name, please?

16:41.280 --> 16:43.520
Waiting, and it's Mohamed.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.080
Okay.

16:44.080 --> 16:47.600
But police released the witness before he could get it out there,

16:47.600 --> 16:53.600
so he instead plays it off like the police media narrative is changing so fast we can't keep up.

16:54.320 --> 16:59.840
All these new details keep coming out so fast we don't even have time to report on it.

16:59.840 --> 17:05.360
You know, apparently missing the fact that he could just wait for the full story to be out.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.160
So anyway, police released the Muslim witness

17:08.160 --> 17:12.320
and declared that the white Canadian Bissonette is the only suspect,

17:12.880 --> 17:17.440
which you might expect to be a bit of a knock to the Islamophobe narrative here.

17:18.320 --> 17:19.440
But you'd be wrong.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.880
We're not dealing with amateurs here, you know.

17:22.880 --> 17:27.360
If the shooter turned out to be Bissonette, that in itself would indicate nothing.

17:27.360 --> 17:32.400
We have several instances in Canada of non-Muslim born or raised converts,

17:32.400 --> 17:37.200
sympathizers of radical Islam, committing acts of terrorism.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.360
Nobody should assume that if Bissonette,

17:39.360 --> 17:42.720
then white supremacist agenda is a valid paradigm.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.240
Wait and see.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.400
Wait and see.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.720
Yeah, now it's a white guy.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.760
We wait and see.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.200
Probably a recent convert to Islam.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.000
And I have heard reports agreeing with that.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.920
Anyone can convert to Islam and be brainwashed.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.920
It's an evil ideology.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.520
Now the Islamic convert angle doesn't last long

18:05.520 --> 18:08.480
in the light of emerging reports describing Bissonette

18:08.480 --> 18:11.120
as a far-right-wing white nationalist type,

18:11.760 --> 18:16.000
at which point you'd think the Islamophobes would just give this one up.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.440
It's a lost cause.

18:17.440 --> 18:21.200
Admit you were wrong, take the hit, and move on.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.360
However, I smell something fishy.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.160
Very suspect reporting to me.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.440
I want more information about this incident.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.040
Very fishy.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.160
Everything is so fishy about this.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.760
We just don't know enough about this case.

18:39.760 --> 18:40.560
Yet.

18:40.560 --> 18:44.080
If this story was about an Islamophobe shooting up the mosque,

18:44.080 --> 18:46.720
we'd have heard all about it by now.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.760
The truth doesn't need time or delay.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.040
Something stinks.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.480
Now this comment is really something special.

18:54.480 --> 19:00.160
The exact same delay that was previously supposed to indicate a Muslim shooter

19:00.160 --> 19:05.440
has been repurposed to now mean that it can't have been an Islamophobe shooter,

19:05.440 --> 19:07.440
or we'd have already heard about it,

19:08.480 --> 19:11.680
even though we are currently hearing about it.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.320
And if we try and map out that statement logically,

19:14.320 --> 19:18.560
I guess we get this didn't happen because this doesn't happen,

19:18.560 --> 19:24.080
which is a pretty nifty all-purpose reality-defying argument there.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.400
Our pals over at Rebel Media are also reluctant to give it up,

19:28.400 --> 19:30.800
and hey, who can blame them?

19:30.800 --> 19:33.760
If you set up the website Quebec Terror

19:33.760 --> 19:38.640
and send a reporter and a cameraman to the scene to do a whole bunch of news reports

19:38.640 --> 19:43.600
and get all your correspondence, spending their time contributing material about it,

19:43.600 --> 19:46.400
and then the shooter turns out to not be a Muslim,

19:46.400 --> 19:50.080
but actually a white Canadian who doesn't like Muslims,

19:50.880 --> 19:51.600
like you,

19:52.320 --> 19:55.520
you must be feeling pretty fucking stupid right now.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.920
You were expecting to bag yourself a big, tasty Islamic terror story

19:59.920 --> 20:02.080
to harp on about for the rest of the year,

20:02.080 --> 20:05.360
and you instead wasted your time and money covering a story

20:05.360 --> 20:08.400
that actually harms the narrative you want to spread.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.200
So they're backed into a corner at this point, frankly.

20:11.200 --> 20:15.520
They have to keep running with the idea that this was an act of Islamic terror,

20:15.520 --> 20:18.720
which means they now have to argue that there was a cover-up

20:18.720 --> 20:22.000
and the witness who was released was the actual shooter,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.880
except they're not allowed to actually say that

20:24.960 --> 20:27.520
because now it's libelous and they'll get sued.

20:28.080 --> 20:33.760
So all they can do is flaccidly poke at it with the same tactic employed on freerepublic.com,

20:33.760 --> 20:34.480
which is saying,

20:35.440 --> 20:36.320
this is weird.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.400
Isn't it, this story?

20:38.400 --> 20:40.240
It's, uh, it's really weird.

20:41.040 --> 20:41.840
Isn't it odd?

20:42.720 --> 20:44.080
It's a bit fishy, you know?

20:44.080 --> 20:46.400
It just, it doesn't add up.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.960
Because this story is not even close to being done.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.560
It's just, it's so curious.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.560
Things here look weird.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.480
That makes this super weird.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.400
And that is not my conspiracy theories.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.360
That's not my speculation.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.080
That's me saying,

20:59.040 --> 21:00.240
what happened there?

21:00.240 --> 21:01.360
It's not conspiracy theory.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.920
These are valid questions and I just don't get it.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.880
Ezra, you know, we cover time and time again media party spin, etc.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.960
But for me, I just don't get how we're really the only ones asking this.

21:10.960 --> 21:11.680
It's so weird.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.840
We're going to try our best to cover it from here.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.120
I'd just like to highlight one segment of this particular video

21:17.120 --> 21:19.440
that I can't pass up commenting on.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.720
Let's take a watch.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.720
I want to know more about the suspects.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.560
I want to know more about the victims.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.600
I want to know more about the suspect's family.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.960
I want to know what drives a guy to go from zero to ten.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.960
A guy who has no priors, who has absolutely is not known to police whatsoever,

21:34.960 --> 21:36.800
did not post hateful things online.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.920
As far as we know, we have one pro-refugees group telling us

21:39.920 --> 21:44.160
that he was known to their Facebook group as being an anti-feminist, anti-refugee.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.600
Really, where's the evidence?

21:45.600 --> 21:49.920
So where's the evidence for Bissonnette being a right-wing Islamophobe?

21:49.920 --> 21:54.080
All we've got is witnesses saying that it's true.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.840
Much like another element of this story.

21:57.840 --> 22:02.720
But I don't see rebel media asking for proof that Allah Akbar was sheltered.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.960
An anonymous witness statement is good enough for them on that front,

22:06.960 --> 22:11.680
but when multiple named witnesses claim that the guy was a far-right Islamophobe,

22:11.680 --> 22:15.120
well, now we'd like to see some evidence, please.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.680
Witnesses suddenly aren't good enough anymore

22:17.680 --> 22:20.640
when they're saying things that we don't want to hear.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.680
Anyway, so we've watched the narrative twist and turn

22:23.680 --> 22:26.400
and shrug off consistent attacks by reality,

22:26.400 --> 22:29.920
and frankly, anyone who's still on board with it by this point

22:29.920 --> 22:33.600
is primed to believe in a conspiracy theory.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.040
How could they not?

22:35.040 --> 22:39.280
After coming so far, they're pot-committed to use a poker term.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.640
I'd actually bet that quite a few of these people

22:42.640 --> 22:46.560
aren't really all that committed to the false flag, cover-up,

22:46.560 --> 22:48.880
conspiracy theory side of things.

22:48.880 --> 22:53.280
This is more just an ideological saving of face.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.480
It's a way to put a cap on the rather uncomfortable idea

22:56.480 --> 23:00.320
that murderers can be any color or religion or nationality,

23:00.320 --> 23:03.600
and can even be someone just like you.

23:03.600 --> 23:07.600
It's hard to spot the bad guys when they could be anyone.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.960
It's much easier if the Muslims are the bad guys.

23:10.960 --> 23:14.880
They're typically easy to spot, if you catch my drift.

23:14.880 --> 23:20.160
So, if the shooter's a Muslim, then that's the fault of the Muslims, obviously,

23:20.160 --> 23:22.720
but if the shooter is a white Islamophobe,

23:22.720 --> 23:26.320
then it's a false flag conspiracy to make Muslims look good,

23:26.960 --> 23:30.400
and thus, still the fault of the Muslims.

23:30.400 --> 23:34.080
Which is a perfect argument, you know, there's no countering that.

23:34.080 --> 23:38.320
Now, before I go today, I'd just like to congratulate my old pal,

23:38.320 --> 23:40.800
Kraut & T, and why is that?

23:40.800 --> 23:42.240
Well, for this.

23:42.240 --> 23:46.240
The attack in Quebec briefly seemed to gain wider media attention

23:46.240 --> 23:48.080
and even less in our YouTube circles.

23:48.080 --> 23:51.840
I have often warned of making foregone conclusions over terrorist attacks

23:51.840 --> 23:53.440
when these are still happening,

23:53.440 --> 23:57.280
and this seems to be the extent to which reporting on this attack was limited.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.680
Brief announcements over Islamic terror,

23:59.680 --> 24:03.440
and after the realization that it wasn't Islamic, silence.

24:03.440 --> 24:07.200
So, well done, Katie, for so deftly avoiding the trap

24:07.200 --> 24:09.600
that so many others fell into.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.480
See, I give credit where credit's due, you know,

24:12.480 --> 24:16.800
Katie said, wait and see, and he avoided making himself look stupid,

24:16.800 --> 24:18.640
so, congratulations.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.680
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching, everyone,

24:21.680 --> 24:25.440
and thank you particularly to the names of the very kind people

24:25.440 --> 24:27.440
that should be scrolling past right now.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.080
Who are they, you might be wondering?

24:30.080 --> 24:33.440
Well, they're my supporters over on Patreon,

24:33.440 --> 24:36.800
which is a website that lets you give me a dollar, or whatever,

24:37.280 --> 24:38.960
when I make a video.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.120
Now, I don't know you,

24:41.680 --> 24:46.240
but I'm imagining that you're currently feeling a sense of incredible jealousy

24:46.240 --> 24:48.240
that your name is not on this list.

24:48.240 --> 24:51.200
Well, that's an easy fix, isn't it?

24:51.200 --> 24:54.000
Just head over to Patreon and press a few buttons,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.920
and next time I put a video out, your name will be up there too.

24:58.480 --> 25:03.280
I myself pledge to support a few content creators that I particularly enjoy,

25:03.280 --> 25:07.200
and let me tell you, it's a thrilling experience, start to finish.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.480
Thanks a lot, folks, and I'll see you next time.
