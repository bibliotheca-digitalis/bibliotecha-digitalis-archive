00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Hello everyone. I'd like today to talk about the recent Quebec City mosque shooting,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,440
and in particular the evolving response to it on a certain online community that I'm a big fan of.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,880
So first we'll just give a brief overview of the event.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,720
On the 29th of January, during the evening prayers at the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec City,

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:31,480
a lone gunman entered the premises and began firing at people, killing six, before fleeing.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,160
One suspect was initially detained at the scene, but was later released after police determined

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,080
that he was just a bystander who's now considered a witness.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,120
The actual shooter, and I know I'm gonna pronounce this wrong here,

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,120
Alexandre Bissonnette, that's probably as close as I'm gonna get,

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,640
called the police shortly after fleeing and surrendered,

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,640
and it later came to light that Bissonnette was a far-right, white nationalist Islamophobe.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,760
So what I'd like to do today is map out the response to this incident as various aspects of it came to light,

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:14,480
and we'll be thinking in particular about how these sorts of incidents always give rise to various conspiracy theories.

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,240
And I'll be looking in particular at FreeRepublic.com,

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,920
which is a deeply conservative forum community that I dip into every now and then,

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,520
if I feel like being annoyed about something.

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,640
I'll also be looking at the response by the various faces of the YouTube channel Rebel Media,

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
who I briefly featured in my previous video.

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,440
And before I get started, a little disclaimer.

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,560
This isn't merely some victory lap about the shooting, you know.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,760
All these people thought it was a Muslim shooter, but then it turned out it was an Islamophobe shooter.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Hardy-heart, they're all wrong.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,360
You know, I'm not interested in just doing that, because after all, this is still a mass shooting,

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
and people died, and it's a tragedy.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,600
There's an element of making fun of them, sure,

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,040
but I promise it's all in service to an actual point here that I think it's important to make.

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,960
And so, let's get to it.

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,120
We'll start at the beginning with the first breaking news reports being posted on FreeRepublic.com.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,520
So, this thread is the first time the incident was mentioned on the forum,

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
and being an early report, it's very light on the details.

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,720
You know, multiple shots fired, people feared injured, police have set up a perimeter,

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,240
and naturally, there's no mention of the motive or identity of the suspect.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,400
And here's where we take our first step on the road to our conspiracy theory.

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
The obvious Islamophobe reaction to news of a shooting

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
is to assume that the perpetrator is a Muslim.

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,720
This step is slightly complicated here, because the victims were also Muslims,

37
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,040
which means we have to do a little imaginative speculating.

38
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,400
An early comment from user TLI says,

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,800
"...multiple dead? Yeah, sounds internal.

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
Might have been more that one popped their cork,

41
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,320
perhaps two families went after each other?"

42
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,720
User AFoolInParadise postulates it may have been an honor killing,

43
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
and user Wendell is taking bets that the shooting arose from the conflict

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,240
between different denominations of Islam.

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,840
So it's clear the kind of thing that they're expecting.

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,000
Now, around this time, in a thread on Reddit about the incident,

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,240
a user called The underscore GMD posted this.

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
Confirmed on police radio.

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,840
The two suspects are Bashir al-Tawid and Hassan Matti,

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,520
Syrians who entered Canada as refugees last week.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,640
Now, this isn't true.

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,880
This is just some rubbish someone made up,

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,800
but since it implicates Muslims, it of course caught on and did the rounds on Twitter

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,520
and made its way to Free Republic.

55
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,080
User NowApproachingMidnight reposted the fake names.

56
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
Now, they did charitably add the word unconfirmed at the start of their post.

57
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Not that anyone appears to have read it, mind you.

58
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
User RedWolf replied,

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,920
"...and it's Muslims."

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,400
User Lazamataz posted a sarcastic reply,

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,320
mocking the idea that the shooter could have been a right-wing Canadian,

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
which of course, considering later developments, is rather funny.

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,680
User GoldStateGOP posted,

64
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
"...I'm not surprised.

65
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,920
Muzzies attacking fellow muzzies.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,240
Justin Trudeau's children."

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
They really don't like Justin Trudeau, by the way.

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
User Littleharbour posted,

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,120
"...it's becoming apparent that this is a Muslim-on-Muslim attack."

70
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,480
Of course, there's absolutely no evidence so far

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,080
to support that the shooter or shooters were Muslims,

72
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,960
but so strong is this conservative, Islamophobe desire to blame a Muslim

73
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,480
that they've all already decided that it's the case.

74
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,880
User Van Schuyten comments that,

75
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,400
"...if it were refugees, this'll be good because of its political impact."

76
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,600
And this is echoed by user SouthernerFromTheNorth,

77
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,920
who says, "...it could be a game changer.

78
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,200
Refugees need to be stopped everywhere.

79
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Can Trump rule for other countries too?"

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,900
Yikes.

81
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
User Aquila48 says,

82
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,640
"...what a gift they handed Trump."

83
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,640
And then they write some Trump Twitter fanfic

84
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,280
that has Trump gloating about the attacks.

85
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
And user Yardstick says,

86
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,880
"...frankly, the timing couldn't be better for Trump."

87
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,920
And this sort of thing is why I really like Free Republic.

88
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,840
There's no attempt to dull the edges of any of these horrible opinions.

89
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,840
They're just openly being happy about murders happening,

90
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,000
so long as it makes Trump look good.

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,480
Free Republic is like having a direct line into modern conservative thought,

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,160
completely unfettered by things like political correctness,

93
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,240
or societal norms, or basic human decency.

94
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,480
So at this point, there's still been no actual information

95
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,240
released by the Canadian police,

96
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,600
but that hasn't stopped Free Republic from having the whole incident figured out.

97
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
There were two shooters,

98
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,840
they were Syrian refugees called Bashir al-Tawhid and Hassan Matti,

99
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,480
they arrived in Canada last week,

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,920
and they carried out the killings as part of some sort of internal Islamic factional conflict.

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,520
Simple.

102
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
Now since this is all so obvious,

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
we can move on to the second step of our conspiracy theory creation process

104
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,960
by asking,

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,560
why is it taking the police so long to confirm all these things that we already know?

106
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Why haven't the police confirmed that the attacker was a Muslim?

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,080
You see, the next thing the police did was announce that they had two suspects in custody,

108
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,920
those being Alexandre Bissonnette, the actual shooter,

109
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,320
and Mohamed El-Kadhia, the witness,

110
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,640
but they hadn't yet announced their names.

111
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
And so, why not?

112
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,040
User Mandaledon says,

113
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,000
"...still not telling the public who the terrorists are,

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,640
which probably means they have Muslim names."

115
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,240
And user Major Pelham agrees,

116
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,280
saying that the delay on releasing the suspects' names is a dead giveaway at this point.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,280
User Kevin in California says,

118
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,840
"...no reports on them must mean they're not blonde slash blue-eyed."

119
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,320
And Desert Rhino says similar,

120
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,720
"...Trudo would use the label terrorist if it was a couple of white guys.

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,200
Three hours without a peep tells me they're trying to figure out how to spin this."

122
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,600
User Rommiechick gets right to the point and says,

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,320
"...can't be white, it would have already hit the news by the libtards."

124
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,480
JLB says,

125
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,360
"...for once I really thought it might be some religion

126
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,920
other than Muslims perpetrating the killings."

127
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,120
The perfect record continues.

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
Hmm.

129
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,920
Outside of Free Republic, this is where we start to see our pals over at Rebel Media chiming in.

130
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,520
Gavin McInnes, seen here doing something incredibly racist,

131
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,200
commented on an early report saying,

132
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,320
"...just need the shooter's first name please news."

133
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,720
Ezra Levant posted, and then I guess retweeted himself,

134
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,920
asking why there hadn't been any suspects' names released.

135
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,240
Then followed that up by saying,

136
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,840
"...Quebec police just said he won't name Muslim mosque attack suspects

137
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,000
because there are legal procedures."

138
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,540
Really?

139
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,920
Well, yes, really.

140
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,240
You see, Ezra, there's a few actual reasons that police are hesitant

141
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
to immediately release the names of people suspected of crimes,

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
regardless of their race or religion.

143
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,160
The first is a basic matter of public safety,

144
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
especially with high-profile incidents like this one.

145
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
You know, you can't come out and say,

146
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,680
"...we just arrested John Smith of Number 10 Kings Road for this terrible crime,

147
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,600
and by the way, here's a map to his house," for instance.

148
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,200
The next reason is so that police can protect themselves legally,

149
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,840
because what if it later turns out that John Smith didn't do the terrible crime

150
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,920
and didn't much like his name and face being out there in news stories,

151
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
calling him a murderer?

152
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
He'd have a pretty good defamation case there.

153
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
And it's honestly kind of surprising Ezra Levant wouldn't understand

154
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,200
the potential legal ramifications here,

155
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,680
considering how many times that he himself has been sued for libel,

156
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,560
several times having to publicly apologize and pay damages to people

157
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,320
he's been telling fibs about,

158
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
including a Mr. George Soros, funnily enough,

159
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,480
and I bet that apology particularly stunk, didn't it, Ezra?

160
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
Now, pretending to wonder why the police haven't released information

161
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,920
about the suspect in a shooting happens every time,

162
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
even though this incident, with a white, non-Islamic shooter,

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
should prove to everyone that the police always delay releasing the suspect's names,

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
regardless of ethnicity or religion.

165
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
It won't, though, you know?

166
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,480
Jumping to conclusions is just too fun,

167
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
and it's a favorite pastime of all manner of idiots.

168
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,680
Here's the perpetually outraged Paul Joseph Watson posting it,

169
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,040
and even Twitter egg come to life Stefan Molyneux couldn't resist retweeting someone else,

170
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,640
wondering the same.

171
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,880
Now, handily enough for me,

172
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,440
the rebel media guys were rather sloppy with their initial responses

173
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
and kind of gave the game away a bit.

174
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,040
Look at the language in Ezra Levant's tweet.

175
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,080
Police won't name the Muslim mosque attackers,

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,600
or Gavin McInnis, who reacted to news that a pig's head was left at the mosque last year

177
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,240
by saying,

178
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,800
"...pretty sure these Muslims would rather be offended by a Christian

179
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,960
than shot at by a Muslim."

180
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Which doesn't really make sense on any level,

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,480
but it is rather enlightening, you see.

182
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,280
Like the folks over at Free Republic,

183
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,560
rebel media has also already decided that the attackers were Muslims,

184
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,720
and that the police were therefore delaying releasing their names because...

185
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,960
something?

186
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,160
Because police are meant to really like Muslims?

187
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,620
I guess.

188
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,040
Now, adding fuel to the fire of these speculations is an early witness report

189
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,720
that cries of Allah Akbar were heard during the shooting.

190
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,160
That phrase, of course, being the thing that the bad guys shout on the TV

191
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,840
when they're being evil.

192
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,400
The rebel media crew all tweeted out the Allah Akbar report.

193
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,080
For example, his otherwise uninvolved, amazing, brainless woman, Lauren Southern,

194
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,960
chiming in with her obligatory tweet on the subject.

195
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,760
Now, after the name of the shooter...

196
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,400
And remember, what they're really asking when they're asking for the name of the shooter is,

197
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
what color was he?

198
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,380
Anyway.

199
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,640
After that, everyone always wants to know if the shooter shouted Allah Akbar,

200
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,160
which is, of course, the thing the baddies say in the movies,

201
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,400
and has no other meanings or applications at all.

202
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,000
Hi, kid.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,640
Of course.

204
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,120
So, the Allah Akbar witness report comes from CBC News in Canada,

205
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,440
who quoted an anonymous witness calling into Radio Canada

206
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,560
and saying that there were two gunmen with...

207
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,360
Look at that word right there.

208
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,080
Where am I gonna go with this one, do you reckon?

209
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm gonna say...

210
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,320
Quebecie.

211
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,720
With Quebecie accents, who both shouted Allah Akbar.

212
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
There's no identification of this witness,

213
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,280
who could literally be anyone calling in and saying any old nonsense,

214
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,920
but, barring that, even though they were wrong about the number of shooters,

215
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,080
they could have been right about hearing Allah Akbar be spoken.

216
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,600
They were apparently at a mosque during evening prayers.

217
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,000
So I think it'd be weird to not hear Allah Akbar be said,

218
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
because, of course, many Muslims say Allah Akbar for a variety of reasons.

219
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,160
It's not exclusively a terrorist phrase.

220
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,440
And even Bissonnette could have said it mockingly.

221
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,680
You know, it's not the automatic Islamic terrorist signifier

222
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
certain people seem to want it to be.

223
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,160
Free Republic user Civil War Brewing candidly shows us the real reason

224
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,880
that Allah Akbar gets such press by saying,

225
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,320
witnesses said he shouted Allah Akbar as he fired his AK-47.

226
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,760
Definitely a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant Trump supporter.

227
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,440
Now this anonymous witness account will be important to the later conspiracy theory,

228
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,200
as it will be continually brought up as unexplained.

229
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,440
Which is because the source was an anonymous witness

230
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,000
calling into a radio show one time, so, you know, whatever.

231
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,600
Anyway, let's move on a little in the timeline now

232
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,880
to the point where the Canadian police released the names of the two men they were holding.

233
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,360
And one Free Republic threat from this time is particularly notable,

234
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,600
because it's responding to an Associated Press article which says,

235
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,520
Quebec City court clerk Isabelle Fairland identified

236
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,160
Alexandre Bissonnette and Mohamed El-Kadhir as the suspects.

237
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,440
Police later said one of them was just a witness, though they did not say which.

238
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:04,400
Now, if I didn't know any better, I'd say this was a conscious attempt to set up Islamophobes.

239
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,760
For a fall, we are about to get into some wily coyote shit here.

240
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,960
We may need Sherlock Holmes to crack this case.

241
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,680
Ooh, ooh, I know which one.

242
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
Pick me, pick me.

243
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,560
Which means Alexandre Bissonnette was the witness,

244
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,200
and Mohamed El-Kadhir was the shooter.

245
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,720
Otherwise, we'd have been told immediately.

246
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,120
If they're holding back the information, it's more likely it's the Muslim.

247
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
The press doesn't protect white guys.

248
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,280
I know, I know.

249
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,840
Hardee-ha, they're all wrong.

250
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,680
Now, unfortunately, the laughs didn't last all that long,

251
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,880
as very shortly after that, the police revealed that it was, in fact, Mohamed El-Kadhir,

252
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,680
who was the witness, and Bissonnette the shooter.

253
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,360
Apparently having no consideration for how funny it would have been

254
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,560
to withhold that information for another day or so,

255
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,560
they have no sense of comic irony, the police.

256
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,640
For example, rebel media giant air quotes

257
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,960
correspondent Gavin McInnes was midway through making a video

258
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,560
about the fact that it was obviously the Muslim guy who did it,

259
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,800
which starts out like this.

260
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,280
What was it, the same day that Justin Trudeau,

261
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,920
the prime minister of Canada in one of his silly costumes,

262
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,000
I think he was dressed like a Chinaman that day,

263
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,800
says,

264
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,880
hey, refugees being rejected from America, come to Canada, we have room for you.

265
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
As he says that, shooting in a mosque.

266
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,800
And as with all shootings, we have one question.

267
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
As a Western culture, we say,

268
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,280
what was his first name, please?

269
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,520
Waiting, and it's Mohamed.

270
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,080
Okay.

271
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,600
But police released the witness before he could get it out there,

272
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,600
so he instead plays it off like the police media narrative is changing so fast we can't keep up.

273
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,840
All these new details keep coming out so fast we don't even have time to report on it.

274
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,360
You know, apparently missing the fact that he could just wait for the full story to be out.

275
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,160
So anyway, police released the Muslim witness

276
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,320
and declared that the white Canadian Bissonette is the only suspect,

277
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,440
which you might expect to be a bit of a knock to the Islamophobe narrative here.

278
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,440
But you'd be wrong.

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,880
We're not dealing with amateurs here, you know.

280
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,360
If the shooter turned out to be Bissonette, that in itself would indicate nothing.

281
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,400
We have several instances in Canada of non-Muslim born or raised converts,

282
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,200
sympathizers of radical Islam, committing acts of terrorism.

283
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,360
Nobody should assume that if Bissonette,

284
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,720
then white supremacist agenda is a valid paradigm.

285
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,240
Wait and see.

286
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,400
Wait and see.

287
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
Yeah, now it's a white guy.

288
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,760
We wait and see.

289
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,200
Probably a recent convert to Islam.

290
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,000
And I have heard reports agreeing with that.

291
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,920
Anyone can convert to Islam and be brainwashed.

292
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
It's an evil ideology.

293
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
Now the Islamic convert angle doesn't last long

294
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,480
in the light of emerging reports describing Bissonette

295
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,120
as a far-right-wing white nationalist type,

296
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,000
at which point you'd think the Islamophobes would just give this one up.

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
It's a lost cause.

298
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,200
Admit you were wrong, take the hit, and move on.

299
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,360
However, I smell something fishy.

300
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,160
Very suspect reporting to me.

301
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,440
I want more information about this incident.

302
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,040
Very fishy.

303
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,160
Everything is so fishy about this.

304
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,760
We just don't know enough about this case.

305
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,560
Yet.

306
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,080
If this story was about an Islamophobe shooting up the mosque,

307
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,720
we'd have heard all about it by now.

308
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,760
The truth doesn't need time or delay.

309
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,040
Something stinks.

310
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,480
Now this comment is really something special.

311
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,160
The exact same delay that was previously supposed to indicate a Muslim shooter

312
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,440
has been repurposed to now mean that it can't have been an Islamophobe shooter,

313
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
or we'd have already heard about it,

314
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,680
even though we are currently hearing about it.

315
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,320
And if we try and map out that statement logically,

316
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,560
I guess we get this didn't happen because this doesn't happen,

317
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,080
which is a pretty nifty all-purpose reality-defying argument there.

318
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,400
Our pals over at Rebel Media are also reluctant to give it up,

319
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,800
and hey, who can blame them?

320
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,760
If you set up the website Quebec Terror

321
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,640
and send a reporter and a cameraman to the scene to do a whole bunch of news reports

322
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,600
and get all your correspondence, spending their time contributing material about it,

323
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,400
and then the shooter turns out to not be a Muslim,

324
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
but actually a white Canadian who doesn't like Muslims,

325
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,600
like you,

326
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,520
you must be feeling pretty fucking stupid right now.

327
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,920
You were expecting to bag yourself a big, tasty Islamic terror story

328
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,080
to harp on about for the rest of the year,

329
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,360
and you instead wasted your time and money covering a story

330
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,400
that actually harms the narrative you want to spread.

331
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
So they're backed into a corner at this point, frankly.

332
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,520
They have to keep running with the idea that this was an act of Islamic terror,

333
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,720
which means they now have to argue that there was a cover-up

334
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
and the witness who was released was the actual shooter,

335
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,880
except they're not allowed to actually say that

336
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,520
because now it's libelous and they'll get sued.

337
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,760
So all they can do is flaccidly poke at it with the same tactic employed on freerepublic.com,

338
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,480
which is saying,

339
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,320
this is weird.

340
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,400
Isn't it, this story?

341
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,240
It's, uh, it's really weird.

342
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,840
Isn't it odd?

343
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,080
It's a bit fishy, you know?

344
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,400
It just, it doesn't add up.

345
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,960
Because this story is not even close to being done.

346
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,560
It's just, it's so curious.

347
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,560
Things here look weird.

348
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,480
That makes this super weird.

349
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,400
And that is not my conspiracy theories.

350
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
That's not my speculation.

351
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,080
That's me saying,

352
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,240
what happened there?

353
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,360
It's not conspiracy theory.

354
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,920
These are valid questions and I just don't get it.

355
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,880
Ezra, you know, we cover time and time again media party spin, etc.

356
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,960
But for me, I just don't get how we're really the only ones asking this.

357
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,680
It's so weird.

358
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,840
We're going to try our best to cover it from here.

359
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,120
I'd just like to highlight one segment of this particular video

360
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,440
that I can't pass up commenting on.

361
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,720
Let's take a watch.

362
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
I want to know more about the suspects.

363
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,560
I want to know more about the victims.

364
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,600
I want to know more about the suspect's family.

365
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,960
I want to know what drives a guy to go from zero to ten.

366
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
A guy who has no priors, who has absolutely is not known to police whatsoever,

367
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,800
did not post hateful things online.

368
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,920
As far as we know, we have one pro-refugees group telling us

369
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,160
that he was known to their Facebook group as being an anti-feminist, anti-refugee.

370
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,600
Really, where's the evidence?

371
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,920
So where's the evidence for Bissonnette being a right-wing Islamophobe?

372
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,080
All we've got is witnesses saying that it's true.

373
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,840
Much like another element of this story.

374
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,720
But I don't see rebel media asking for proof that Allah Akbar was sheltered.

375
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,960
An anonymous witness statement is good enough for them on that front,

376
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,680
but when multiple named witnesses claim that the guy was a far-right Islamophobe,

377
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,120
well, now we'd like to see some evidence, please.

378
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,680
Witnesses suddenly aren't good enough anymore

379
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,640
when they're saying things that we don't want to hear.

380
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,680
Anyway, so we've watched the narrative twist and turn

381
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,400
and shrug off consistent attacks by reality,

382
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,920
and frankly, anyone who's still on board with it by this point

383
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,600
is primed to believe in a conspiracy theory.

384
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,040
How could they not?

385
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,280
After coming so far, they're pot-committed to use a poker term.

386
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,640
I'd actually bet that quite a few of these people

387
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,560
aren't really all that committed to the false flag, cover-up,

388
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,880
conspiracy theory side of things.

389
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,280
This is more just an ideological saving of face.

390
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,480
It's a way to put a cap on the rather uncomfortable idea

391
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,320
that murderers can be any color or religion or nationality,

392
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,600
and can even be someone just like you.

393
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
It's hard to spot the bad guys when they could be anyone.

394
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,960
It's much easier if the Muslims are the bad guys.

395
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,880
They're typically easy to spot, if you catch my drift.

396
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,160
So, if the shooter's a Muslim, then that's the fault of the Muslims, obviously,

397
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,720
but if the shooter is a white Islamophobe,

398
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,320
then it's a false flag conspiracy to make Muslims look good,

399
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,400
and thus, still the fault of the Muslims.

400
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,080
Which is a perfect argument, you know, there's no countering that.

401
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,320
Now, before I go today, I'd just like to congratulate my old pal,

402
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,800
Kraut & T, and why is that?

403
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,240
Well, for this.

404
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,240
The attack in Quebec briefly seemed to gain wider media attention

405
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,080
and even less in our YouTube circles.

406
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,840
I have often warned of making foregone conclusions over terrorist attacks

407
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,440
when these are still happening,

408
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,280
and this seems to be the extent to which reporting on this attack was limited.

409
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,680
Brief announcements over Islamic terror,

410
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,440
and after the realization that it wasn't Islamic, silence.

411
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,200
So, well done, Katie, for so deftly avoiding the trap

412
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,600
that so many others fell into.

413
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,480
See, I give credit where credit's due, you know,

414
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,800
Katie said, wait and see, and he avoided making himself look stupid,

415
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,640
so, congratulations.

416
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,680
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching, everyone,

417
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,440
and thank you particularly to the names of the very kind people

418
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
that should be scrolling past right now.

419
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
Who are they, you might be wondering?

420
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,440
Well, they're my supporters over on Patreon,

421
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,800
which is a website that lets you give me a dollar, or whatever,

422
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,960
when I make a video.

423
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,120
Now, I don't know you,

424
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,240
but I'm imagining that you're currently feeling a sense of incredible jealousy

425
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
that your name is not on this list.

426
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,200
Well, that's an easy fix, isn't it?

427
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,000
Just head over to Patreon and press a few buttons,

428
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,920
and next time I put a video out, your name will be up there too.

429
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,280
I myself pledge to support a few content creators that I particularly enjoy,

430
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,200
and let me tell you, it's a thrilling experience, start to finish.

431
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
Thanks a lot, folks, and I'll see you next time.
