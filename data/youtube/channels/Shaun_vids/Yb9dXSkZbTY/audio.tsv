0	5920	Hello everyone. I'd like today to talk about the recent Quebec City mosque shooting,
5920	13440	and in particular the evolving response to it on a certain online community that I'm a big fan of.
13440	16880	So first we'll just give a brief overview of the event.
16880	23720	On the 29th of January, during the evening prayers at the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec City,
23880	31480	a lone gunman entered the premises and began firing at people, killing six, before fleeing.
31480	37160	One suspect was initially detained at the scene, but was later released after police determined
37160	41080	that he was just a bystander who's now considered a witness.
41080	45120	The actual shooter, and I know I'm gonna pronounce this wrong here,
45120	50120	Alexandre Bissonnette, that's probably as close as I'm gonna get,
50360	53640	called the police shortly after fleeing and surrendered,
53640	59640	and it later came to light that Bissonnette was a far-right, white nationalist Islamophobe.
59640	66760	So what I'd like to do today is map out the response to this incident as various aspects of it came to light,
66760	74480	and we'll be thinking in particular about how these sorts of incidents always give rise to various conspiracy theories.
74560	78240	And I'll be looking in particular at FreeRepublic.com,
78240	83920	which is a deeply conservative forum community that I dip into every now and then,
83920	86520	if I feel like being annoyed about something.
86520	92640	I'll also be looking at the response by the various faces of the YouTube channel Rebel Media,
92640	95520	who I briefly featured in my previous video.
95520	98440	And before I get started, a little disclaimer.
98440	102560	This isn't merely some victory lap about the shooting, you know.
102600	107760	All these people thought it was a Muslim shooter, but then it turned out it was an Islamophobe shooter.
108400	110400	Hardy-heart, they're all wrong.
110400	115360	You know, I'm not interested in just doing that, because after all, this is still a mass shooting,
115360	117520	and people died, and it's a tragedy.
118720	121600	There's an element of making fun of them, sure,
121600	127040	but I promise it's all in service to an actual point here that I think it's important to make.
127440	128960	And so, let's get to it.
129120	135120	We'll start at the beginning with the first breaking news reports being posted on FreeRepublic.com.
135600	139520	So, this thread is the first time the incident was mentioned on the forum,
139520	143360	and being an early report, it's very light on the details.
143360	148720	You know, multiple shots fired, people feared injured, police have set up a perimeter,
149280	154240	and naturally, there's no mention of the motive or identity of the suspect.
154640	158400	And here's where we take our first step on the road to our conspiracy theory.
158400	162080	The obvious Islamophobe reaction to news of a shooting
162080	164640	is to assume that the perpetrator is a Muslim.
165440	170720	This step is slightly complicated here, because the victims were also Muslims,
170720	175040	which means we have to do a little imaginative speculating.
175040	178400	An early comment from user TLI says,
178960	182800	"...multiple dead? Yeah, sounds internal.
182800	185680	Might have been more that one popped their cork,
185680	188320	perhaps two families went after each other?"
189200	194720	User AFoolInParadise postulates it may have been an honor killing,
194720	199840	and user Wendell is taking bets that the shooting arose from the conflict
199840	202240	between different denominations of Islam.
202960	205840	So it's clear the kind of thing that they're expecting.
206480	210000	Now, around this time, in a thread on Reddit about the incident,
210000	214240	a user called The underscore GMD posted this.
215040	217120	Confirmed on police radio.
217120	221840	The two suspects are Bashir al-Tawid and Hassan Matti,
221840	225520	Syrians who entered Canada as refugees last week.
226160	228640	Now, this isn't true.
228640	230880	This is just some rubbish someone made up,
230880	236800	but since it implicates Muslims, it of course caught on and did the rounds on Twitter
236800	239520	and made its way to Free Republic.
239520	244080	User NowApproachingMidnight reposted the fake names.
245120	249680	Now, they did charitably add the word unconfirmed at the start of their post.
250560	253520	Not that anyone appears to have read it, mind you.
254480	256560	User RedWolf replied,
256560	257920	"...and it's Muslims."
258720	262400	User Lazamataz posted a sarcastic reply,
262400	266320	mocking the idea that the shooter could have been a right-wing Canadian,
266320	270400	which of course, considering later developments, is rather funny.
270400	273680	User GoldStateGOP posted,
273680	274880	"...I'm not surprised.
275600	277920	Muzzies attacking fellow muzzies.
278480	280240	Justin Trudeau's children."
281360	284080	They really don't like Justin Trudeau, by the way.
284720	287040	User Littleharbour posted,
287600	291120	"...it's becoming apparent that this is a Muslim-on-Muslim attack."
291920	294480	Of course, there's absolutely no evidence so far
294480	298080	to support that the shooter or shooters were Muslims,
298080	302960	but so strong is this conservative, Islamophobe desire to blame a Muslim
302960	306480	that they've all already decided that it's the case.
306480	308880	User Van Schuyten comments that,
308880	314400	"...if it were refugees, this'll be good because of its political impact."
314400	317600	And this is echoed by user SouthernerFromTheNorth,
317600	319920	who says, "...it could be a game changer.
320560	323200	Refugees need to be stopped everywhere.
323920	326720	Can Trump rule for other countries too?"
328400	328900	Yikes.
329520	332720	User Aquila48 says,
332720	334640	"...what a gift they handed Trump."
335360	338640	And then they write some Trump Twitter fanfic
338640	341280	that has Trump gloating about the attacks.
342320	345360	And user Yardstick says,
345360	348880	"...frankly, the timing couldn't be better for Trump."
348880	351920	And this sort of thing is why I really like Free Republic.
351920	355840	There's no attempt to dull the edges of any of these horrible opinions.
355840	359840	They're just openly being happy about murders happening,
359840	362000	so long as it makes Trump look good.
362560	368480	Free Republic is like having a direct line into modern conservative thought,
368480	372160	completely unfettered by things like political correctness,
372160	376240	or societal norms, or basic human decency.
376880	380480	So at this point, there's still been no actual information
380560	382240	released by the Canadian police,
382240	387600	but that hasn't stopped Free Republic from having the whole incident figured out.
387600	389200	There were two shooters,
389200	393840	they were Syrian refugees called Bashir al-Tawhid and Hassan Matti,
393840	396480	they arrived in Canada last week,
396480	401920	and they carried out the killings as part of some sort of internal Islamic factional conflict.
402560	403520	Simple.
403520	405600	Now since this is all so obvious,
405600	410240	we can move on to the second step of our conspiracy theory creation process
410240	410960	by asking,
411680	416560	why is it taking the police so long to confirm all these things that we already know?
417520	421520	Why haven't the police confirmed that the attacker was a Muslim?
421520	426080	You see, the next thing the police did was announce that they had two suspects in custody,
426080	429920	those being Alexandre Bissonnette, the actual shooter,
429920	432320	and Mohamed El-Kadhia, the witness,
432320	434640	but they hadn't yet announced their names.
435360	437280	And so, why not?
437840	441040	User Mandaledon says,
441040	444000	"...still not telling the public who the terrorists are,
444000	446640	which probably means they have Muslim names."
447600	450240	And user Major Pelham agrees,
450240	455280	saying that the delay on releasing the suspects' names is a dead giveaway at this point.
456000	459280	User Kevin in California says,
459280	463840	"...no reports on them must mean they're not blonde slash blue-eyed."
463840	466320	And Desert Rhino says similar,
466320	470720	"...Trudo would use the label terrorist if it was a couple of white guys.
470720	475200	Three hours without a peep tells me they're trying to figure out how to spin this."
475920	479600	User Rommiechick gets right to the point and says,
479600	484320	"...can't be white, it would have already hit the news by the libtards."
484960	486480	JLB says,
486480	489360	"...for once I really thought it might be some religion
489360	491920	other than Muslims perpetrating the killings."
492480	495120	The perfect record continues.
496800	497840	Hmm.
497840	503920	Outside of Free Republic, this is where we start to see our pals over at Rebel Media chiming in.
504640	509520	Gavin McInnes, seen here doing something incredibly racist,
510400	513200	commented on an early report saying,
513200	516320	"...just need the shooter's first name please news."
516880	520720	Ezra Levant posted, and then I guess retweeted himself,
520720	523920	asking why there hadn't been any suspects' names released.
524720	526240	Then followed that up by saying,
526960	531840	"...Quebec police just said he won't name Muslim mosque attack suspects
531840	534000	because there are legal procedures."
535040	535540	Really?
536400	537920	Well, yes, really.
537920	542240	You see, Ezra, there's a few actual reasons that police are hesitant
542240	545440	to immediately release the names of people suspected of crimes,
546000	548560	regardless of their race or religion.
548560	552160	The first is a basic matter of public safety,
552160	555200	especially with high-profile incidents like this one.
555200	557120	You know, you can't come out and say,
557120	561680	"...we just arrested John Smith of Number 10 Kings Road for this terrible crime,
561680	565600	and by the way, here's a map to his house," for instance.
565600	569200	The next reason is so that police can protect themselves legally,
569200	573840	because what if it later turns out that John Smith didn't do the terrible crime
573840	577920	and didn't much like his name and face being out there in news stories,
577920	579440	calling him a murderer?
579440	582480	He'd have a pretty good defamation case there.
582480	586720	And it's honestly kind of surprising Ezra Levant wouldn't understand
586720	589200	the potential legal ramifications here,
589200	593680	considering how many times that he himself has been sued for libel,
593680	598560	several times having to publicly apologize and pay damages to people
598560	600320	he's been telling fibs about,
601040	604560	including a Mr. George Soros, funnily enough,
604560	608480	and I bet that apology particularly stunk, didn't it, Ezra?
609200	612800	Now, pretending to wonder why the police haven't released information
612800	615920	about the suspect in a shooting happens every time,
615920	620000	even though this incident, with a white, non-Islamic shooter,
620000	626000	should prove to everyone that the police always delay releasing the suspect's names,
626000	628800	regardless of ethnicity or religion.
629440	630800	It won't, though, you know?
631680	634480	Jumping to conclusions is just too fun,
634480	638800	and it's a favorite pastime of all manner of idiots.
638800	643680	Here's the perpetually outraged Paul Joseph Watson posting it,
643680	649040	and even Twitter egg come to life Stefan Molyneux couldn't resist retweeting someone else,
649600	650640	wondering the same.
651200	652880	Now, handily enough for me,
653600	657440	the rebel media guys were rather sloppy with their initial responses
657440	659440	and kind of gave the game away a bit.
660240	663040	Look at the language in Ezra Levant's tweet.
663040	666080	Police won't name the Muslim mosque attackers,
666080	671600	or Gavin McInnis, who reacted to news that a pig's head was left at the mosque last year
671600	672240	by saying,
672800	676800	"...pretty sure these Muslims would rather be offended by a Christian
676800	678960	than shot at by a Muslim."
679600	682000	Which doesn't really make sense on any level,
682000	684480	but it is rather enlightening, you see.
685040	687280	Like the folks over at Free Republic,
687280	692560	rebel media has also already decided that the attackers were Muslims,
693040	696720	and that the police were therefore delaying releasing their names because...
698400	698960	something?
699600	702160	Because police are meant to really like Muslims?
703120	703620	I guess.
704400	709040	Now, adding fuel to the fire of these speculations is an early witness report
709040	712720	that cries of Allah Akbar were heard during the shooting.
713520	718160	That phrase, of course, being the thing that the bad guys shout on the TV
718160	719840	when they're being evil.
719840	724400	The rebel media crew all tweeted out the Allah Akbar report.
724400	730080	For example, his otherwise uninvolved, amazing, brainless woman, Lauren Southern,
730080	732960	chiming in with her obligatory tweet on the subject.
733520	735760	Now, after the name of the shooter...
736800	740400	And remember, what they're really asking when they're asking for the name of the shooter is,
740960	742240	what color was he?
742880	743380	Anyway.
743920	748640	After that, everyone always wants to know if the shooter shouted Allah Akbar,
748640	752160	which is, of course, the thing the baddies say in the movies,
752160	756400	and has no other meanings or applications at all.
757200	758000	Hi, kid.
758000	758640	Of course.
758640	763120	So, the Allah Akbar witness report comes from CBC News in Canada,
763120	767440	who quoted an anonymous witness calling into Radio Canada
767440	770560	and saying that there were two gunmen with...
772160	773360	Look at that word right there.
774240	776080	Where am I gonna go with this one, do you reckon?
776080	776800	I'm gonna say...
777680	778320	Quebecie.
779840	784720	With Quebecie accents, who both shouted Allah Akbar.
785680	788560	There's no identification of this witness,
788560	793280	who could literally be anyone calling in and saying any old nonsense,
793280	797920	but, barring that, even though they were wrong about the number of shooters,
797920	802080	they could have been right about hearing Allah Akbar be spoken.
802080	805600	They were apparently at a mosque during evening prayers.
806080	810000	So I think it'd be weird to not hear Allah Akbar be said,
810800	814800	because, of course, many Muslims say Allah Akbar for a variety of reasons.
814800	818160	It's not exclusively a terrorist phrase.
818160	821440	And even Bissonnette could have said it mockingly.
821440	825680	You know, it's not the automatic Islamic terrorist signifier
825680	828160	certain people seem to want it to be.
828800	834160	Free Republic user Civil War Brewing candidly shows us the real reason
834240	836880	that Allah Akbar gets such press by saying,
838000	842320	witnesses said he shouted Allah Akbar as he fired his AK-47.
843200	847760	Definitely a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant Trump supporter.
848320	853440	Now this anonymous witness account will be important to the later conspiracy theory,
853440	857200	as it will be continually brought up as unexplained.
858560	861440	Which is because the source was an anonymous witness
861440	866000	calling into a radio show one time, so, you know, whatever.
866720	869600	Anyway, let's move on a little in the timeline now
869600	874880	to the point where the Canadian police released the names of the two men they were holding.
874880	879360	And one Free Republic threat from this time is particularly notable,
879360	883600	because it's responding to an Associated Press article which says,
883680	887520	Quebec City court clerk Isabelle Fairland identified
887520	892160	Alexandre Bissonnette and Mohamed El-Kadhir as the suspects.
892160	897440	Police later said one of them was just a witness, though they did not say which.
898080	904400	Now, if I didn't know any better, I'd say this was a conscious attempt to set up Islamophobes.
904400	909760	For a fall, we are about to get into some wily coyote shit here.
909760	912960	We may need Sherlock Holmes to crack this case.
913600	915680	Ooh, ooh, I know which one.
915680	917040	Pick me, pick me.
917600	920560	Which means Alexandre Bissonnette was the witness,
920560	923200	and Mohamed El-Kadhir was the shooter.
923200	926720	Otherwise, we'd have been told immediately.
926720	931120	If they're holding back the information, it's more likely it's the Muslim.
931120	933680	The press doesn't protect white guys.
934320	935280	I know, I know.
936080	937840	Hardee-ha, they're all wrong.
938400	941680	Now, unfortunately, the laughs didn't last all that long,
941680	946880	as very shortly after that, the police revealed that it was, in fact, Mohamed El-Kadhir,
946880	949680	who was the witness, and Bissonnette the shooter.
949680	953360	Apparently having no consideration for how funny it would have been
953360	956560	to withhold that information for another day or so,
957120	960560	they have no sense of comic irony, the police.
961120	964640	For example, rebel media giant air quotes
964640	968960	correspondent Gavin McInnes was midway through making a video
968960	972560	about the fact that it was obviously the Muslim guy who did it,
973280	974800	which starts out like this.
976240	979280	What was it, the same day that Justin Trudeau,
979280	981920	the prime minister of Canada in one of his silly costumes,
981920	984000	I think he was dressed like a Chinaman that day,
984000	984800	says,
984800	988880	hey, refugees being rejected from America, come to Canada, we have room for you.
989440	992320	As he says that, shooting in a mosque.
992960	996800	And as with all shootings, we have one question.
996800	998800	As a Western culture, we say,
999440	1001280	what was his first name, please?
1001280	1003520	Waiting, and it's Mohamed.
1003520	1004080	Okay.
1004080	1007600	But police released the witness before he could get it out there,
1007600	1013600	so he instead plays it off like the police media narrative is changing so fast we can't keep up.
1014320	1019840	All these new details keep coming out so fast we don't even have time to report on it.
1019840	1025360	You know, apparently missing the fact that he could just wait for the full story to be out.
1025360	1028160	So anyway, police released the Muslim witness
1028160	1032320	and declared that the white Canadian Bissonette is the only suspect,
1032880	1037440	which you might expect to be a bit of a knock to the Islamophobe narrative here.
1038320	1039440	But you'd be wrong.
1040000	1042880	We're not dealing with amateurs here, you know.
1042880	1047360	If the shooter turned out to be Bissonette, that in itself would indicate nothing.
1047360	1052400	We have several instances in Canada of non-Muslim born or raised converts,
1052400	1057200	sympathizers of radical Islam, committing acts of terrorism.
1057200	1059360	Nobody should assume that if Bissonette,
1059360	1062720	then white supremacist agenda is a valid paradigm.
1063360	1064240	Wait and see.
1065520	1066400	Wait and see.
1066400	1068720	Yeah, now it's a white guy.
1068720	1069760	We wait and see.
1070320	1073200	Probably a recent convert to Islam.
1073200	1076000	And I have heard reports agreeing with that.
1076800	1079920	Anyone can convert to Islam and be brainwashed.
1079920	1081920	It's an evil ideology.
1082400	1085520	Now the Islamic convert angle doesn't last long
1085520	1088480	in the light of emerging reports describing Bissonette
1088480	1091120	as a far-right-wing white nationalist type,
1091760	1096000	at which point you'd think the Islamophobes would just give this one up.
1096000	1097440	It's a lost cause.
1097440	1101200	Admit you were wrong, take the hit, and move on.
1102560	1105360	However, I smell something fishy.
1105920	1108160	Very suspect reporting to me.
1108800	1111440	I want more information about this incident.
1112000	1113040	Very fishy.
1113840	1116160	Everything is so fishy about this.
1116880	1119760	We just don't know enough about this case.
1119760	1120560	Yet.
1120560	1124080	If this story was about an Islamophobe shooting up the mosque,
1124080	1126720	we'd have heard all about it by now.
1126720	1129760	The truth doesn't need time or delay.
1129760	1131040	Something stinks.
1131600	1134480	Now this comment is really something special.
1134480	1140160	The exact same delay that was previously supposed to indicate a Muslim shooter
1140160	1145440	has been repurposed to now mean that it can't have been an Islamophobe shooter,
1145440	1147440	or we'd have already heard about it,
1148480	1151680	even though we are currently hearing about it.
1151680	1154320	And if we try and map out that statement logically,
1154320	1158560	I guess we get this didn't happen because this doesn't happen,
1158560	1164080	which is a pretty nifty all-purpose reality-defying argument there.
1164080	1168400	Our pals over at Rebel Media are also reluctant to give it up,
1168400	1170800	and hey, who can blame them?
1170800	1173760	If you set up the website Quebec Terror
1173760	1178640	and send a reporter and a cameraman to the scene to do a whole bunch of news reports
1178640	1183600	and get all your correspondence, spending their time contributing material about it,
1183600	1186400	and then the shooter turns out to not be a Muslim,
1186400	1190080	but actually a white Canadian who doesn't like Muslims,
1190880	1191600	like you,
1192320	1195520	you must be feeling pretty fucking stupid right now.
1195520	1199920	You were expecting to bag yourself a big, tasty Islamic terror story
1199920	1202080	to harp on about for the rest of the year,
1202080	1205360	and you instead wasted your time and money covering a story
1205360	1208400	that actually harms the narrative you want to spread.
1208400	1211200	So they're backed into a corner at this point, frankly.
1211200	1215520	They have to keep running with the idea that this was an act of Islamic terror,
1215520	1218720	which means they now have to argue that there was a cover-up
1218720	1222000	and the witness who was released was the actual shooter,
1222000	1224880	except they're not allowed to actually say that
1224960	1227520	because now it's libelous and they'll get sued.
1228080	1233760	So all they can do is flaccidly poke at it with the same tactic employed on freerepublic.com,
1233760	1234480	which is saying,
1235440	1236320	this is weird.
1236960	1238400	Isn't it, this story?
1238400	1240240	It's, uh, it's really weird.
1241040	1241840	Isn't it odd?
1242720	1244080	It's a bit fishy, you know?
1244080	1246400	It just, it doesn't add up.
1246400	1248960	Because this story is not even close to being done.
1248960	1250560	It's just, it's so curious.
1251200	1252560	Things here look weird.
1252560	1254480	That makes this super weird.
1254480	1256400	And that is not my conspiracy theories.
1256400	1257360	That's not my speculation.
1257360	1258080	That's me saying,
1259040	1260240	what happened there?
1260240	1261360	It's not conspiracy theory.
1261360	1263920	These are valid questions and I just don't get it.
1263920	1266880	Ezra, you know, we cover time and time again media party spin, etc.
1266880	1270960	But for me, I just don't get how we're really the only ones asking this.
1270960	1271680	It's so weird.
1271680	1273840	We're going to try our best to cover it from here.
1273840	1277120	I'd just like to highlight one segment of this particular video
1277120	1279440	that I can't pass up commenting on.
1279440	1280720	Let's take a watch.
1280720	1282720	I want to know more about the suspects.
1282720	1284560	I want to know more about the victims.
1284560	1287600	I want to know more about the suspect's family.
1287600	1290960	I want to know what drives a guy to go from zero to ten.
1290960	1294960	A guy who has no priors, who has absolutely is not known to police whatsoever,
1294960	1296800	did not post hateful things online.
1296800	1299920	As far as we know, we have one pro-refugees group telling us
1299920	1304160	that he was known to their Facebook group as being an anti-feminist, anti-refugee.
1304160	1305600	Really, where's the evidence?
1305600	1309920	So where's the evidence for Bissonnette being a right-wing Islamophobe?
1309920	1314080	All we've got is witnesses saying that it's true.
1314880	1317840	Much like another element of this story.
1317840	1322720	But I don't see rebel media asking for proof that Allah Akbar was sheltered.
1322720	1326960	An anonymous witness statement is good enough for them on that front,
1326960	1331680	but when multiple named witnesses claim that the guy was a far-right Islamophobe,
1331680	1335120	well, now we'd like to see some evidence, please.
1335120	1337680	Witnesses suddenly aren't good enough anymore
1337680	1340640	when they're saying things that we don't want to hear.
1340640	1343680	Anyway, so we've watched the narrative twist and turn
1343680	1346400	and shrug off consistent attacks by reality,
1346400	1349920	and frankly, anyone who's still on board with it by this point
1349920	1353600	is primed to believe in a conspiracy theory.
1353600	1355040	How could they not?
1355040	1359280	After coming so far, they're pot-committed to use a poker term.
1359920	1362640	I'd actually bet that quite a few of these people
1362640	1366560	aren't really all that committed to the false flag, cover-up,
1366560	1368880	conspiracy theory side of things.
1368880	1373280	This is more just an ideological saving of face.
1373280	1376480	It's a way to put a cap on the rather uncomfortable idea
1376480	1380320	that murderers can be any color or religion or nationality,
1380320	1383600	and can even be someone just like you.
1383600	1387600	It's hard to spot the bad guys when they could be anyone.
1387600	1390960	It's much easier if the Muslims are the bad guys.
1390960	1394880	They're typically easy to spot, if you catch my drift.
1394880	1400160	So, if the shooter's a Muslim, then that's the fault of the Muslims, obviously,
1400160	1402720	but if the shooter is a white Islamophobe,
1402720	1406320	then it's a false flag conspiracy to make Muslims look good,
1406960	1410400	and thus, still the fault of the Muslims.
1410400	1414080	Which is a perfect argument, you know, there's no countering that.
1414080	1418320	Now, before I go today, I'd just like to congratulate my old pal,
1418320	1420800	Kraut & T, and why is that?
1420800	1422240	Well, for this.
1422240	1426240	The attack in Quebec briefly seemed to gain wider media attention
1426240	1428080	and even less in our YouTube circles.
1428080	1431840	I have often warned of making foregone conclusions over terrorist attacks
1431840	1433440	when these are still happening,
1433440	1437280	and this seems to be the extent to which reporting on this attack was limited.
1437280	1439680	Brief announcements over Islamic terror,
1439680	1443440	and after the realization that it wasn't Islamic, silence.
1443440	1447200	So, well done, Katie, for so deftly avoiding the trap
1447200	1449600	that so many others fell into.
1449600	1452480	See, I give credit where credit's due, you know,
1452480	1456800	Katie said, wait and see, and he avoided making himself look stupid,
1456800	1458640	so, congratulations.
1459200	1461680	Anyway, thanks a lot for watching, everyone,
1461680	1465440	and thank you particularly to the names of the very kind people
1465440	1467440	that should be scrolling past right now.
1468080	1470080	Who are they, you might be wondering?
1470080	1473440	Well, they're my supporters over on Patreon,
1473440	1476800	which is a website that lets you give me a dollar, or whatever,
1477280	1478960	when I make a video.
1478960	1481120	Now, I don't know you,
1481680	1486240	but I'm imagining that you're currently feeling a sense of incredible jealousy
1486240	1488240	that your name is not on this list.
1488240	1491200	Well, that's an easy fix, isn't it?
1491200	1494000	Just head over to Patreon and press a few buttons,
1494000	1497920	and next time I put a video out, your name will be up there too.
1498480	1503280	I myself pledge to support a few content creators that I particularly enjoy,
1503280	1507200	and let me tell you, it's a thrilling experience, start to finish.
1507760	1510480	Thanks a lot, folks, and I'll see you next time.
