00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,160
On the 28th of July, journalist and author Laurie Penny shared a tweet thread

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,040
critical of transphobic hate group the LGB Alliance for sharing explicitly antisemitic material.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,200
Laurie Penny refers to this as the intersection of antisemitism and transmisogyny.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,560
Now, fantasy and sci-fi author Neil Gaiman responded to this tweet by saying,

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,320
And he's right, it isn't.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,000
You know, if the sole reason an organization exists is to be bigoted towards one group,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,240
it isn't very surprising that they'd also be bigoted towards another group.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,360
Gaiman's comment, of course, saw dozens of angry, outraged replies from transphobes

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,480
accusing him of all sorts of silly things,

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,760
one of whom speculated that Gaiman's friend and co-author, the late Terry Pratchett,

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,280
must have been behind the good parts of Gaiman's writing.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,160
And this set off some discussion about what Terry Pratchett would think about the trans

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,880
enormous air quotes debate if he were still alive today.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,800
Now, I like the one user here who says Margaret Atwood's support for trans people was a shock,

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,640
which seems very bizarre.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,600
Atwood's best-known work is set in a dystopia where womanhood is strictly tied

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
to the functioning of female reproductive systems,

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,120
handmaids who can't get pregnant are considered to be un-women.

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,160
You know, what were they expecting here after reading that?

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,520
Maybe they thought it was a utopian novel, who knows?

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,560
Anyway, on the 31st of July,

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,720
Rhianna Pratchett, daughter of Terry Pratchett, weighed in by responding to the following tweet.

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,840
I note that having not got over Atwood's betrayal, the GCs, GC standing for gender critical there,

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
are trying to recruit Terry Pratchett posthumously,

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,080
presumably because they know he can't contradict them.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,760
And Rhianna Pratchett says,

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,200
And Neil Gaiman expressed support for this tweet in another of his own.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,160
So the battle lines are drawn over what Terry Pratchett would think.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,760
On the one hand, we have his close friends and family members,

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,600
and on the other we have some random transphobes on Twitter.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,760
I wonder who's going to have the more accurate assessment of his character.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
There's just no way to know.

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,240
And it sounds absurd, but journalist, I suppose,

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,280
Sarah Dittom took this exact line of argument in an article for the Times titled

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,640
You Can't Hijack the Dead for Today's Battles.

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,760
It's absurd for either trans activists or gender critical feminists to claim

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,160
that Terry Pratchett would have supported them.

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,480
So Dittom relays the argument, including Rhianna Pratchett's statement on the issue,

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,400
which should be the end of it, really, before going on to say,

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,680
But some other people probably think Pratchett might have been a transphobe,

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
so who knows? There's just no way to know.

43
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
Now, my favorite part of this article is the following passage.

44
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,320
Now, this is a particularly weird comparison, isn't it?

45
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,240
Woodhouse died in 1975, and Jane Austen died in 1817,

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,240
whereas Terry Pratchett died six years ago.

47
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,080
Unless Dittom is claiming that trans people only became a thing within the last couple of years,

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,360
this insisting that Pratchett couldn't have possibly had any opinions on trans issues

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
is truly bizarre.

50
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,240
Now, if the gender critical crowd had anything at all here,

51
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,400
anything to go on that suggests that Pratchett would have been on their side,

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,480
they would be on the attack right now.

53
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,480
They're not usually known for their timidity in such matters.

54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,840
Sarah Dittom's both sides are wrong position is actually a hasty retreat.

55
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,400
It's a signal to please stop pushing the Terry Pratchett thing because it's a losing battle for us.

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
The transphobes accidentally opened up a losing front.

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,280
Pratchett was an immensely popular author.

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,080
Lots of famous people knew him personally.

59
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,080
There's stories being posted about his support for trans people.

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,000
His family and colleagues are stating he was not a transphobe,

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,560
and there's been a surge of interest in the trans themes in his novels.

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
So now Sarah Dittom is hastily like,

63
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
Oh no, less of that, please.

64
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,440
Terry Pratchett's been dead for like 200 years or something, right?

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Let's stop with all this wild speculation.

66
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,160
Now, I confess I am not actually all that interested

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,960
in the non-debate over what Terry Pratchett would think if he were alive.

68
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,720
Firstly, because obviously people who knew him and worked with him

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,760
are gonna have much more insight into what he would think

70
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,400
than some random bigots on Twitter.

71
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,440
But mainly, I'm not all that interested because Terry Pratchett was a prolific author

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,920
who wrote thousands upon thousands of words in dozens of books.

73
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,560
So if we want to know his opinions about something,

74
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,160
we could just take his daughter's advice and read the books.

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,480
Now, if someone were to ask me if I were a big fan of Discworld,

76
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,360
I would answer that I'm six foot two and around 260 pounds.

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,200
Because that's my joke I do when people ask me if I'm a big fan of something.

78
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,240
But yes, I've read almost all the Discworld books, some multiple times.

79
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,280
I liked them a lot.

80
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,200
And if you've never read them, I would enthusiastically recommend you check them out.

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,640
Anyway, as a self-professed Discworld expert here,

82
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,440
please allow me to waffle about it for a bit.

83
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,360
So, something you see come up again and again in the Discworld series

84
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,480
are characters who are supposed to act one way,

85
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,720
whether that's to conform with social, political, or religious norms,

86
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,080
or even to conform to the sort of role someone like them is expected to play in a story,

87
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,200
finding themselves wanting to act another way

88
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,520
and being true to themselves despite the role they're expected to play.

89
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
And this goes all the way to the series' roots.

90
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
The third book in the series, Equal Rights Hardy Heart,

91
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,120
is about the Discworld's first female wizard.

92
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
You know, girls are supposed to be witches, of course,

93
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
and boys are supposed to be wizards,

94
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,760
but this girl is a wizard, and what does that mean?

95
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,160
The witches' series of books is frequently concerned with the role

96
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
that witches are supposed to play in stories,

97
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,960
and how the characters conform to or defy those archetypes

98
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,440
is often a large part of the narrative.

99
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,400
And we see the same process on a larger scale for the Discworld's social groups.

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,080
The principal setting of the books, the city of Ankh-Morpork,

101
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,400
is a melting pot of the world's various races and cultures,

102
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,280
all of which have stereotypes for and expectations of the other groups.

103
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,800
Speciesism is the Disc's analogue for our racism

104
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,760
and is most often explored in the City Watch books,

105
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,640
where self-professed speciesist Sam Vimes has to oversee adding dwarves,

106
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,360
werewolves, vampires, trolls, and so on to the ranks of the City Watch.

107
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
And how all these different groups, with their histories of killing and oppressing

108
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,680
and often eating each other, learn to live alongside one another is an ongoing theme.

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,040
Also important is how these groups think of themselves,

110
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,160
how they expect members of their own group to act,

111
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,200
and how that interacts with their cultures and identities

112
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,040
being absorbed into the dominant culture of the big city.

113
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,040
So, with all that in mind, the Discworld's dwarves.

114
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,400
Now, much of the discussion about Pratchett's opinion of trans people

115
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
is focused on his dwarf characters,

116
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,280
and specifically a dwarf from the Watch series, Corporal Littlebottom,

117
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,640
which is a wonderful name.

118
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,200
So Discworld's dwarves, poking a bit of fun at Tolkien's dwarves,

119
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,440
typically all present as men,

120
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,160
with what sex a dwarf actually is being considered a private affair,

121
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,800
sort of a don't ask, don't tell system,

122
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,320
except with regard to sex rather than sexuality.

123
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,040
Anyway, Corporal Littlebottom decides to live openly as a woman,

124
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,840
coming out as being a woman, basically,

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,200
which obviously is not hard at all to read as an analogy

126
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,720
for the experiences of trans people in our world.

127
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,120
Now, as with many other of Pratchett's characters who break with traditions,

128
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160
it is to some degree played for laughs, right?

129
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,800
Corporal Littlebottom retains her beard,

130
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,320
and the heels on her boots are made of iron, for instance,

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,800
but the humor is not presented in a way that is cruel or unaccommodating

132
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
to the character herself.

133
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,240
She is never presented as having done anything wrong,

134
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,000
merely unexpected,

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,320
and the humor comes from the subversion of that expectation, basically.

136
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,920
It isn't malicious.

137
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,720
Pratchett finds humor in all manner of topics considered sensitive.

138
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,280
Race, sex, gender, and so on,

139
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,720
the sorts of things that unfunny stand-up comedians bemoan

140
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
you can't joke about anymore.

141
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,640
And he's able to do so firstly because he doesn't punch down,

142
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,240
but also because he doesn't just use issues like that for laughs.

143
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,320
He treats them as seriously as their real-world counterparts.

144
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,960
Dwarves who live openly as women in the Discworld are subject to discrimination.

145
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,720
There are slurs for them.

146
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
There are religious fundamentalist underground dwarven groups

147
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,520
who think the surface-dwelling dwarves have been corrupted by modern society and so on.

148
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,760
And the novel The Fifth Elephant features the possibility of a civil war

149
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120
between traditionalist and progressive dwarf groups.

150
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,440
So we have a social expectation for certain people,

151
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,280
or dwarves in this case,

152
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,440
to act like their society's idea of a certain gender.

153
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,200
And we have social repercussions for individuals who go against those expectations.

154
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,440
And Pratchett's sympathies are pretty obviously with the progressives

155
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
over the bigoted traditionalists.

156
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,240
In response to one of Neil Gaiman's tweets supporting Rhianna Pratchett,

157
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,800
someone responded with the following post.

158
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,520
And Gaiman responded that in 2010 or so,

159
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,280
Pratchett told him that he was proud that trans people saw themselves in his dwarves.

160
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,320
Now, it just wasn't a thing on anyone's radar.

161
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,720
It's reminiscent of Sarah Dittom's claim

162
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,080
that the dead cannot be measured by the standards of a world in which they never lived.

163
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,480
You know, they're trying to make it seem as if trans people

164
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,920
just popped into existence in the last couple of years here.

165
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,240
Now, I take issue with this, of course.

166
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,840
Not just because to read Pratchett's dwarves as being in no way a commentary on trans issues

167
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,880
requires a significant mental stretch,

168
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,960
and not just because people insisting to Pratchett's daughter and co-author

169
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,680
that they know more about what the man's opinions would be than they do is ridiculous,

170
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,680
but because nobody's talking about Monstress Regiment.

171
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,600
Now, Monstress Regiment is another Discworld novel by Pratchett

172
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
that contains an even more obvious trans...

173
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,600
Well, not analogy, really, just straight up what we would consider a trans character.

174
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,040
So, spoilers for Monstress Regiment here, obviously.

175
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,920
It's a good book, like most of the Discworld novels,

176
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
and I'd recommend reading it.

177
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,960
And if you want to read it unspoiled, goodbye, basically,

178
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,160
because from here on out, I'll be talking about the whole plot.

179
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
So, Monstress Regiment starts out as a Mulan-like story

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,840
in which a young woman, Polly Perks, disguises herself as a man

181
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,560
and enters military service during wartime

182
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,080
in order to track down her brother, who's missing in action.

183
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,760
Polly's country, Borogravia, is deeply conservative

184
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,240
and considers things like women joining the army

185
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,880
or dressing in men's clothes to be abominations unto their god.

186
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,080
So, Polly blasphemously enlists in the military

187
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,160
and is placed in a regiment of supposedly male soldiers who,

188
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,040
over the course of the novel, are revealed one by one

189
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,800
to also be women who join the military disguised as men,

190
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,400
all of whom with their own individual reason for doing so.

191
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,600
A whole regiment of Mulans, basically.

192
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
One of them is pregnant and searching for the father.

193
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,920
When one of a pair of particularly close recruits

194
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,160
is discovered by Polly to be a woman,

195
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,600
she assumes she joined the military to follow her man,

196
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,560
except the man in question is also later revealed to be a woman.

197
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,440
And this confuses Polly, who is chided for her sheltered lack of imagination

198
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
by the regiment's vampire recruit, Maledict,

199
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
who, of course, is later revealed to be Maledict-ah.

200
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,040
They're all women, is the joke, and it's a good joke, it's funny.

201
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,600
And, of course, they go on to have an adventure

202
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,480
and bring an end to the war and all that.

203
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
But that's not that important for us today.

204
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,280
What I want to focus on is pronouns.

205
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,960
Because how Pratchett uses pronouns here is important,

206
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,440
obviously, given the nature of the story.

207
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,400
And when gendering the characters, the narrative follows the perspective of Polly.

208
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,200
So when Polly thinks a character is a man, the narration refers to them as he-him.

209
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,760
But as Polly discovers they are in disguise,

210
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,280
the narration changes to refer to them as she-her.

211
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,600
So it's Polly's understanding that is guiding the narrator and the reader

212
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,160
in how characters should be gendered.

213
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,280
So with that in mind, the leader of the regiment

214
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,280
is an old, experienced soldier named Sergeant Jackram.

215
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,960
And at the conclusion of the story, Polly suspects that he, too,

216
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,520
joined the military as a woman and has spent decades living as a man

217
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,960
and asks him about it.

218
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,680
Now, at the start of the conversation, Jackram is still referred to as he.

219
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,080
He stirred into his beer, he unfastened the locket and so on.

220
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,560
As he tells his story to Polly, however,

221
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,680
a story of him following his lover to war,

222
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,240
Jackram follows the pattern of the other characters

223
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
and becomes a she in the narration.

224
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
She began very carefully to transfer the chewing tobacco.

225
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,960
This happens even though Jackram himself still refers to himself as a man in his speech.

226
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,240
I'm my own man, always have been, he says.

227
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,440
So Polly and Jackram discuss what Jackram is going to do now that the war is over.

228
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,680
Jackram has a son he's never met,

229
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,200
but expresses discomfort and embarrassment at the idea of turning up as his mother,

230
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,720
to which Polly says,

231
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:32,800
Now, with the end of the war and Jackram retiring from the army,

232
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,920
there's no legal reason that he would need to pretend to be a man anymore.

233
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,680
Continuing to live as a man would be for no other reason than because he wants to do it,

234
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,160
because that's how he is more comfortable being perceived.

235
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,880
And as Jackram is considering this idea, an interesting thing happens.

236
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Jackram's pronouns in the narration change back.

237
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,040
Polly paused when she got to the door.

238
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,120
Jackram had turned her chair to the fire and had settled back.

239
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,000
Around him, the kitchen worked.

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,200
Now, in pitching the idea to keep living as a man,

241
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,040
Polly frames it for Jackram as a bit of cheeky deception.

242
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,720
You know, the act of a trickster merely deciding to keep the act up.

243
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,440
Now, whether she actually believes this,

244
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,480
or whether she thinks it's just the best way to get Jackram to consider what she's saying,

245
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
is up to the reader here.

246
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But the narration knows the truth.

247
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,480
Jackram isn't a woman pretending to be a man at this point.

248
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
He's just a man.

249
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,520
In the epilogue of the story, Polly receives a message from Jackram

250
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,680
with a photograph of him as a man united with his son's family,

251
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,880
which is nice,

252
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,080
and Polly becomes a sergeant in the reformed military that now admits women.

253
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,080
And the novel ends with her meeting a pair of prospective army recruits,

254
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,440
who are, of course, women disguised as men,

255
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,240
and Polly tells the recruits that they're free to join as men if they like,

256
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
saying it's up to them.

257
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,720
And that's how Monstrous Regiment ends.

258
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,160
The conclusion of the story is a positive affirmation of self-identification,

259
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,760
and this novel was first published in 2003.

260
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,240
The idea that Terry Pratchett lived in a world

261
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,960
where trans issues were not a thing on anyone's radar is clearly not true.

262
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,640
I mean, obviously, but, you know, there you go.

263
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,320
I proved it, anyway.

264
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,960
