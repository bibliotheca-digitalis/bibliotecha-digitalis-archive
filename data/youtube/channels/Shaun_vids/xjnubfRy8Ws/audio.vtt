00:00.000 --> 00:01.360
Hello, everyone.

00:01.360 --> 00:06.160
On the 28th of July, journalist and author Laurie Penny shared a tweet thread

00:06.160 --> 00:13.040
critical of transphobic hate group the LGB Alliance for sharing explicitly antisemitic material.

00:13.040 --> 00:19.200
Laurie Penny refers to this as the intersection of antisemitism and transmisogyny.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.560
Now, fantasy and sci-fi author Neil Gaiman responded to this tweet by saying,

00:25.520 --> 00:28.320
And he's right, it isn't.

00:28.320 --> 00:34.000
You know, if the sole reason an organization exists is to be bigoted towards one group,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.240
it isn't very surprising that they'd also be bigoted towards another group.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.360
Gaiman's comment, of course, saw dozens of angry, outraged replies from transphobes

00:43.360 --> 00:46.480
accusing him of all sorts of silly things,

00:46.480 --> 00:51.760
one of whom speculated that Gaiman's friend and co-author, the late Terry Pratchett,

00:51.760 --> 00:55.280
must have been behind the good parts of Gaiman's writing.

00:55.280 --> 01:00.160
And this set off some discussion about what Terry Pratchett would think about the trans

01:00.160 --> 01:04.880
enormous air quotes debate if he were still alive today.

01:04.880 --> 01:10.800
Now, I like the one user here who says Margaret Atwood's support for trans people was a shock,

01:10.800 --> 01:12.640
which seems very bizarre.

01:12.640 --> 01:17.600
Atwood's best-known work is set in a dystopia where womanhood is strictly tied

01:17.600 --> 01:20.880
to the functioning of female reproductive systems,

01:20.960 --> 01:25.120
handmaids who can't get pregnant are considered to be un-women.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.160
You know, what were they expecting here after reading that?

01:28.160 --> 01:31.520
Maybe they thought it was a utopian novel, who knows?

01:32.080 --> 01:34.560
Anyway, on the 31st of July,

01:34.560 --> 01:40.720
Rhianna Pratchett, daughter of Terry Pratchett, weighed in by responding to the following tweet.

01:40.720 --> 01:47.840
I note that having not got over Atwood's betrayal, the GCs, GC standing for gender critical there,

01:47.840 --> 01:50.880
are trying to recruit Terry Pratchett posthumously,

01:50.880 --> 01:54.080
presumably because they know he can't contradict them.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.760
And Rhianna Pratchett says,

02:02.960 --> 02:07.200
And Neil Gaiman expressed support for this tweet in another of his own.

02:07.760 --> 02:12.160
So the battle lines are drawn over what Terry Pratchett would think.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.760
On the one hand, we have his close friends and family members,

02:15.760 --> 02:19.600
and on the other we have some random transphobes on Twitter.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.760
I wonder who's going to have the more accurate assessment of his character.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.760
There's just no way to know.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.240
And it sounds absurd, but journalist, I suppose,

02:30.240 --> 02:35.280
Sarah Dittom took this exact line of argument in an article for the Times titled

02:35.280 --> 02:38.640
You Can't Hijack the Dead for Today's Battles.

02:38.640 --> 02:43.760
It's absurd for either trans activists or gender critical feminists to claim

02:43.760 --> 02:46.160
that Terry Pratchett would have supported them.

03:01.200 --> 03:06.480
So Dittom relays the argument, including Rhianna Pratchett's statement on the issue,

03:06.480 --> 03:10.400
which should be the end of it, really, before going on to say,

03:10.400 --> 03:15.680
But some other people probably think Pratchett might have been a transphobe,

03:15.680 --> 03:19.360
so who knows? There's just no way to know.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.280
Now, my favorite part of this article is the following passage.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.320
Now, this is a particularly weird comparison, isn't it?

03:44.320 --> 03:50.240
Woodhouse died in 1975, and Jane Austen died in 1817,

03:50.240 --> 03:54.240
whereas Terry Pratchett died six years ago.

03:54.240 --> 04:00.080
Unless Dittom is claiming that trans people only became a thing within the last couple of years,

04:00.080 --> 04:05.360
this insisting that Pratchett couldn't have possibly had any opinions on trans issues

04:05.360 --> 04:07.360
is truly bizarre.

04:07.440 --> 04:12.240
Now, if the gender critical crowd had anything at all here,

04:12.240 --> 04:16.400
anything to go on that suggests that Pratchett would have been on their side,

04:16.400 --> 04:18.480
they would be on the attack right now.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.480
They're not usually known for their timidity in such matters.

04:22.480 --> 04:27.840
Sarah Dittom's both sides are wrong position is actually a hasty retreat.

04:27.840 --> 04:34.400
It's a signal to please stop pushing the Terry Pratchett thing because it's a losing battle for us.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.400
The transphobes accidentally opened up a losing front.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.280
Pratchett was an immensely popular author.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.080
Lots of famous people knew him personally.

04:44.080 --> 04:48.080
There's stories being posted about his support for trans people.

04:48.080 --> 04:52.000
His family and colleagues are stating he was not a transphobe,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.560
and there's been a surge of interest in the trans themes in his novels.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.280
So now Sarah Dittom is hastily like,

04:59.280 --> 05:01.120
Oh no, less of that, please.

05:01.120 --> 05:05.440
Terry Pratchett's been dead for like 200 years or something, right?

05:05.440 --> 05:08.640
Let's stop with all this wild speculation.

05:08.640 --> 05:12.160
Now, I confess I am not actually all that interested

05:12.160 --> 05:16.960
in the non-debate over what Terry Pratchett would think if he were alive.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.720
Firstly, because obviously people who knew him and worked with him

05:20.720 --> 05:23.760
are gonna have much more insight into what he would think

05:23.760 --> 05:26.400
than some random bigots on Twitter.

05:26.400 --> 05:31.440
But mainly, I'm not all that interested because Terry Pratchett was a prolific author

05:31.440 --> 05:35.920
who wrote thousands upon thousands of words in dozens of books.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.560
So if we want to know his opinions about something,

05:38.560 --> 05:42.160
we could just take his daughter's advice and read the books.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.480
Now, if someone were to ask me if I were a big fan of Discworld,

05:46.480 --> 05:51.360
I would answer that I'm six foot two and around 260 pounds.

05:51.360 --> 05:55.200
Because that's my joke I do when people ask me if I'm a big fan of something.

05:55.920 --> 06:00.240
But yes, I've read almost all the Discworld books, some multiple times.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.280
I liked them a lot.

06:01.280 --> 06:05.200
And if you've never read them, I would enthusiastically recommend you check them out.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.640
Anyway, as a self-professed Discworld expert here,

06:08.640 --> 06:11.440
please allow me to waffle about it for a bit.

06:11.440 --> 06:15.360
So, something you see come up again and again in the Discworld series

06:15.360 --> 06:18.480
are characters who are supposed to act one way,

06:18.480 --> 06:22.720
whether that's to conform with social, political, or religious norms,

06:22.720 --> 06:28.080
or even to conform to the sort of role someone like them is expected to play in a story,

06:28.640 --> 06:31.200
finding themselves wanting to act another way

06:31.200 --> 06:35.520
and being true to themselves despite the role they're expected to play.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.160
And this goes all the way to the series' roots.

06:38.160 --> 06:42.160
The third book in the series, Equal Rights Hardy Heart,

06:42.160 --> 06:45.120
is about the Discworld's first female wizard.

06:45.120 --> 06:48.080
You know, girls are supposed to be witches, of course,

06:48.080 --> 06:50.160
and boys are supposed to be wizards,

06:50.160 --> 06:53.760
but this girl is a wizard, and what does that mean?

06:54.320 --> 06:58.160
The witches' series of books is frequently concerned with the role

06:58.160 --> 07:01.280
that witches are supposed to play in stories,

07:01.280 --> 07:04.960
and how the characters conform to or defy those archetypes

07:04.960 --> 07:07.440
is often a large part of the narrative.

07:07.440 --> 07:12.400
And we see the same process on a larger scale for the Discworld's social groups.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.080
The principal setting of the books, the city of Ankh-Morpork,

07:16.080 --> 07:20.400
is a melting pot of the world's various races and cultures,

07:20.400 --> 07:25.280
all of which have stereotypes for and expectations of the other groups.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.800
Speciesism is the Disc's analogue for our racism

07:28.800 --> 07:31.760
and is most often explored in the City Watch books,

07:31.760 --> 07:36.640
where self-professed speciesist Sam Vimes has to oversee adding dwarves,

07:36.640 --> 07:41.360
werewolves, vampires, trolls, and so on to the ranks of the City Watch.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.840
And how all these different groups, with their histories of killing and oppressing

07:45.840 --> 07:51.680
and often eating each other, learn to live alongside one another is an ongoing theme.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.040
Also important is how these groups think of themselves,

07:55.040 --> 07:58.160
how they expect members of their own group to act,

07:58.160 --> 08:01.200
and how that interacts with their cultures and identities

08:01.200 --> 08:05.040
being absorbed into the dominant culture of the big city.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.040
So, with all that in mind, the Discworld's dwarves.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.400
Now, much of the discussion about Pratchett's opinion of trans people

08:12.400 --> 08:14.800
is focused on his dwarf characters,

08:14.800 --> 08:19.280
and specifically a dwarf from the Watch series, Corporal Littlebottom,

08:19.280 --> 08:20.640
which is a wonderful name.

08:20.640 --> 08:25.200
So Discworld's dwarves, poking a bit of fun at Tolkien's dwarves,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.440
typically all present as men,

08:27.440 --> 08:32.160
with what sex a dwarf actually is being considered a private affair,

08:32.160 --> 08:34.800
sort of a don't ask, don't tell system,

08:34.800 --> 08:38.320
except with regard to sex rather than sexuality.

08:38.320 --> 08:43.040
Anyway, Corporal Littlebottom decides to live openly as a woman,

08:43.040 --> 08:45.840
coming out as being a woman, basically,

08:45.840 --> 08:49.200
which obviously is not hard at all to read as an analogy

08:49.200 --> 08:52.720
for the experiences of trans people in our world.

08:52.720 --> 08:57.120
Now, as with many other of Pratchett's characters who break with traditions,

08:57.120 --> 09:00.160
it is to some degree played for laughs, right?

09:00.160 --> 09:02.800
Corporal Littlebottom retains her beard,

09:02.800 --> 09:06.320
and the heels on her boots are made of iron, for instance,

09:06.320 --> 09:10.800
but the humor is not presented in a way that is cruel or unaccommodating

09:10.800 --> 09:12.560
to the character herself.

09:12.560 --> 09:16.240
She is never presented as having done anything wrong,

09:16.240 --> 09:18.000
merely unexpected,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.320
and the humor comes from the subversion of that expectation, basically.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.920
It isn't malicious.

09:23.920 --> 09:28.720
Pratchett finds humor in all manner of topics considered sensitive.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.280
Race, sex, gender, and so on,

09:31.280 --> 09:34.720
the sorts of things that unfunny stand-up comedians bemoan

09:34.720 --> 09:36.800
you can't joke about anymore.

09:36.800 --> 09:40.640
And he's able to do so firstly because he doesn't punch down,

09:40.640 --> 09:44.240
but also because he doesn't just use issues like that for laughs.

09:44.240 --> 09:48.320
He treats them as seriously as their real-world counterparts.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.960
Dwarves who live openly as women in the Discworld are subject to discrimination.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.720
There are slurs for them.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.560
There are religious fundamentalist underground dwarven groups

09:58.560 --> 10:03.520
who think the surface-dwelling dwarves have been corrupted by modern society and so on.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.760
And the novel The Fifth Elephant features the possibility of a civil war

10:07.760 --> 10:11.120
between traditionalist and progressive dwarf groups.

10:11.120 --> 10:15.440
So we have a social expectation for certain people,

10:15.440 --> 10:17.280
or dwarves in this case,

10:17.280 --> 10:21.440
to act like their society's idea of a certain gender.

10:21.440 --> 10:27.200
And we have social repercussions for individuals who go against those expectations.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.440
And Pratchett's sympathies are pretty obviously with the progressives

10:31.440 --> 10:33.760
over the bigoted traditionalists.

10:33.760 --> 10:38.240
In response to one of Neil Gaiman's tweets supporting Rhianna Pratchett,

10:38.240 --> 10:40.800
someone responded with the following post.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.520
And Gaiman responded that in 2010 or so,

11:01.520 --> 11:07.280
Pratchett told him that he was proud that trans people saw themselves in his dwarves.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.320
Now, it just wasn't a thing on anyone's radar.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.720
It's reminiscent of Sarah Dittom's claim

11:12.720 --> 11:18.080
that the dead cannot be measured by the standards of a world in which they never lived.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.480
You know, they're trying to make it seem as if trans people

11:20.480 --> 11:23.920
just popped into existence in the last couple of years here.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.240
Now, I take issue with this, of course.

11:26.240 --> 11:31.840
Not just because to read Pratchett's dwarves as being in no way a commentary on trans issues

11:31.840 --> 11:34.880
requires a significant mental stretch,

11:34.880 --> 11:38.960
and not just because people insisting to Pratchett's daughter and co-author

11:38.960 --> 11:43.680
that they know more about what the man's opinions would be than they do is ridiculous,

11:43.680 --> 11:47.680
but because nobody's talking about Monstress Regiment.

11:47.680 --> 11:51.600
Now, Monstress Regiment is another Discworld novel by Pratchett

11:51.600 --> 11:54.720
that contains an even more obvious trans...

11:55.440 --> 12:01.600
Well, not analogy, really, just straight up what we would consider a trans character.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.040
So, spoilers for Monstress Regiment here, obviously.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.920
It's a good book, like most of the Discworld novels,

12:07.920 --> 12:09.360
and I'd recommend reading it.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.960
And if you want to read it unspoiled, goodbye, basically,

12:12.960 --> 12:16.160
because from here on out, I'll be talking about the whole plot.

12:16.160 --> 12:20.000
So, Monstress Regiment starts out as a Mulan-like story

12:20.000 --> 12:23.840
in which a young woman, Polly Perks, disguises herself as a man

12:23.840 --> 12:26.560
and enters military service during wartime

12:26.560 --> 12:30.080
in order to track down her brother, who's missing in action.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.760
Polly's country, Borogravia, is deeply conservative

12:33.760 --> 12:36.240
and considers things like women joining the army

12:36.240 --> 12:40.880
or dressing in men's clothes to be abominations unto their god.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.080
So, Polly blasphemously enlists in the military

12:44.080 --> 12:48.160
and is placed in a regiment of supposedly male soldiers who,

12:48.160 --> 12:51.040
over the course of the novel, are revealed one by one

12:51.040 --> 12:54.800
to also be women who join the military disguised as men,

12:54.800 --> 12:58.400
all of whom with their own individual reason for doing so.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.600
A whole regiment of Mulans, basically.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.240
One of them is pregnant and searching for the father.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.920
When one of a pair of particularly close recruits

13:07.920 --> 13:10.160
is discovered by Polly to be a woman,

13:10.160 --> 13:13.600
she assumes she joined the military to follow her man,

13:14.160 --> 13:18.560
except the man in question is also later revealed to be a woman.

13:18.560 --> 13:23.440
And this confuses Polly, who is chided for her sheltered lack of imagination

13:23.440 --> 13:26.560
by the regiment's vampire recruit, Maledict,

13:26.560 --> 13:29.760
who, of course, is later revealed to be Maledict-ah.

13:30.400 --> 13:35.040
They're all women, is the joke, and it's a good joke, it's funny.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.600
And, of course, they go on to have an adventure

13:37.600 --> 13:40.480
and bring an end to the war and all that.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.800
But that's not that important for us today.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.280
What I want to focus on is pronouns.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.960
Because how Pratchett uses pronouns here is important,

13:48.960 --> 13:51.440
obviously, given the nature of the story.

13:51.440 --> 13:56.400
And when gendering the characters, the narrative follows the perspective of Polly.

13:56.400 --> 14:01.200
So when Polly thinks a character is a man, the narration refers to them as he-him.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.760
But as Polly discovers they are in disguise,

14:03.760 --> 14:07.280
the narration changes to refer to them as she-her.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.600
So it's Polly's understanding that is guiding the narrator and the reader

14:11.600 --> 14:14.160
in how characters should be gendered.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.280
So with that in mind, the leader of the regiment

14:17.280 --> 14:21.280
is an old, experienced soldier named Sergeant Jackram.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.960
And at the conclusion of the story, Polly suspects that he, too,

14:24.960 --> 14:29.520
joined the military as a woman and has spent decades living as a man

14:29.520 --> 14:30.960
and asks him about it.

14:30.960 --> 14:35.680
Now, at the start of the conversation, Jackram is still referred to as he.

14:35.680 --> 14:40.080
He stirred into his beer, he unfastened the locket and so on.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.560
As he tells his story to Polly, however,

14:42.560 --> 14:45.680
a story of him following his lover to war,

14:45.680 --> 14:48.240
Jackram follows the pattern of the other characters

14:48.240 --> 14:50.720
and becomes a she in the narration.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.320
She began very carefully to transfer the chewing tobacco.

14:54.960 --> 15:00.960
This happens even though Jackram himself still refers to himself as a man in his speech.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.240
I'm my own man, always have been, he says.

15:04.240 --> 15:09.440
So Polly and Jackram discuss what Jackram is going to do now that the war is over.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.680
Jackram has a son he's never met,

15:11.680 --> 15:17.200
but expresses discomfort and embarrassment at the idea of turning up as his mother,

15:17.200 --> 15:18.720
to which Polly says,

15:18.720 --> 15:32.800
Now, with the end of the war and Jackram retiring from the army,

15:32.800 --> 15:37.920
there's no legal reason that he would need to pretend to be a man anymore.

15:37.920 --> 15:43.680
Continuing to live as a man would be for no other reason than because he wants to do it,

15:43.680 --> 15:48.160
because that's how he is more comfortable being perceived.

15:48.160 --> 15:52.880
And as Jackram is considering this idea, an interesting thing happens.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.880
Jackram's pronouns in the narration change back.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.040
Polly paused when she got to the door.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.120
Jackram had turned her chair to the fire and had settled back.

16:03.120 --> 16:06.000
Around him, the kitchen worked.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.200
Now, in pitching the idea to keep living as a man,

16:09.200 --> 16:13.040
Polly frames it for Jackram as a bit of cheeky deception.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.720
You know, the act of a trickster merely deciding to keep the act up.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.440
Now, whether she actually believes this,

16:19.440 --> 16:24.480
or whether she thinks it's just the best way to get Jackram to consider what she's saying,

16:24.480 --> 16:26.000
is up to the reader here.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
But the narration knows the truth.

16:28.640 --> 16:32.480
Jackram isn't a woman pretending to be a man at this point.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.920
He's just a man.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.520
In the epilogue of the story, Polly receives a message from Jackram

16:37.520 --> 16:41.680
with a photograph of him as a man united with his son's family,

16:41.680 --> 16:42.880
which is nice,

16:42.880 --> 16:48.080
and Polly becomes a sergeant in the reformed military that now admits women.

16:48.080 --> 16:52.080
And the novel ends with her meeting a pair of prospective army recruits,

16:52.080 --> 16:55.440
who are, of course, women disguised as men,

16:55.440 --> 17:00.240
and Polly tells the recruits that they're free to join as men if they like,

17:00.240 --> 17:02.160
saying it's up to them.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.720
And that's how Monstrous Regiment ends.

17:04.720 --> 17:10.160
The conclusion of the story is a positive affirmation of self-identification,

17:10.160 --> 17:13.760
and this novel was first published in 2003.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.240
The idea that Terry Pratchett lived in a world

17:16.240 --> 17:20.960
where trans issues were not a thing on anyone's radar is clearly not true.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.640
I mean, obviously, but, you know, there you go.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.320
I proved it, anyway.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.360
Thanks a lot for watching, folks.

17:31.360 --> 17:34.960
And thank you especially to my supporters over on Patreon,

17:34.960 --> 17:37.360
some of whom should be scrolling by right now.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.640
Patreon backers get early access to all my videos

17:41.280 --> 17:44.400
when they're worse and bits are missing

17:44.400 --> 17:46.080
and they've got mistakes in them.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.640
If you'd also like to ruin your viewing experience,

17:50.640 --> 17:52.960
I'll leave a link to my Patreon below.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.760
All right, that's it for me today, folks.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.360
I'll see you next time.
