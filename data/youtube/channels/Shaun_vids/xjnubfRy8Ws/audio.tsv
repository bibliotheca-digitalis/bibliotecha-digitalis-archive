0	1360	Hello, everyone.
1360	6160	On the 28th of July, journalist and author Laurie Penny shared a tweet thread
6160	13040	critical of transphobic hate group the LGB Alliance for sharing explicitly antisemitic material.
13040	19200	Laurie Penny refers to this as the intersection of antisemitism and transmisogyny.
19200	24560	Now, fantasy and sci-fi author Neil Gaiman responded to this tweet by saying,
25520	28320	And he's right, it isn't.
28320	34000	You know, if the sole reason an organization exists is to be bigoted towards one group,
34000	38240	it isn't very surprising that they'd also be bigoted towards another group.
38240	43360	Gaiman's comment, of course, saw dozens of angry, outraged replies from transphobes
43360	46480	accusing him of all sorts of silly things,
46480	51760	one of whom speculated that Gaiman's friend and co-author, the late Terry Pratchett,
51760	55280	must have been behind the good parts of Gaiman's writing.
55280	60160	And this set off some discussion about what Terry Pratchett would think about the trans
60160	64880	enormous air quotes debate if he were still alive today.
64880	70800	Now, I like the one user here who says Margaret Atwood's support for trans people was a shock,
70800	72640	which seems very bizarre.
72640	77600	Atwood's best-known work is set in a dystopia where womanhood is strictly tied
77600	80880	to the functioning of female reproductive systems,
80960	85120	handmaids who can't get pregnant are considered to be un-women.
85120	88160	You know, what were they expecting here after reading that?
88160	91520	Maybe they thought it was a utopian novel, who knows?
92080	94560	Anyway, on the 31st of July,
94560	100720	Rhianna Pratchett, daughter of Terry Pratchett, weighed in by responding to the following tweet.
100720	107840	I note that having not got over Atwood's betrayal, the GCs, GC standing for gender critical there,
107840	110880	are trying to recruit Terry Pratchett posthumously,
110880	114080	presumably because they know he can't contradict them.
114080	115760	And Rhianna Pratchett says,
122960	127200	And Neil Gaiman expressed support for this tweet in another of his own.
127760	132160	So the battle lines are drawn over what Terry Pratchett would think.
132160	135760	On the one hand, we have his close friends and family members,
135760	139600	and on the other we have some random transphobes on Twitter.
139600	143760	I wonder who's going to have the more accurate assessment of his character.
143760	145760	There's just no way to know.
146400	150240	And it sounds absurd, but journalist, I suppose,
150240	155280	Sarah Dittom took this exact line of argument in an article for the Times titled
155280	158640	You Can't Hijack the Dead for Today's Battles.
158640	163760	It's absurd for either trans activists or gender critical feminists to claim
163760	166160	that Terry Pratchett would have supported them.
181200	186480	So Dittom relays the argument, including Rhianna Pratchett's statement on the issue,
186480	190400	which should be the end of it, really, before going on to say,
190400	195680	But some other people probably think Pratchett might have been a transphobe,
195680	199360	so who knows? There's just no way to know.
199360	203280	Now, my favorite part of this article is the following passage.
220880	224320	Now, this is a particularly weird comparison, isn't it?
224320	230240	Woodhouse died in 1975, and Jane Austen died in 1817,
230240	234240	whereas Terry Pratchett died six years ago.
234240	240080	Unless Dittom is claiming that trans people only became a thing within the last couple of years,
240080	245360	this insisting that Pratchett couldn't have possibly had any opinions on trans issues
245360	247360	is truly bizarre.
247440	252240	Now, if the gender critical crowd had anything at all here,
252240	256400	anything to go on that suggests that Pratchett would have been on their side,
256400	258480	they would be on the attack right now.
258480	262480	They're not usually known for their timidity in such matters.
262480	267840	Sarah Dittom's both sides are wrong position is actually a hasty retreat.
267840	274400	It's a signal to please stop pushing the Terry Pratchett thing because it's a losing battle for us.
274400	278400	The transphobes accidentally opened up a losing front.
278400	281280	Pratchett was an immensely popular author.
281280	284080	Lots of famous people knew him personally.
284080	288080	There's stories being posted about his support for trans people.
288080	292000	His family and colleagues are stating he was not a transphobe,
292000	296560	and there's been a surge of interest in the trans themes in his novels.
296560	299280	So now Sarah Dittom is hastily like,
299280	301120	Oh no, less of that, please.
301120	305440	Terry Pratchett's been dead for like 200 years or something, right?
305440	308640	Let's stop with all this wild speculation.
308640	312160	Now, I confess I am not actually all that interested
312160	316960	in the non-debate over what Terry Pratchett would think if he were alive.
316960	320720	Firstly, because obviously people who knew him and worked with him
320720	323760	are gonna have much more insight into what he would think
323760	326400	than some random bigots on Twitter.
326400	331440	But mainly, I'm not all that interested because Terry Pratchett was a prolific author
331440	335920	who wrote thousands upon thousands of words in dozens of books.
335920	338560	So if we want to know his opinions about something,
338560	342160	we could just take his daughter's advice and read the books.
342880	346480	Now, if someone were to ask me if I were a big fan of Discworld,
346480	351360	I would answer that I'm six foot two and around 260 pounds.
351360	355200	Because that's my joke I do when people ask me if I'm a big fan of something.
355920	360240	But yes, I've read almost all the Discworld books, some multiple times.
360240	361280	I liked them a lot.
361280	365200	And if you've never read them, I would enthusiastically recommend you check them out.
365200	368640	Anyway, as a self-professed Discworld expert here,
368640	371440	please allow me to waffle about it for a bit.
371440	375360	So, something you see come up again and again in the Discworld series
375360	378480	are characters who are supposed to act one way,
378480	382720	whether that's to conform with social, political, or religious norms,
382720	388080	or even to conform to the sort of role someone like them is expected to play in a story,
388640	391200	finding themselves wanting to act another way
391200	395520	and being true to themselves despite the role they're expected to play.
395520	398160	And this goes all the way to the series' roots.
398160	402160	The third book in the series, Equal Rights Hardy Heart,
402160	405120	is about the Discworld's first female wizard.
405120	408080	You know, girls are supposed to be witches, of course,
408080	410160	and boys are supposed to be wizards,
410160	413760	but this girl is a wizard, and what does that mean?
414320	418160	The witches' series of books is frequently concerned with the role
418160	421280	that witches are supposed to play in stories,
421280	424960	and how the characters conform to or defy those archetypes
424960	427440	is often a large part of the narrative.
427440	432400	And we see the same process on a larger scale for the Discworld's social groups.
432400	436080	The principal setting of the books, the city of Ankh-Morpork,
436080	440400	is a melting pot of the world's various races and cultures,
440400	445280	all of which have stereotypes for and expectations of the other groups.
445280	448800	Speciesism is the Disc's analogue for our racism
448800	451760	and is most often explored in the City Watch books,
451760	456640	where self-professed speciesist Sam Vimes has to oversee adding dwarves,
456640	461360	werewolves, vampires, trolls, and so on to the ranks of the City Watch.
461360	465840	And how all these different groups, with their histories of killing and oppressing
465840	471680	and often eating each other, learn to live alongside one another is an ongoing theme.
471680	475040	Also important is how these groups think of themselves,
475040	478160	how they expect members of their own group to act,
478160	481200	and how that interacts with their cultures and identities
481200	485040	being absorbed into the dominant culture of the big city.
485040	489040	So, with all that in mind, the Discworld's dwarves.
489040	492400	Now, much of the discussion about Pratchett's opinion of trans people
492400	494800	is focused on his dwarf characters,
494800	499280	and specifically a dwarf from the Watch series, Corporal Littlebottom,
499280	500640	which is a wonderful name.
500640	505200	So Discworld's dwarves, poking a bit of fun at Tolkien's dwarves,
505200	507440	typically all present as men,
507440	512160	with what sex a dwarf actually is being considered a private affair,
512160	514800	sort of a don't ask, don't tell system,
514800	518320	except with regard to sex rather than sexuality.
518320	523040	Anyway, Corporal Littlebottom decides to live openly as a woman,
523040	525840	coming out as being a woman, basically,
525840	529200	which obviously is not hard at all to read as an analogy
529200	532720	for the experiences of trans people in our world.
532720	537120	Now, as with many other of Pratchett's characters who break with traditions,
537120	540160	it is to some degree played for laughs, right?
540160	542800	Corporal Littlebottom retains her beard,
542800	546320	and the heels on her boots are made of iron, for instance,
546320	550800	but the humor is not presented in a way that is cruel or unaccommodating
550800	552560	to the character herself.
552560	556240	She is never presented as having done anything wrong,
556240	558000	merely unexpected,
558000	562320	and the humor comes from the subversion of that expectation, basically.
562320	563920	It isn't malicious.
563920	568720	Pratchett finds humor in all manner of topics considered sensitive.
568720	571280	Race, sex, gender, and so on,
571280	574720	the sorts of things that unfunny stand-up comedians bemoan
574720	576800	you can't joke about anymore.
576800	580640	And he's able to do so firstly because he doesn't punch down,
580640	584240	but also because he doesn't just use issues like that for laughs.
584240	588320	He treats them as seriously as their real-world counterparts.
588320	592960	Dwarves who live openly as women in the Discworld are subject to discrimination.
592960	594720	There are slurs for them.
594720	598560	There are religious fundamentalist underground dwarven groups
598560	603520	who think the surface-dwelling dwarves have been corrupted by modern society and so on.
603520	607760	And the novel The Fifth Elephant features the possibility of a civil war
607760	611120	between traditionalist and progressive dwarf groups.
611120	615440	So we have a social expectation for certain people,
615440	617280	or dwarves in this case,
617280	621440	to act like their society's idea of a certain gender.
621440	627200	And we have social repercussions for individuals who go against those expectations.
627200	631440	And Pratchett's sympathies are pretty obviously with the progressives
631440	633760	over the bigoted traditionalists.
633760	638240	In response to one of Neil Gaiman's tweets supporting Rhianna Pratchett,
638240	640800	someone responded with the following post.
658720	661520	And Gaiman responded that in 2010 or so,
661520	667280	Pratchett told him that he was proud that trans people saw themselves in his dwarves.
667280	670320	Now, it just wasn't a thing on anyone's radar.
670320	672720	It's reminiscent of Sarah Dittom's claim
672720	678080	that the dead cannot be measured by the standards of a world in which they never lived.
678080	680480	You know, they're trying to make it seem as if trans people
680480	683920	just popped into existence in the last couple of years here.
683920	686240	Now, I take issue with this, of course.
686240	691840	Not just because to read Pratchett's dwarves as being in no way a commentary on trans issues
691840	694880	requires a significant mental stretch,
694880	698960	and not just because people insisting to Pratchett's daughter and co-author
698960	703680	that they know more about what the man's opinions would be than they do is ridiculous,
703680	707680	but because nobody's talking about Monstress Regiment.
707680	711600	Now, Monstress Regiment is another Discworld novel by Pratchett
711600	714720	that contains an even more obvious trans...
715440	721600	Well, not analogy, really, just straight up what we would consider a trans character.
721600	725040	So, spoilers for Monstress Regiment here, obviously.
725040	727920	It's a good book, like most of the Discworld novels,
727920	729360	and I'd recommend reading it.
729360	732960	And if you want to read it unspoiled, goodbye, basically,
732960	736160	because from here on out, I'll be talking about the whole plot.
736160	740000	So, Monstress Regiment starts out as a Mulan-like story
740000	743840	in which a young woman, Polly Perks, disguises herself as a man
743840	746560	and enters military service during wartime
746560	750080	in order to track down her brother, who's missing in action.
750080	753760	Polly's country, Borogravia, is deeply conservative
753760	756240	and considers things like women joining the army
756240	760880	or dressing in men's clothes to be abominations unto their god.
760880	764080	So, Polly blasphemously enlists in the military
764080	768160	and is placed in a regiment of supposedly male soldiers who,
768160	771040	over the course of the novel, are revealed one by one
771040	774800	to also be women who join the military disguised as men,
774800	778400	all of whom with their own individual reason for doing so.
778400	781600	A whole regiment of Mulans, basically.
781600	784240	One of them is pregnant and searching for the father.
784800	787920	When one of a pair of particularly close recruits
787920	790160	is discovered by Polly to be a woman,
790160	793600	she assumes she joined the military to follow her man,
794160	798560	except the man in question is also later revealed to be a woman.
798560	803440	And this confuses Polly, who is chided for her sheltered lack of imagination
803440	806560	by the regiment's vampire recruit, Maledict,
806560	809760	who, of course, is later revealed to be Maledict-ah.
810400	815040	They're all women, is the joke, and it's a good joke, it's funny.
815040	817600	And, of course, they go on to have an adventure
817600	820480	and bring an end to the war and all that.
820480	822800	But that's not that important for us today.
822800	825280	What I want to focus on is pronouns.
825840	828960	Because how Pratchett uses pronouns here is important,
828960	831440	obviously, given the nature of the story.
831440	836400	And when gendering the characters, the narrative follows the perspective of Polly.
836400	841200	So when Polly thinks a character is a man, the narration refers to them as he-him.
841200	843760	But as Polly discovers they are in disguise,
843760	847280	the narration changes to refer to them as she-her.
847280	851600	So it's Polly's understanding that is guiding the narrator and the reader
851600	854160	in how characters should be gendered.
854240	857280	So with that in mind, the leader of the regiment
857280	861280	is an old, experienced soldier named Sergeant Jackram.
861280	864960	And at the conclusion of the story, Polly suspects that he, too,
864960	869520	joined the military as a woman and has spent decades living as a man
869520	870960	and asks him about it.
870960	875680	Now, at the start of the conversation, Jackram is still referred to as he.
875680	880080	He stirred into his beer, he unfastened the locket and so on.
880080	882560	As he tells his story to Polly, however,
882560	885680	a story of him following his lover to war,
885680	888240	Jackram follows the pattern of the other characters
888240	890720	and becomes a she in the narration.
890720	894320	She began very carefully to transfer the chewing tobacco.
894960	900960	This happens even though Jackram himself still refers to himself as a man in his speech.
900960	904240	I'm my own man, always have been, he says.
904240	909440	So Polly and Jackram discuss what Jackram is going to do now that the war is over.
909520	911680	Jackram has a son he's never met,
911680	917200	but expresses discomfort and embarrassment at the idea of turning up as his mother,
917200	918720	to which Polly says,
918720	932800	Now, with the end of the war and Jackram retiring from the army,
932800	937920	there's no legal reason that he would need to pretend to be a man anymore.
937920	943680	Continuing to live as a man would be for no other reason than because he wants to do it,
943680	948160	because that's how he is more comfortable being perceived.
948160	952880	And as Jackram is considering this idea, an interesting thing happens.
952880	956880	Jackram's pronouns in the narration change back.
956880	959040	Polly paused when she got to the door.
959040	963120	Jackram had turned her chair to the fire and had settled back.
963120	966000	Around him, the kitchen worked.
966000	969200	Now, in pitching the idea to keep living as a man,
969200	973040	Polly frames it for Jackram as a bit of cheeky deception.
973040	976720	You know, the act of a trickster merely deciding to keep the act up.
977280	979440	Now, whether she actually believes this,
979440	984480	or whether she thinks it's just the best way to get Jackram to consider what she's saying,
984480	986000	is up to the reader here.
986000	988000	But the narration knows the truth.
988640	992480	Jackram isn't a woman pretending to be a man at this point.
992480	993920	He's just a man.
993920	997520	In the epilogue of the story, Polly receives a message from Jackram
997520	1001680	with a photograph of him as a man united with his son's family,
1001680	1002880	which is nice,
1002880	1008080	and Polly becomes a sergeant in the reformed military that now admits women.
1008080	1012080	And the novel ends with her meeting a pair of prospective army recruits,
1012080	1015440	who are, of course, women disguised as men,
1015440	1020240	and Polly tells the recruits that they're free to join as men if they like,
1020240	1022160	saying it's up to them.
1022160	1024720	And that's how Monstrous Regiment ends.
1024720	1030160	The conclusion of the story is a positive affirmation of self-identification,
1030160	1033760	and this novel was first published in 2003.
1033760	1036240	The idea that Terry Pratchett lived in a world
1036240	1040960	where trans issues were not a thing on anyone's radar is clearly not true.
1043200	1046640	I mean, obviously, but, you know, there you go.
1046640	1048320	I proved it, anyway.
1049360	1051360	Thanks a lot for watching, folks.
