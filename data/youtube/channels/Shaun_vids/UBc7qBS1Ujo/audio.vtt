00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about The Bell Curve.

00:03.840 --> 00:10.520
The Bell Curve is a 1994 book by psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Murray,

00:10.520 --> 00:15.960
and by way of an introduction here, I'll read the description of the book that's on the back of my copy.

00:16.360 --> 00:23.840
Breaking new ground and old taboos, Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray tell the story of a society in transformation.

00:23.840 --> 00:31.080
At the top, a cognitive elite is forming in which the past key to the best schools and the best jobs is no longer social background,

00:31.080 --> 00:33.080
but high intelligence.

00:33.080 --> 00:40.520
At the bottom, the common denominator of the underclass is increasingly low intelligence rather than racial or social disadvantage.

00:40.520 --> 00:45.720
The Bell Curve describes the state of scientific knowledge about questions that have been on people's minds for years,

00:45.720 --> 00:49.160
but have been considered too sensitive to talk about openly.

00:49.320 --> 00:56.160
Among them, IQ's relationship to crime, unemployment, welfare, child neglect, poverty, and illegitimacy,

00:56.160 --> 01:01.960
ethnic differences in intelligence, trends in fertility among women with different levels of intelligence,

01:01.960 --> 01:07.160
and what policy can do and cannot do to compensate for differences in intelligence.

01:07.160 --> 01:15.280
Brilliantly argued and meticulously documented, The Bell Curve is the essential first step in coming to grips with the nation's social problems.

01:15.320 --> 01:20.920
Even though it is now 25 years old, The Bell Curve's ideas have had quite the lasting impact.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.440
Richard Herrnstein passed away shortly before The Bell Curve was released,

01:24.440 --> 01:31.040
but the other author, Charles Murray, has in recent years, among other things, been on an episode of Making Sense with Sam Harris.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.080
He's been interviewed on Stefan Molyneux's YouTube channel,

01:34.080 --> 01:37.160
had his ideas discussed on the Joe Rogan podcast,

01:37.160 --> 01:43.040
and regular viewers of my channel will remember The Bell Curve being cited in a recent Steven Crowder video.

01:43.120 --> 01:50.280
At the time of the book's release, the backlash against it in certain sections of the media and scientific community was furious.

01:50.280 --> 01:54.480
Dozens of articles were written by scientists and journalists attacking the book,

01:54.480 --> 02:00.080
studies were conducted to debunk its claims, whole books were written to debunk its claims, actually,

02:00.080 --> 02:03.840
and these criticisms were often phrased very harshly.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.680
Columnist Bob Herbert, writing for the New York Times, described the book as

02:07.680 --> 02:12.880
as a scabrous piece of racial pornography masquerading as serious scholarship.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.920
Mr. Murray can protest all he wants, wrote Herbert.

02:15.920 --> 02:21.200
His book is just a genteel way of calling someone the N-word.

02:21.200 --> 02:26.240
This controversy ignited by The Bell Curve has also had quite the lasting impact.

02:26.240 --> 02:29.840
When Charles Murray is invited to speak at college campuses, for instance,

02:29.840 --> 02:36.000
people turn out in protest, often with angry cries of racist, eugenicist, and so on.

02:36.000 --> 02:44.080
And from the enraged reaction to The Bell Curve, a new reader might expect the book to be blatant and unapologetic racist propaganda.

02:44.080 --> 02:50.800
A neo-Nazi screed arguing for the supremacy of the high IQ white race and such things as that.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.600
However, when we actually sit down and read the book, things aren't quite that simple.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.440
Consider the following quotes.

02:57.440 --> 03:04.880
If tomorrow you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that all the cognitive differences between races were 100% genetic in origin,

03:04.880 --> 03:07.360
nothing of any significance should change.

03:07.360 --> 03:14.720
The knowledge would give you no reason to treat individuals differently than if ethnic differences were 100% environmental.

03:14.720 --> 03:21.040
In any case, you are not going to learn tomorrow that all cognitive differences between races are 100% genetic in origin

03:21.040 --> 03:27.760
because the scientific state of knowledge, unfinished as it is, already gives sample evidence that environment is part of the story.

03:27.760 --> 03:34.480
If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other,

03:34.480 --> 03:39.040
we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other.

03:39.040 --> 03:44.960
It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.640
What might the mix be?

03:46.640 --> 03:49.200
We are resolutely agnostic on that issue.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.600
As far as we can determine, the evidence does not justify an estimate.

03:53.600 --> 04:02.080
For virtually all the topics we will be discussing, cognitive ability accounts for only small to middling proportions of the variation among people.

04:02.080 --> 04:11.520
It almost always explains less than 20% of the variance, to use the statistician's term, usually less than 10% and often less than 5%.

04:11.520 --> 04:17.280
What this means in English is that you cannot predict what a given person will do from his IQ score.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.960
So what's going on here?

04:18.960 --> 04:24.240
It seems, from these quotes anyway, that the bell curve is actually a fairly reasonable piece of work.

04:24.240 --> 04:33.120
These are all relatively mild, middle-of-the-road statements here, so this hardly seems like a scabrous piece of racial pornography so far.

04:33.120 --> 04:40.960
Charles Murray has used quotes from the bell curve, such as we have just read, to defend himself and his work against accusations of racism.

04:40.960 --> 04:50.720
Murray and other defenders of the bell curve cast the attacks on the book as resulting from a cowardly reluctance to discuss what they see as difficult scientific truths.

04:50.720 --> 04:56.880
In particular, a reluctance to discuss possible differences in intelligence across designated racial groups.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.040
So this is what we're gonna talk about today.

04:59.040 --> 05:07.120
We're gonna take a look at some of the arguments in the bell curve, discuss some of the most common counterarguments, and see if we can figure out what all the fuss is about.

05:07.120 --> 05:13.680
Did the bell curve deserve its harsh criticism, or is it the case that its critics simply cannot handle the truth?

05:13.680 --> 05:17.920
Before we get to all that, though, as you can see, this video is rather long.

05:17.920 --> 05:25.840
I expect people may have to watch this one in multiple parts, so firstly here, let's just take a second to lay out the format of the video today.

05:25.840 --> 05:30.080
First off, we're gonna briefly talk about intelligence and intelligence testing,

05:30.080 --> 05:36.880
and quickly mention a few concepts that are gonna be important going forward, such as Spearman's G and Factor Analysis.

05:36.880 --> 05:43.600
Then we're gonna introduce the bell curve and summarize the arguments of each of its four main sections as fairly as we can.

05:43.600 --> 05:50.480
After that, we'll move on to counterarguments in sections primarily concerned with the concept of a general intelligence,

05:50.480 --> 05:56.960
the possible problems with IQ testing, the bell curve's calculation of IQ versus environmental factors,

05:56.960 --> 06:01.920
and finally, the political arguments and policy proposals found within the book.

06:01.920 --> 06:07.200
I will include time codes to all of these sections below so you can drop out and come back as needed.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.960
Right then, let's get started.

06:08.960 --> 06:16.080
And if we're going to be reading a book that is about intelligence, we should start off by briefly talking about exactly what that is.

06:16.080 --> 06:20.320
Let's imagine that we want to design an intelligence test from scratch.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.920
And to do this, we first have to answer two difficult questions.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.920
The first is, how exactly do we define intelligence?

06:27.920 --> 06:31.360
And this is a particularly tricky thing to do, as we'll see.

06:31.360 --> 06:37.520
Let's start with the dictionary definition of intelligence, which is as good a place to start as any, I suppose.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.080
And this is from the Oxford English Dictionary.

06:40.080 --> 06:45.120
Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.

06:45.120 --> 06:49.040
Now, our first problem here is that this definition is rather broad.

06:49.040 --> 06:55.440
Think about all the activities and groups of activities that could fall under this definition of intelligence.

06:55.440 --> 07:00.400
Is one's ability to solve complicated mathematical sums governed by intelligence?

07:00.400 --> 07:03.920
How about the ability to solve a difficult chess puzzle?

07:03.920 --> 07:08.000
I'd imagine we'd say those things are associated with intelligence, right?

07:08.000 --> 07:12.960
Well, how about the ability to write a great novel or compose a great piece of music?

07:12.960 --> 07:17.360
Are those things influenced by intelligence, or would we merely call that creativity?

07:18.000 --> 07:25.360
Is knowing whether to pass or shoot in a game of basketball or football influenced by intelligence, or would we merely call that talent?

07:25.360 --> 07:30.000
Or are all of these things some mix of intelligence, talent, and creativity?

07:30.000 --> 07:34.240
We can certainly imagine a novel that is written intelligently, for instance.

07:34.240 --> 07:42.160
Could we say this is some sort of creative intelligence, or are intelligence and creativity strictly two entirely different concepts?

07:42.160 --> 07:46.480
Is there a difference between memorizing and applying a mathematical function, say,

07:46.480 --> 07:52.640
and memorizing and carrying out a piano piece or a dance routine or a set of football plays?

07:53.360 --> 07:56.080
If there is a difference, what is it?

07:56.080 --> 08:02.000
By what metric are we declaring some of those things to be governed by intelligence and others not?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.760
Are there such things as social and emotional intelligence?

08:05.760 --> 08:10.480
What we might call the ability to read a room, to be aware of the emotions of others,

08:10.480 --> 08:13.600
and to react appropriately in interactions with them.

08:13.600 --> 08:18.560
Is intelligence involved there, or should we just call that something like being sociable?

08:18.560 --> 08:25.920
All the various things I just mentioned can be argued to fall under the umbrella of acquiring and applying knowledge and skills, right?

08:25.920 --> 08:30.160
Defining exactly what intelligence is is a very difficult thing to do,

08:30.160 --> 08:35.920
and there is a wide range of opinions among scientists and academics about the best way to go about it.

08:35.920 --> 08:40.480
Following the publication of The Bell Curve and inspired by the harsh criticism it received,

08:40.480 --> 08:42.240
a public statement entitled,

08:42.240 --> 08:49.200
Mainstream Science on Intelligence, was written by Professor Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.200
The statement sets out to outline,

08:51.200 --> 08:55.440
conclusions regarded as mainstream among researchers on intelligence,

08:55.440 --> 09:02.240
in particular on the nature, origins, and practical consequences of individual and group differences in intelligence.

09:02.240 --> 09:07.440
The statement was sent to 131 researchers of whom 52 signed it,

09:07.440 --> 09:10.240
many of whom are themselves cited in The Bell Curve.

09:10.240 --> 09:16.560
Important for us here is that mainstream science on intelligence gives the following definition of intelligence.

09:16.560 --> 09:24.400
Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems,

09:24.400 --> 09:30.720
think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.

09:30.720 --> 09:35.440
It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test taking smarts.

09:35.440 --> 09:40.640
Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings,

09:40.640 --> 09:45.360
catching on, making sense of things, or figuring out what to do.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.720
My favorite part of this definition is, among other things,

09:48.720 --> 09:52.960
because intelligence is apparently all of this and some other stuff too.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.800
My point here is that even among researchers who are cited in The Bell Curve

09:56.800 --> 10:03.360
and would put their name to a defense of its ideas, intelligence is a very broadly defined concept.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.800
And even if we can agree on a definition of intelligence,

10:06.800 --> 10:09.440
the second difficult question we have to answer is this.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.400
How exactly do we measure it?

10:12.400 --> 10:15.920
It's not as simple as testing for some other human abilities.

10:15.920 --> 10:20.240
We can measure how fast someone is by using units of time and distance,

10:20.240 --> 10:24.000
and we can measure how strong someone is by using units of weight.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.840
But what do you use to quantify how smart someone is?

10:27.840 --> 10:30.480
What we need here is an intelligence unit.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.320
We need a way to express someone's intelligence as a number.

10:34.320 --> 10:39.120
Now, most people today will recognize IQ as the most common intelligence unit,

10:39.120 --> 10:42.320
and let's briefly talk a little about how that came to be.

10:42.480 --> 10:48.160
So way back in the old days, if we wanted to determine someone's personality traits and abilities,

10:48.160 --> 10:52.640
we could measure their skull, calculate the volume of their brain,

10:52.640 --> 10:55.120
or simply look at their facial features.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.120
Phrenology, however, has fallen out of favor with scientists of late,

10:59.120 --> 11:03.920
although it should be noted the technology sector is currently in the process of reinventing it.

11:03.920 --> 11:07.840
Now, I won't be going all that deeply into the history of intelligence testing today,

11:07.840 --> 11:11.200
so I'll just start off here by saying that researchers eventually,

11:11.200 --> 11:14.880
for the most part anyway, stopped measuring people's skulls

11:14.880 --> 11:18.400
and started trying to measure what was going on inside them.

11:18.400 --> 11:25.200
The first practical IQ test was invented by French psychologist Alfred Binet in 1905.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.880
This test set out to determine the mental age of school children

11:28.880 --> 11:31.840
and was designed with the purpose of identifying those children

11:31.840 --> 11:36.160
who were underperforming compared to their peers so they could be given extra help.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.040
Such noble beginnings here.

11:39.040 --> 11:43.600
Now, Binet, for his part, stressed that intelligence was affected by environmental factors,

11:43.600 --> 11:47.600
was not expressible as a singular fixed numerical value,

11:47.600 --> 11:50.480
and was not exclusively genetic in origin.

11:50.480 --> 11:54.480
His test was designed to identify those who were struggling in school

11:54.480 --> 11:58.480
and not to rank people into some sort of eugenic hierarchy.

11:58.480 --> 12:03.520
Binet died in 1911 and has since spent the majority of his time spinning in his grave

12:03.520 --> 12:06.160
due to everything else we're going to talk about today.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.280
An American psychologist called Henry H. Goddard

12:09.280 --> 12:13.040
translated Binet's intelligence test into English in 1908

12:13.040 --> 12:17.280
and distributed thousands of copies of the test across the United States.

12:17.280 --> 12:21.680
And in 1916, another American psychologist named Louis Terman,

12:21.680 --> 12:24.800
working for the Stanford Graduate School of Education,

12:24.800 --> 12:29.760
revised the test into what we know today as the Stanford-Binet IQ test.

12:29.760 --> 12:33.440
Both Goddard and Terman also worked together with other psychologists

12:33.440 --> 12:36.880
to create the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests,

12:36.880 --> 12:42.400
which were intelligence tests administered to US military recruits during World War I.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.040
Before we go any further, I'd like to pause for a second

12:45.040 --> 12:48.560
and propose a question about our intelligence tests here.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.480
How do we know that they are actually measuring intelligence?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.800
They're called intelligence tests, sure,

12:54.800 --> 12:59.200
but that doesn't necessarily mean they are actually measuring intelligence, does it?

12:59.200 --> 13:02.800
As we discussed earlier, intelligence is a very broad concept.

13:02.800 --> 13:06.320
How do we know we're not merely measuring a tiny segment of it?

13:06.320 --> 13:10.400
Well, in the early 20th century, English psychologist Charles Spearman

13:10.400 --> 13:13.440
used a statistical technique called factor analysis

13:13.440 --> 13:16.640
to identify what he called the G factor.

13:16.640 --> 13:20.320
Spearman noticed that people's test results across a range of subjects

13:20.320 --> 13:23.680
were positively correlated, and reasoned that this was because

13:23.680 --> 13:28.480
of an underlying general intelligence factor, which he dubbed G.

13:28.480 --> 13:33.120
And this G factor supposedly underlies all mental performance,

13:33.120 --> 13:35.360
so no matter the subject being tested,

13:35.360 --> 13:39.360
they are all influenced by this one general intelligence factor.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.920
And psychometricians claim that IQ tests measure this G factor,

13:43.920 --> 13:48.240
psychometricians being people concerned with psychological measurement there.

13:48.240 --> 13:52.080
Now, G answers both of our difficult questions, if you'd noticed.

13:52.080 --> 13:56.160
Thanks to the G factor, the vast range of potential human intelligence

13:56.160 --> 13:59.040
is no longer a barrier to us testing for it,

13:59.040 --> 14:02.960
because it's supposedly all linked to a single underlying factor

14:02.960 --> 14:07.440
that is able to be measured and expressed as a single numerical value.

14:07.440 --> 14:11.280
It's very handy, isn't it, this general intelligence factor?

14:11.280 --> 14:13.440
Suspiciously handy, one might say,

14:13.440 --> 14:17.760
but we'll talk more about G and Spearman's factor analysis later on.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.400
Now, before we conclude our little history lesson here,

14:20.400 --> 14:22.640
there is something else that must be noted,

14:22.640 --> 14:26.560
and it's that early proponents of IQ testing in America and elsewhere

14:26.560 --> 14:31.360
were not motivated solely by some neutral scientific curiosity.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.040
They were eugenicists.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.000
They wanted to use what they could learn from intelligence testing

14:36.000 --> 14:39.840
as a way to improve the genetic quality of the human population

14:39.840 --> 14:42.480
through what amounts to selective breeding.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.760
Henry Goddard, who translated Binet's intelligence test,

14:45.760 --> 14:50.400
proposed segregating the so-called feeble-minded into colonies

14:50.400 --> 14:52.560
separate from the rest of society.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.520
And Lewis Turman, author of the Stanford-Binet test,

14:55.520 --> 15:00.720
wrote the following in a 1916 work called The Uses of Intelligence Tests.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.840
Thus far, intelligence tests have found their chief application

15:03.840 --> 15:07.600
in the identification and grading of the feeble-minded.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.920
It is safe to predict that in the near future,

15:09.920 --> 15:14.000
intelligence tests will bring tens of thousands of these high-grade defectives

15:14.000 --> 15:16.080
under the surveillance of society.

15:16.080 --> 15:20.560
This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness

15:20.560 --> 15:23.840
and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime,

15:23.840 --> 15:28.160
pauperism, and industrial inefficiency, end quote.

15:28.160 --> 15:33.200
And tens of thousands of Americans were forcibly sterilized during the last century,

15:33.200 --> 15:38.240
and low IQ test results were used to justify many of those sterilizations.

15:38.240 --> 15:42.720
The eugenics movement lost a lot of momentum as a result of the Second World War,

15:42.720 --> 15:45.680
during which eugenics became irrevocably associated

15:45.680 --> 15:48.560
with many of the worst crimes of Nazi Germany.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.840
And in the following decades,

15:49.840 --> 15:52.800
many countries distanced themselves from eugenics policies,

15:52.800 --> 15:57.280
and many scientists became more suspicious of not just eugenics itself,

15:57.280 --> 16:01.760
but also the extent of the worth of intelligence testing as a concept.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.920
Now, not to spoil the end of my video here,

16:03.920 --> 16:08.400
but this is a good chunk of the reason that the reaction to the bell curve was so harsh.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.040
The idea that we can use intelligence test results

16:11.040 --> 16:15.920
in order to inform political policy was only half a lifetime before the book was written,

16:15.920 --> 16:18.160
getting people sent to gas chambers.

16:18.160 --> 16:22.000
So it's not surprising that people would be rather suspicious about it.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.040
Let's just say that anyone attempting to resurrect this idea

16:25.040 --> 16:28.000
needs to be incredibly aware of and respectful of

16:28.000 --> 16:30.720
exactly where what they're proposing can lead.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.840
So people are fleeing eugenics in droves

16:33.840 --> 16:38.640
simply because it was used to justify an indefensible crime against humanity,

16:38.640 --> 16:44.160
and scientists are increasingly skeptical of the extent of the usefulness of intelligence testing

16:44.160 --> 16:49.200
and IQ and efforts to rank people according to biology in general.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.080
And all this brings us to the bell curve.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.240
The empire strikes back.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.120
And in this book,

16:55.120 --> 16:58.800
Herrnstein and Murray come to the defense of IQ and say now,

16:58.800 --> 17:00.800
everyone calm down.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.920
Don't throw the baby out with the bath water here.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.920
Intelligence testing and IQ are important and useful concepts,

17:07.920 --> 17:12.320
and crucially, what we can learn from IQ testing should inform our politics

17:12.320 --> 17:14.880
and be used to change our society.

17:15.440 --> 17:19.440
So, you know, eugenics, but nice this time.

17:19.440 --> 17:24.240
And since we've now arrived at the bell curve, I think it's time for us to read it.

17:24.240 --> 17:27.200
Not all of it, right now, we'd be here all day,

17:27.200 --> 17:29.360
but I will briefly summarize it here,

17:29.360 --> 17:32.960
for the most part using the introductions that precede each chapter.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.320
In the introduction to the book,

17:34.320 --> 17:37.600
Herrnstein and Murray begin by talking about intelligence.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.240
They offer Spearman's definition of intelligence as

17:40.240 --> 17:43.520
a person's capacity for complex mental work,

17:43.520 --> 17:47.680
and argue that general intelligence can be measured by IQ tests,

17:47.680 --> 17:48.400
saying,

17:48.400 --> 17:50.720
Furthermore, the classicists point out,

17:50.720 --> 17:54.160
the best standardized tests, such as a modern IQ test,

17:54.160 --> 17:57.200
do a reasonably good job of measuring IQ.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.320
When properly administered, the tests are not measurably biased

18:00.320 --> 18:03.520
against socioeconomic, ethnic, or racial subgroups.

18:03.520 --> 18:07.520
They predict a wide variety of socially important outcomes.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.000
They also defend the practice of IQ testing

18:10.000 --> 18:12.640
from critics within the scientific community,

18:12.640 --> 18:16.160
notably evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould,

18:16.160 --> 18:19.600
whose 1981 book, The Mismeasure of Man, was,

18:19.600 --> 18:21.520
quoting the back of my copy here,

18:21.520 --> 18:23.760
immediately hailed as a masterwork,

18:23.760 --> 18:26.800
the ringing answer to those who would classify people,

18:26.800 --> 18:30.720
rank them according to their supposed genetic gifts and limits.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.680
In this book, Gould is highly critical of everything from

18:33.680 --> 18:37.200
phrenology and craniometry to modern IQ testing.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.880
He argues against the concept of a single general intelligence,

18:40.880 --> 18:44.400
and he highlights cases where eugenicists and psychometricians

18:44.400 --> 18:48.560
had relied upon bad data and flawed statistical techniques,

18:48.560 --> 18:50.800
including the case of Cyril Berth,

18:50.800 --> 18:53.200
an early proponent of the use of twin studies

18:53.200 --> 18:55.520
for examining the heritability of intelligence,

18:55.520 --> 19:00.080
who, after he died, was revealed to have just been making up his research data.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.640
That's one way to do it, I suppose.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.680
The bell curve was written with the Mismeasure of Man in mind,

19:05.680 --> 19:08.720
and is in some ways a response to its claims.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.360
A newer edition of the Mismeasure of Man was printed

19:11.360 --> 19:14.880
with an extra chapter responding to the claims of the bell curve,

19:14.880 --> 19:17.200
and a newer edition of the bell curve was printed

19:17.200 --> 19:21.120
with an extra chapter responding in part to Stephen Jay Gould.

19:21.120 --> 19:25.040
Gould and Murray probably should have just met up and had a fight at this point.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.040
On pages 22 and 23,

19:27.040 --> 19:30.800
Hans-Nina Murray summarized their main claims about intelligence,

19:30.800 --> 19:32.400
which are the following.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.840
One, there is such a thing as a general factor of cognitive ability

19:35.840 --> 19:37.760
on which human beings differ.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.280
Two, all standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement

19:41.280 --> 19:43.680
measure this general factor to some degree,

19:43.680 --> 19:48.240
but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.280
Three, IQ scores match, to a first degree,

19:51.280 --> 19:53.680
whatever it is that people mean when they use the word

19:53.680 --> 19:56.400
intelligent or smart in ordinary language.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.960
Four, IQ scores are stable,

19:58.960 --> 20:02.160
although not perfectly so over much of a person's life.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.680
Five, properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased

20:05.680 --> 20:08.400
against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.760
And six, cognitive ability is substantially heritable,

20:11.760 --> 20:14.800
apparently no less than 40% and no more than 80%.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.400
And on that last point,

20:16.400 --> 20:18.880
Hans-Nina Murray later writes in a section titled

20:18.880 --> 20:21.120
How Much Is IQ a Matter of Genes?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.120
For purposes of this discussion,

20:23.120 --> 20:27.120
we will adopt a middling estimate of 60% heritability,

20:27.120 --> 20:32.960
which by extension means that IQ is about 40% a matter of environment.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.680
So, on to part one of the bell curve,

20:35.680 --> 20:38.720
which is titled The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite,

20:38.720 --> 20:40.880
and introduces Hans-Nina Murray's theory

20:40.880 --> 20:43.680
of the cognitive partitioning of society.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.240
Since World War II, they argue,

20:46.240 --> 20:50.560
colleges in the United States have increasingly admitted people by test score

20:50.560 --> 20:54.400
rather than things like social standing or familial connections.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.120
Where you could once expect to attend a prestigious college

20:57.120 --> 20:58.960
if your father had gone there, for instance,

20:58.960 --> 21:02.880
increasingly you now need to have competitive test scores.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.480
This has led to high IQ people being found disproportionately

21:06.480 --> 21:10.000
in the top institutions and geographically close together.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.440
The job market is also increasingly IQ focused,

21:13.440 --> 21:16.240
as low IQ jobs are replaced by automation,

21:16.240 --> 21:21.360
and the best jobs have apparently become more selective of high IQ candidates.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.680
IQ is also apparently a very good predictor of job performance.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.120
These high IQ people,

21:27.120 --> 21:31.280
economically and geographically segregated from the rest of society,

21:31.280 --> 21:33.600
are increasingly partnering with each other,

21:33.600 --> 21:36.640
and since we're assuming IQ is largely genetic,

21:36.640 --> 21:39.360
are producing high IQ offspring.

21:39.360 --> 21:45.120
Society is thus stratifying itself into some sort of intelligence-based caste system.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.080
At the end of part one,

21:46.080 --> 21:49.040
Hans-Nina Murray summarized their claims by saying,

21:49.040 --> 21:51.840
One, the cognitive elite is getting richer in an era

21:51.840 --> 21:54.640
when everyone else is having to struggle to stay even.

21:54.640 --> 21:58.640
Two, the cognitive elite is increasingly segregated physically from everyone else

21:58.640 --> 22:00.720
in both the workplace and the neighborhood.

22:00.720 --> 22:05.120
And three, the cognitive elite is increasingly likely to intermarry.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.880
Part two of the bell curve is titled

22:06.880 --> 22:09.280
Cognitive Classes and Social Behavior,

22:09.280 --> 22:11.520
and here, Hans-Nina Murray make the case that

22:11.520 --> 22:16.320
intelligence is tied to behavior and predictably determines various things,

22:16.320 --> 22:20.160
such as the likelihood of being poor, a criminal, a high school dropout,

22:20.160 --> 22:23.360
unemployed, an unwed mother, on welfare, and so on.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.200
In order to argue this,

22:25.200 --> 22:28.400
Hans-Nina Murray first introduced the source of their data,

22:28.400 --> 22:32.400
which is the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, or AFQT.

22:33.120 --> 22:39.120
This test was taken as part of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.

22:39.120 --> 22:42.320
The subjects of this survey were aged 14 to 22,

22:42.320 --> 22:46.080
and were administered the Armed Forces Qualifying Test in 1980.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.600
Researchers then interviewed the group over the following decade,

22:49.600 --> 22:52.320
asking them various questions about themselves.

22:52.320 --> 22:56.080
Hans-Nina Murray used the respondents' scores on the AFQT

22:56.080 --> 22:58.400
to determine the IQ of each person,

22:58.400 --> 23:01.920
and then used their later interview answers to calculate to what degree

23:01.920 --> 23:05.600
a high IQ is correlated with positive life outcomes,

23:05.600 --> 23:09.680
and to what degree a low IQ is correlated with negative outcomes.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.000
Throughout the rest of this section of the bell curve,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.640
Hans-Nina Murray go further than simply arguing

23:14.640 --> 23:18.640
for the correlation between low IQ and those negative life outcomes.

23:18.640 --> 23:22.960
They make the case that one's AFQT score correlates with them more strongly

23:22.960 --> 23:25.520
than socioeconomic status does.

23:25.520 --> 23:29.120
Hans-Nina Murray compare the AFQT scores of each respondent

23:29.120 --> 23:34.240
against their calculation of the socioeconomic status of the respondent's parents.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.600
So, as the book Inequality by Design puts it,

23:37.600 --> 23:40.480
roughly in the bell curve statistical comparisons,

23:40.480 --> 23:46.320
the parent's class represents nurture, and the AFQT score represents nature.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.480
Looking at various negative life outcomes,

23:48.480 --> 23:52.160
like being in poverty, being in jail, being unemployed, and so on,

23:52.160 --> 23:56.880
Hans-Nina Murray repeatedly find that for the young respondents to the survey,

23:56.880 --> 24:02.800
AFQT score and by proxy IQ score is a more accurate predictor of life outcomes

24:02.800 --> 24:05.440
than a parent's socioeconomic status.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.400
Hans-Nina Murray conclude this section by stating that

24:08.400 --> 24:11.040
a smarter population is more likely to be

24:11.040 --> 24:15.280
and more capable of being made into a civil citizenry.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.560
Part three of the bell curve is titled The National Context

24:18.560 --> 24:21.520
and is where things start getting especially controversial.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.240
This is the section of the book where they discuss differences

24:24.240 --> 24:28.000
in cognitive ability across designated racial groups.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.520
They review published literature on differences in racial IQ scores

24:31.520 --> 24:34.640
and find substantial differences between the various groups.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.040
They discuss the ways in which tests can be biased,

24:37.040 --> 24:39.440
culturally and otherwise, but ultimately conclude

24:39.440 --> 24:43.120
that these group differences cannot be explained away by bias.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.080
In chapter 15, Hans-Nina Murray talk about how they think

24:46.080 --> 24:49.360
cognitive ability in the West is declining, stating,

24:49.360 --> 24:52.560
Throughout the West, modernization has brought falling birth rates.

24:52.560 --> 24:56.160
The rates fall faster for educated women than the uneducated.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.440
Because education is so closely linked with cognitive ability,

24:59.440 --> 25:02.160
this tends to produce a dysgenic effect

25:02.160 --> 25:05.120
or a downward shift in the ability distribution.

25:05.120 --> 25:08.320
Furthermore, education leads women to have their babies later,

25:08.320 --> 25:12.160
which alone also produces additional dysgenic pressure.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.640
Have you ever seen the movie Idiocracy?

25:14.640 --> 25:16.800
Because this is just that, basically.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.240
Lower IQ people have more children than higher IQ people,

25:20.240 --> 25:24.160
so therefore average IQ scores are going down.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.800
However, Hans-Nina Murray run into a problem here,

25:26.800 --> 25:30.560
which is that IQ scores had been going up, not down,

25:30.560 --> 25:33.760
in the decades prior to the publication of the bell curve.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.760
This is known as the Flynn Effect,

25:35.760 --> 25:39.440
named for intelligence researcher James R. Flynn, who documented it,

25:39.440 --> 25:41.520
and we will talk more about the bell curve's attempt

25:41.520 --> 25:44.000
to account for the Flynn Effect later on.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.920
Part four of the bell curve is titled

25:45.920 --> 25:49.120
Living Together and is Concerned with Social Policy.

25:49.120 --> 25:52.640
This is where Hans-Nina Murray start proposing political solutions

25:52.640 --> 25:56.240
to the various problems they outlined in the previous chapters.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.960
They discuss, and ultimately brand as ineffective,

25:58.960 --> 26:03.040
all contemporary attempts to help disadvantaged children succeed in life.

26:03.600 --> 26:07.440
Things like better nutrition, better schooling, a better home environment,

26:07.440 --> 26:12.320
all these things can possibly, temporarily make people smarter, to a degree.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.320
But in the end, Hans-Nina Murray conclude that they will all eventually

26:16.320 --> 26:19.760
run into a genetic limit that cannot be worked around.

26:19.760 --> 26:23.760
Far more money is spent in ineffective attempts to help the disadvantaged

26:23.760 --> 26:26.720
than is spent on the gifted, Hans-Nina Murray contend,

26:26.720 --> 26:30.400
and we should thus directly shift the resources upwards

26:30.400 --> 26:32.560
to support our best and brightest.

26:32.560 --> 26:35.680
And this quote is from the introduction to Chapter 18.

26:35.680 --> 26:39.680
Some federal funds now so exclusively focused on the disadvantaged

26:39.680 --> 26:42.640
should be reallocated to programs for the gifted.

26:42.640 --> 26:46.880
Affirmative action in schools, as it stands, should be scrapped, of course.

26:46.880 --> 26:52.240
Hans-Nina Murray argue for a sort of race-blind, score-based affirmative action.

26:52.240 --> 26:56.560
They still support colleges accepting applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds,

26:56.560 --> 27:00.400
but only if they have comparable test scores to the other applicants.

27:00.400 --> 27:03.360
Affirmative action in the job market should also be scrapped,

27:03.360 --> 27:06.640
with Hans-Nina Murray arguing that in pursuit of equality,

27:06.640 --> 27:09.200
we have actually already overshot it,

27:09.200 --> 27:13.600
and that black people actually attain better quality jobs than white people,

27:13.600 --> 27:16.480
once you account for their IQs, of course.

27:16.480 --> 27:19.840
Hans-Nina Murray argue for encouraging low IQ parents

27:19.840 --> 27:22.560
to have fewer children in a couple of different ways.

27:23.200 --> 27:27.360
Firstly, they argue for making marriage a prerequisite for parental rights,

27:27.360 --> 27:30.960
and they also support cutting off welfare for low-income mothers,

27:30.960 --> 27:34.000
stating that we urge generally that these policies,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.520
represented by the extensive network of cash and services

27:37.520 --> 27:41.440
for low-income women who have babies, be ended.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.960
They also argue more generally in favor of individualism,

27:44.960 --> 27:47.200
concluding Chapter 21 by writing,

27:47.200 --> 27:52.240
Individualism is not only America's heritage, it must be its future.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.520
Hans-Nina Murray conclude this part of the bell curve with the following.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.840
Inequality of endowments, including intelligence, is a reality.

27:59.840 --> 28:04.160
Trying to pretend that inequality does not really exist has led to disaster.

28:04.160 --> 28:09.600
Trying to eradicate inequality with artificially manufactured outcomes has led to disaster.

28:09.600 --> 28:14.880
It is time for America to once again try living with inequality as life is lived,

28:14.880 --> 28:19.040
understanding that each human being has strengths and weaknesses and so on.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.080
This is the end of the main text of the bell curve.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.360
Then follows seven appendices explaining various things,

28:25.360 --> 28:29.520
about the data and statistical methods used in the book, among other things.

28:29.520 --> 28:33.760
Additionally, newer versions of the bell curve contain an afterword written in response

28:33.760 --> 28:38.240
to various criticisms directed at the book by various scientists and journalists,

28:38.240 --> 28:41.280
and we will be quoting from that at several points later on.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.000
So then, that was the bell curve.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.640
And before we carry on here, I think it would be worthwhile

28:46.640 --> 28:50.160
to attempt to summarize the general argument of the book.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.920
So here is my understanding of it in four points.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.360
One, general intelligence, or G, exists.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.800
General intelligence is to some degree heritable, innate,

29:00.800 --> 29:04.560
unable to be significantly changed and unevenly distributed,

29:04.560 --> 29:07.120
both within and across population groups.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.840
Two, IQ tests measure G fairly and accurately.

29:12.560 --> 29:16.480
Three, one's IQ is more important than one's social background

29:16.480 --> 29:18.720
in determining one's life outcomes.

29:19.280 --> 29:22.560
And four, given what we can learn from these points,

29:22.560 --> 29:25.360
we should implement conservative social policies,

29:25.360 --> 29:28.800
such as limiting welfare, incentivizing marriage,

29:28.800 --> 29:31.360
abandoning affirmative action, and more broadly,

29:31.360 --> 29:35.840
we should promote a return to a more individualistic society.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.280
Now, I'm sure someone could disagree with the conservative adjective

29:39.280 --> 29:41.600
in this last point and argue that Herrnstein and Murray

29:41.600 --> 29:45.520
merely promote whatever policies seem to best address the problems they discuss.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.960
They propose better access to birth control, for instance,

29:48.960 --> 29:51.840
which is not typically a conservative policy.

29:51.840 --> 29:54.320
Overall, though, their policy recommendations

29:54.320 --> 29:56.960
definitely lean heavily to the right.

29:56.960 --> 30:00.400
So it's now time to begin looking at the counter arguments,

30:00.400 --> 30:02.880
and we will begin with point one on this list

30:02.880 --> 30:05.520
and talk about general intelligence.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.160
So if we want to understand general intelligence,

30:08.160 --> 30:10.720
we first need to understand the statistical technique

30:10.720 --> 30:14.400
by which it is calculated, factor analysis.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.720
And if we want to understand factor analysis,

30:16.720 --> 30:20.320
we first need to talk about correlation and causation.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.400
Starting with correlation, then.

30:22.400 --> 30:26.720
Correlation is basically statistical association.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.040
Stephen Jay Gould in The Mismeasure of Man

30:29.040 --> 30:30.720
describes it in the following way.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.160
Correlation assesses the tendency of one measure

30:34.160 --> 30:36.400
to vary in concert with another.

30:36.400 --> 30:40.560
As a child grows, for example, both its arms and legs get longer.

30:40.560 --> 30:43.840
This joint tendency to change in the same direction

30:43.840 --> 30:45.680
is called a positive correlation.

30:46.240 --> 30:50.880
Not all parts of the body display such positive correlation during growth.

30:50.880 --> 30:54.160
Teeth, for example, do not grow after they erupt.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.520
The relationship between first incisor length and leg length

30:57.520 --> 31:02.000
from, say, age 10 to adulthood would represent zero correlation.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.520
Legs would get longer while teeth changed not at all.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.680
Other correlations can be negative.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.640
One measure increases while the other decreases.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.760
We begin to lose neurons at a distressingly early age

31:13.760 --> 31:15.360
and they are not replaced.

31:15.360 --> 31:18.480
Thus, the relationship between leg length and number of neurons

31:18.480 --> 31:21.920
after mid-childhood represents negative correlation.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.520
Leg length increases while number of neurons decreases.

31:25.520 --> 31:28.240
And Gould also includes this handy illustration

31:28.240 --> 31:30.880
of some example correlation graphs here.

31:30.880 --> 31:34.800
Now, of course, leg length and arm length are positively correlated

31:34.800 --> 31:37.200
because they share an underlying cause,

31:37.200 --> 31:40.320
which is simply general biological growth.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.240
However, we can think of plenty of things

31:42.240 --> 31:45.680
that are positively correlated and do not share a cause.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.080
You might be familiar with the following examples

31:48.080 --> 31:51.920
from the page Spurious Correlations, which I will link below.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.840
Per capita cheese consumption correlates with number of people who died

31:55.840 --> 31:57.920
by becoming tangled in their bedsheets.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.240
Number of letters in winning word of Scripps National Spelling Bee

32:02.240 --> 32:06.960
correlates with number of people killed by venomous spiders, and so on.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.600
Obviously, these things have nothing to do with each other.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.120
Probably.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.520
So some correlations are just chance.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.880
It would be an error to assume a shared cause there.

32:16.880 --> 32:20.960
Correlation does not imply causation, is the saying.

32:20.960 --> 32:25.040
Now, in addition to assuming a shared cause when there is not one,

32:25.040 --> 32:29.600
another common mistake here is to ignore a shared cause when there is one.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.240
For example, when considering arm and leg length

32:32.240 --> 32:34.960
to ignore the underlying biological growth

32:34.960 --> 32:39.600
and assume that legs are getting longer because arms are, or vice versa.

32:39.600 --> 32:43.600
There are lots of different ways to misrepresent correlations, basically.

32:43.600 --> 32:48.800
I agree with Gould when he writes the invalid assumption that correlation implies cause

32:48.800 --> 32:54.240
is probably among the two or three most serious and common errors of human reasoning.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.800
Anyway, one result of us calculating the correlation between arm and leg lengths

32:58.800 --> 33:01.920
is that we have simplified the data somewhat.

33:01.920 --> 33:07.520
The strong correlation between the two variables means we can basically express them as one,

33:07.600 --> 33:11.520
so long as we don't mind losing a little information along the way.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.000
But what if instead of just two variables,

33:14.000 --> 33:19.680
we wanted to compare correlations between the size of, say, 50 different body parts?

33:19.680 --> 33:23.200
Plotting two measurements in a graph is fairly easy.

33:23.200 --> 33:27.680
With the addition of a third measurement, though, things start getting a little trickier.

33:27.680 --> 33:32.320
This figure from the Mismeasure of Man, where Gould introduces head measurements into the mix,

33:32.320 --> 33:36.320
needs another dimension in order to convey the information.

33:36.320 --> 33:40.320
And with more variables added in, the data quickly gets too complex

33:40.320 --> 33:43.040
to display with a mere three dimensions.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.760
And this brings us to factor analysis.

33:45.760 --> 33:49.680
Similar to how we simplified arm and leg length to a single dimension,

33:50.240 --> 33:55.440
factor analysis can be used to reduce a complex system of correlated variables

33:55.440 --> 33:58.880
to a smaller number of underlying factors.

33:58.880 --> 34:03.360
And you might find that just a few underlying factors explain the vast majority of the

34:03.360 --> 34:06.480
variations in a larger number of variables.

34:06.480 --> 34:11.440
And furthermore, you could identify which factor explained the majority of the variation.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.760
I won't be going into the exact specifics of how factor analysis works.

34:16.480 --> 34:21.040
I couldn't if I wanted to, to be honest, but this is basically how it is used.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.240
To quote Gould again,

34:22.240 --> 34:27.680
factor analysis is a mathematical technique for reducing a complex system of correlations

34:27.680 --> 34:29.280
into fewer dimensions.

34:29.840 --> 34:34.080
So you might be wondering, what does all this have to do with intelligence?

34:34.080 --> 34:40.160
Well, factor analysis is how psychologist Charles Spearman came up with the concept of the G factor.

34:40.720 --> 34:45.600
Spearman looked at a big mass of data showing that people scores on various intelligence tests

34:45.600 --> 34:49.760
were positively correlated, carried out a little factor analysis,

34:49.760 --> 34:53.920
and identified the most important underlying statistical factor.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.360
He then called this G, or general intelligence.

34:57.360 --> 35:03.840
So this G is the underlying general mental ability that we are supposedly measuring with IQ tests.

35:03.840 --> 35:07.440
However, there are a few problems with this G factor.

35:07.440 --> 35:10.000
One is, as the bell curve itself points out,

35:10.000 --> 35:14.800
that it's based on statistical analysis rather than direct observation.

35:14.800 --> 35:20.000
We are inferring its existence from the data rather than measuring it directly, basically.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.280
It is the result of a particular statistical method.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
Secondly, simplifying the majority of the data down to a single factor

35:28.000 --> 35:31.200
can actually obscure a lot of useful information.

35:31.200 --> 35:35.760
What if the data shows that people who do well on tests of numerical ability

35:35.760 --> 35:39.280
tend to do well on other tests of numerical ability,

35:39.280 --> 35:42.320
and people who do well on tests of their language ability

35:42.320 --> 35:46.000
tend to do better on other tests of language ability?

35:46.000 --> 35:51.120
We can imagine two people who are determined to be statistically as smart as each other,

35:51.120 --> 35:54.880
but who excel in completely different areas, right?

35:54.880 --> 35:57.600
And there are several different intelligence theories

35:57.600 --> 36:00.720
identifying different clusters of mental abilities.

36:00.720 --> 36:04.320
Verbal, logical, spatial, mathematical, whatever else.

36:04.320 --> 36:08.000
You can go and read about all of those if you're very bored.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.720
But what can we take away from our little chat about correlation and factor analysis here?

36:12.720 --> 36:17.680
Well, first of all, factor analysis tells us nothing about causation.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.840
It deals with correlations.

36:19.840 --> 36:24.240
It can show that there might be common factors underlying different variables,

36:24.240 --> 36:30.240
but it does not identify for us why those variables vary.

36:30.240 --> 36:35.360
As a comparison here, let's say you take a sample of 10,000 random members of the public

36:35.360 --> 36:39.360
and you test their athletic performance at various physical tests.

36:39.360 --> 36:44.240
Amount of weight lifted, length jumped, speed at running various distances,

36:44.240 --> 36:46.000
sit-ups completed, whatever.

36:46.640 --> 36:51.840
And let's say that what you find is that people who perform well on one test relative to the group

36:51.840 --> 36:55.360
tend to perform well on the other tests relative to the group

36:55.360 --> 36:57.760
and vice versa for those who perform poorly.

36:58.400 --> 37:02.560
Now you could, if you so fancied, subject this data to factor analysis.

37:02.560 --> 37:07.280
Identify numerically the most important underlying factor and name it F

37:07.280 --> 37:09.600
for general fitness or something.

37:09.600 --> 37:14.560
And you could probably further assign each person an FQ or fitness quotient.

37:14.560 --> 37:20.240
However, what you would not have done is explain why some people are fitter than others.

37:20.240 --> 37:24.080
You would have said nothing about the heritability of athletic performance,

37:24.080 --> 37:28.480
the degree to which genetics and environment contribute to athletic performance.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.320
You'd have said nothing about the causes of the data at all.

37:32.320 --> 37:37.520
It would be a leap of logic to assume that each person's FQ is innate and unchangeable.

37:37.520 --> 37:41.440
The data you have cannot tell you any such thing by itself.

37:41.440 --> 37:45.280
You may also find that your singular numerical fitness quotient

37:45.280 --> 37:47.760
obscures a lot of useful information.

37:47.760 --> 37:51.520
For instance, you might find people who are better at strength exercises

37:51.520 --> 37:54.800
tend to be better at other strength exercises and so on.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.320
So the mere existence of a general factor of cognitive ability

37:58.320 --> 38:01.600
would not explain why there are differences between people.

38:02.240 --> 38:05.280
In fact, the G factor is perfectly consistent

38:05.280 --> 38:10.000
with a 100% environmental approach to understanding intelligence.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.240
We could play devil's advocate here and say,

38:12.240 --> 38:16.480
yes, a general factor of intelligence exists and is important,

38:16.480 --> 38:22.320
but the variance in G between people is explained entirely by environmental factors.

38:22.320 --> 38:27.360
Childhood nutrition, socioeconomic status, school quality, and so on.

38:27.360 --> 38:30.640
Absolutely nothing happens in the factor analysis process

38:30.640 --> 38:36.240
to tell us about what the causes are for people having different measurable levels of intelligence.

38:36.320 --> 38:40.240
And even if we accept a single general intelligence factor exists,

38:40.240 --> 38:44.400
that would not necessarily imply a genetic causation.

38:44.400 --> 38:48.960
And speaking of genetics, let's next talk about the word heritability.

38:49.600 --> 38:50.960
When the bell curve says,

38:50.960 --> 38:53.760
cognitive ability is substantially heritable,

38:53.760 --> 38:56.800
apparently no less than 40% and no more than 80%,

38:57.680 --> 38:59.360
what does that mean exactly?

38:59.360 --> 39:02.320
If we average it for 60%, like they do,

39:02.320 --> 39:05.920
are we therefore to assume that each person's individual IQ

39:05.920 --> 39:11.200
is 60% determined by heritable genetics and 40% by the environment?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.680
Well, no.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.960
Heritability is unfortunately one of those awkward words

39:16.960 --> 39:21.200
which has a common use understanding and a scientific understanding

39:21.200 --> 39:23.840
which differ in a few important ways.

39:23.840 --> 39:26.240
The common use understanding is something like

39:26.240 --> 39:30.160
the ability of a thing to be passed down genetically, right?

39:30.160 --> 39:33.360
You can inherit being tall or having red hair,

39:33.360 --> 39:38.240
but you can't inherit a scar or a finger lost in an accident, say.

39:38.240 --> 39:42.320
The technical academic meaning of heritability is rather different.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.760
Heritability is a numerical concept used to estimate

39:45.760 --> 39:51.440
the contribution of genetic variance to overall variance of a trait within a group.

39:51.440 --> 39:54.720
So basically, heritability estimates the degree to which

39:54.720 --> 39:59.440
the variance of a trait within a group is due to genetics.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.160
Height is thus a heritable trait.

40:02.160 --> 40:05.680
Taller parents will generally have taller offspring, for example,

40:05.680 --> 40:08.560
and this is measurable against a population group.

40:09.360 --> 40:13.680
Having two arms, however, is not a heritable trait

40:13.680 --> 40:16.720
because almost everyone has two arms.

40:16.720 --> 40:18.960
And for people who don't have two arms,

40:18.960 --> 40:22.400
that variance is usually environmental in nature.

40:22.400 --> 40:25.520
Having two arms is genetically determined,

40:25.520 --> 40:28.320
but it is not a heritable trait if you follow

40:28.320 --> 40:31.440
because genes account for very little of the variance

40:31.440 --> 40:33.360
within the population group.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.520
Something that is very highly heritable,

40:35.520 --> 40:38.320
we would say has a heritability of one.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.320
Something that is not heritable at all,

40:40.320 --> 40:42.720
we would say has a heritability of zero.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.640
If we say something has a heritability of 0.6,

40:46.640 --> 40:50.960
then what we mean there is that 60% of the variance of the trait

40:50.960 --> 40:54.720
in a population group will be due to genetic factors.

40:55.280 --> 40:59.760
What it does not mean is that 60% of the trait in one individual

40:59.760 --> 41:04.000
is due to their genes and 40% due to the environment.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.440
Heritability tells us about variance within a group,

41:08.080 --> 41:10.480
not the makeup of individuals.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.560
It is a population statistic.

41:12.560 --> 41:17.040
You cannot meaningfully ask what the heritability of your IQ is.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.400
So where am I going with this?

41:18.400 --> 41:21.040
Well, there's a couple of points that I'd like to make.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.640
The first is that a trait can be determined by your genes

41:24.640 --> 41:28.880
and be very lowly heritable, such as the presence of arms,

41:28.880 --> 41:30.560
and also the inverse of that.

41:30.560 --> 41:33.120
A trait could be very highly heritable

41:33.120 --> 41:36.240
and not directly genetically determined.

41:36.240 --> 41:39.600
One common example used to illustrate this is earrings.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.400
What would we say accounts for the variance

41:42.400 --> 41:45.520
in whether people wear earrings within a particular group?

41:46.080 --> 41:48.080
Well, depending on the group,

41:48.080 --> 41:51.040
most of the variance could be due, in one sense,

41:51.040 --> 41:54.160
to a genetic factor, biological sex.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.920
Wearing earrings would therefore be a heritable trait,

41:57.920 --> 42:00.720
but this does not mean that there is an earring gene

42:00.720 --> 42:03.040
that is being passed down generationally.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.920
The majority of people wearing earrings being women

42:05.920 --> 42:10.160
would be due to environmental factors, fashion and gender roles,

42:10.160 --> 42:12.240
which are subject to change over time.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.560
In more recent years, for example,

42:14.560 --> 42:17.840
men in the West have increasingly been wearing earrings.

42:17.840 --> 42:22.480
The heritability of the trait of wearing earrings is thus decreasing,

42:22.480 --> 42:26.480
because less of the variance is being accounted for by genetics.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.680
But crucially here,

42:27.680 --> 42:32.000
nothing is actually happening genetically on the earring front.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.720
The change in heritability is down to changing environmental factors.

42:36.720 --> 42:39.360
When we say something is due to genetics,

42:39.360 --> 42:42.720
we need to be very careful about exactly what we mean.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.960
A useful categorization here is

42:44.960 --> 42:48.720
direct versus indirect genetic determination.

42:48.720 --> 42:51.280
We need to be sure to differentiate between things

42:51.280 --> 42:54.160
that are directly genetically determined,

42:54.160 --> 42:58.160
as in your genes are directly causing some biochemical process

42:58.160 --> 42:59.440
to happen within you,

42:59.440 --> 43:02.400
and things that are indirectly genetically determined,

43:02.400 --> 43:06.320
as a result of your genes interacting with your environment.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.960
Women being more likely to wear earrings, for instance,

43:08.960 --> 43:10.640
is a heritable trait,

43:10.640 --> 43:14.000
but it is not directly genetically determined.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.840
This is relevant to us because IQ could be such a trait,

43:17.840 --> 43:20.960
where differences in IQ across designated racial groups

43:20.960 --> 43:24.240
are caused not by a direct genetic process,

43:24.240 --> 43:27.840
but instead by how our genetically determined characteristics

43:27.840 --> 43:30.000
interact with our environment,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.520
so as to affect our results on IQ tests.

43:33.520 --> 43:34.240
For example,

43:34.240 --> 43:38.320
let's imagine your genes cause you to have a particular skin color,

43:38.320 --> 43:40.560
and you live in a segregated society

43:40.560 --> 43:43.920
in which people with that skin color are discriminated against

43:43.920 --> 43:46.560
and do not have equal access to education.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.760
Now that group's lower results on IQ tests

43:49.760 --> 43:52.960
would be, in one sense, because of their genes.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.200
And scientists studying genetics

43:55.200 --> 43:57.520
might very well find a strong correlation

43:57.520 --> 44:01.520
between particular genes and lowered IQ test results,

44:01.520 --> 44:04.800
but if we don't take the environment into account,

44:04.800 --> 44:07.440
that by itself can't tell us anything.

44:07.440 --> 44:10.720
The point here is that a trait could be very highly heritable

44:10.720 --> 44:13.360
and correlated strongly with particular genes

44:13.360 --> 44:17.040
and still have zero direct genetic determination.

44:17.040 --> 44:19.040
Now the idea that wearing earrings

44:19.040 --> 44:22.080
can be more of a heritable trait than having ears

44:22.080 --> 44:25.520
is admittedly a bit of a difficult concept to grasp at first sight,

44:25.520 --> 44:27.600
and I would understand if it took a little time

44:27.600 --> 44:29.920
for someone to wrap their head around all this.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.720
Right now, though, what I want you to take away from this section,

44:32.720 --> 44:33.600
if nothing else,

44:33.600 --> 44:36.400
is the idea that something being heritable

44:36.400 --> 44:41.680
does not necessarily mean it is actually being directly caused by genetics.

44:41.680 --> 44:45.840
My next point is that heritability estimates the causes of variants

44:45.840 --> 44:46.960
within a group.

44:47.520 --> 44:52.000
It cannot tell us about reasons for differences across groups.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.040
And to illustrate this,

44:53.040 --> 44:57.360
we will paraphrase a thought experiment by geneticist Richard Lewontin.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.360
Let's say we take a packet of seeds

44:59.360 --> 45:03.520
and plant them in fertilized soil in a controlled laboratory environment,

45:03.520 --> 45:06.000
and we ensure that the growing plants have sufficient

45:06.000 --> 45:08.800
and equal amounts of water and light.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.800
And doesn't that sound nice?

45:10.800 --> 45:15.040
Now height in plants is a heritable trait, just like in humans,

45:15.040 --> 45:18.720
and the plants would thus grow to a range of different heights.

45:18.720 --> 45:22.560
Height in this experiment would be very highly heritable,

45:22.560 --> 45:26.400
because the fact we're ensuring the plants have an equal environment

45:26.400 --> 45:29.200
means that the variance in heights in the group

45:29.200 --> 45:31.440
is solely down to genetics.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.920
Next, let's say we do that experiment again,

45:33.920 --> 45:36.560
only this time we plant the seeds in bad soil

45:36.560 --> 45:41.440
and give them less but equal within the group amounts of water and light.

45:41.440 --> 45:45.440
The thing to understand here is that height in this second experiment

45:45.440 --> 45:49.440
would be exactly as heritable as in the previous experiment.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.240
All of the plants from the second group have the same group environment,

45:54.240 --> 45:56.960
meaning that, again, the group variance in heights

45:56.960 --> 45:59.360
would be solely down to genetics.

45:59.360 --> 46:02.480
The poor environment will produce smaller plants,

46:02.480 --> 46:06.160
but since they are all subject to that environment equally,

46:06.160 --> 46:08.240
heritability remains high.

46:08.240 --> 46:12.400
The problems arise when we start trying to compare these two groups.

46:12.400 --> 46:15.200
Let's say the second group of plants has an average height

46:15.200 --> 46:18.880
that is 15% shorter than the first group, for instance.

46:18.880 --> 46:23.200
The heritability of height tells us nothing about why that is.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.240
Heritability was the same across both groups.

46:26.240 --> 46:30.320
If you're trying to figure out why one group of plants grew larger than the other,

46:30.320 --> 46:34.400
saying height is heritable tells us nothing useful.

46:34.400 --> 46:38.720
The difference between the groups was entirely down to environmental factors,

46:38.720 --> 46:43.040
and heritability, despite being high, played no part.

46:43.040 --> 46:45.920
The two points we can take from this thought experiment are,

46:45.920 --> 46:50.560
firstly, the heritability of traits does not account for group differences,

46:50.560 --> 46:54.160
and secondly, a trait having a high heritability

46:54.160 --> 46:59.120
does not mean that trait is immutable or unaffected by the environment.

46:59.120 --> 47:03.520
For another example of this, height in humans is a highly heritable trait,

47:03.520 --> 47:07.360
but the average human height increased substantially over the last century,

47:07.360 --> 47:09.680
and this was due to environmental changes,

47:09.680 --> 47:12.160
such as better health care and nutrition.

47:12.160 --> 47:13.600
Or for another example,

47:13.600 --> 47:18.080
North Koreans are, on average, a few inches shorter than South Koreans,

47:18.080 --> 47:22.480
and this is down to the different material conditions in those two countries,

47:22.480 --> 47:26.000
not some recent radical divergence in genetics.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.960
Height is heritable in both North and South Korea,

47:28.960 --> 47:33.280
but it's the environment that is the cause of the variance between the groups.

47:33.840 --> 47:37.120
This is something that the bell curve crucially misunderstands

47:37.120 --> 47:41.120
when talking about the heritability of intelligence and IQ.

47:41.120 --> 47:42.880
On page 109, they say,

47:42.880 --> 47:47.200
even a heritability of 0.6 leaves room for considerable change

47:47.200 --> 47:50.720
if the changes in environments are commensurably large,

47:50.720 --> 47:53.680
the implication here being that higher heritabilities

47:53.680 --> 47:56.960
would be less affected by changes in the environment,

47:56.960 --> 47:59.200
and this is just not how it works.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.440
IQ could be 100% heritable

48:01.440 --> 48:04.720
and still massively affected by changes in the group environment.

48:04.720 --> 48:07.680
Professor Ned Block from New York University

48:07.680 --> 48:10.160
makes several of these points about heritability

48:10.160 --> 48:14.320
in an article entitled How Heritability Misleads About Race,

48:14.320 --> 48:15.520
and then goes on to say,

48:15.520 --> 48:19.120
I hope these points remove the temptation exhibited in the bell curve

48:19.120 --> 48:23.840
to think of the heritability of IQ as a constant, like the speed of light.

48:23.840 --> 48:26.400
Heritability is a population statistic,

48:26.400 --> 48:28.640
just like birth rate or number of TVs,

48:28.640 --> 48:32.160
and can be expected to change with changing circumstances.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.920
These issues are pathetically misunderstood by Charles Murray.

48:35.920 --> 48:38.960
In a CNN interview reported in the New Republic,

48:38.960 --> 48:40.000
Murray declared,

48:40.000 --> 48:43.600
when I, when we, say 60% heritability,

48:43.600 --> 48:46.080
it's not 60% of the variation,

48:46.080 --> 48:50.080
it is 60% of the IQ in any given person.

48:50.080 --> 48:52.720
Later, he repeated that for the average person,

48:52.720 --> 48:56.320
60% of the intelligence comes from heredity,

48:56.320 --> 48:59.520
and added that this was true of the human species,

48:59.520 --> 49:03.040
missing the point that heritability makes no sense for an individual

49:03.040 --> 49:06.480
and that heritability statistics are population relative.

49:06.480 --> 49:09.600
So if you don't quite understand all this stuff about heritability,

49:09.600 --> 49:13.840
don't feel too bad because Charles Murray doesn't understand it either.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.240
Or at least he didn't 25 years ago,

49:16.240 --> 49:18.960
he may have done his homework since then, who knows.

49:18.960 --> 49:22.320
Looking again at the bell curve's list of claims about intelligence,

49:22.320 --> 49:27.760
the only one on here that could be said to be making a point about genetics is number six.

49:27.760 --> 49:31.040
Cognitive ability is substantially heritable.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.240
However, as we've seen,

49:32.240 --> 49:37.360
a trait being heritable does not necessarily mean a direct genetic cause.

49:37.360 --> 49:42.400
It does not tell us anything about the heritability of a particular individual's intelligence,

49:42.400 --> 49:46.880
and it cannot tell us the reason for differences between groups of people.

49:46.880 --> 49:51.200
Those differences between people could be caused by environmental factors,

49:51.200 --> 49:55.520
because, twist, environments are heritable too.

49:55.520 --> 49:57.680
As the bell curve itself points out,

49:57.680 --> 50:01.520
non-genetic characteristics can nonetheless run in families.

50:01.520 --> 50:05.440
For practical purposes, environments are heritable too.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.680
So to summarize this section,

50:07.680 --> 50:12.080
we have considered the method by which a general intelligence factor is determined,

50:12.080 --> 50:14.800
and also claims about its heritability.

50:14.800 --> 50:17.200
But we can conclude from neither of these things

50:17.200 --> 50:22.640
that the variance in intelligence between groups of people has a direct genetic cause.

50:22.640 --> 50:25.920
The cause could simply be directly due to the environment,

50:25.920 --> 50:30.160
or indirectly by way of how genes are interacting with that environment.

50:30.720 --> 50:32.960
So why am I listing off all the ways in which

50:32.960 --> 50:38.400
Hanstein and Murray do not prove a genetic cause for cognitive ability, you might ask.

50:38.400 --> 50:41.680
Their later comparisons of IQ and environmental factors

50:41.680 --> 50:45.040
assume that IQ is largely genetic in origin,

50:45.040 --> 50:48.640
so presumably they do prove it at some point, right?

50:48.640 --> 50:51.040
Well, to put it bluntly, no.

50:51.040 --> 50:54.160
In their section, How Much Is IQ a Matter of Genes?,

50:54.160 --> 50:58.720
they estimate the heritability of IQ scores by talking about twin studies.

50:59.280 --> 51:04.400
We can use studies of identical twins, non-identical twins, and regular siblings

51:04.400 --> 51:07.600
to estimate the extent of genetic effects upon IQ

51:07.600 --> 51:13.120
by noting the differences in correlations between their scores on intelligence tests.

51:13.120 --> 51:15.520
However, there are a few problems with this.

51:15.520 --> 51:18.800
Most importantly for us here being that in attempting to learn about

51:18.800 --> 51:22.560
genetic cognitive ability via intelligence test scores,

51:22.560 --> 51:25.280
we have to make the assumption that intelligence tests

51:25.280 --> 51:28.320
are an accurate measure of cognitive ability.

51:28.320 --> 51:30.240
But more on that in a moment.

51:30.240 --> 51:35.360
Even if we assume that the tests do give an accurate representation of cognitive ability,

51:35.360 --> 51:40.400
attempts to use these correlations to construct a simple genetic model for IQ

51:40.400 --> 51:41.920
run into several issues.

51:42.480 --> 51:46.560
Firstly, the IQs of identical twins do not perfectly correlate,

51:46.560 --> 51:50.400
as we would expect them to, given their nearly identical genetics.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.280
The correlation of siblings who were raised apart is weaker

51:53.280 --> 51:56.240
than the correlation of siblings who were raised together.

51:56.240 --> 52:00.080
And probably most troublesome for a purely genetic model here

52:00.080 --> 52:05.280
is that there is also some correlation between parents and adopted children.

52:05.280 --> 52:07.360
Their scores correlate to some degree,

52:07.360 --> 52:13.120
despite there being no immediate genetic link beyond being the same species, of course.

52:13.120 --> 52:17.440
So in our search for exactly how much genetics affects cognitive ability,

52:17.440 --> 52:20.960
these observations are only ever going to get us so far.

52:20.960 --> 52:26.320
It's very difficult to disentangle the genetic effects from the environmental ones.

52:26.320 --> 52:30.080
What we really need here is genetics research to advance to the point

52:30.080 --> 52:33.680
where we understand exactly which genes influence intelligence

52:33.680 --> 52:36.080
and to which degree they influence intelligence.

52:36.720 --> 52:39.920
When the bell curve was published, the evidence was not there.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.760
As Herndstein and Murray admit,

52:41.760 --> 52:45.360
the state of knowledge does not permit a precise estimate.

52:45.360 --> 52:50.240
And in 2019, 25 years later, the evidence is still not there.

52:50.240 --> 52:52.960
If anything, with regards to the claims in the bell curve,

52:52.960 --> 52:55.760
particularly its claims about racial differences,

52:55.760 --> 52:59.040
the genetic story has only gotten more complicated.

52:59.040 --> 53:04.240
The reason I say designated racial groups instead of racial groups during this video

53:04.240 --> 53:06.000
is because on a genetic level,

53:06.000 --> 53:10.560
our skin color folk understanding of racial groups can be unhelpful.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.720
There can be greater genetic differences

53:12.720 --> 53:16.480
within our socially constructed racial groups than between them.

53:16.480 --> 53:20.960
I doubt anyone would be so naive as to expect us to one day identify

53:20.960 --> 53:25.440
the singular gene that controls both skin color and intelligence.

53:26.000 --> 53:31.200
Someone having dark skin and thus being identified and identifying as black

53:31.200 --> 53:33.840
could have a whole range of genetic history.

53:33.840 --> 53:37.840
You can't read someone's genes by looking at their skin color.

53:37.840 --> 53:41.120
This is important for us because the authors of the bell curve

53:41.120 --> 53:44.720
use our socially constructed racial groups in their book.

53:44.720 --> 53:46.480
Talking about this, they say,

53:46.480 --> 53:49.760
what does it mean to be black in America in racial terms

53:49.760 --> 53:52.720
when the word black or African-American can be used

53:52.720 --> 53:56.400
for people whose ancestry is more European than African?

53:56.400 --> 53:59.680
How are we to classify a person whose parents hail from Panama

53:59.680 --> 54:02.480
but whose ancestry is predominantly African?

54:02.480 --> 54:05.040
Is he a Latino, a black?

54:05.600 --> 54:08.160
The rule we follow here is to classify people

54:08.160 --> 54:11.600
according to the way they classify themselves.

54:11.600 --> 54:15.200
It would be a leap of logic to assume genetic explanations

54:15.200 --> 54:18.640
for characteristics of self-identified groups,

54:18.640 --> 54:22.560
given that those groups could have a wide range of genetic makeups.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.600
My point with all this is that the bell curve's direct evidence

54:25.600 --> 54:28.880
of a genetic basis for IQ is missing.

54:28.880 --> 54:31.360
Charles Murray's attitude towards this problem

54:31.440 --> 54:33.760
in the years since the publication of the book

54:33.760 --> 54:36.160
has been to kick the can down the road,

54:36.160 --> 54:39.840
assuming that he and Herrnstein were prematurely right,

54:39.840 --> 54:42.880
to borrow a phrase from his afterword to the bell curve,

54:42.880 --> 54:46.880
and that the accumulating genetic evidence will prove him right

54:46.880 --> 54:49.760
if everyone just waits a little longer.

54:49.760 --> 54:53.120
And it remains his tactic more than two decades later.

54:53.120 --> 54:55.920
In October of this year, Professor Ewan Birney,

54:55.920 --> 54:59.200
the director of the European Bioinformatics Institute,

54:59.200 --> 55:00.960
published a blog post titled

55:00.960 --> 55:04.240
Race, Genetics and Pseudoscience, an explainer,

55:04.240 --> 55:06.000
which discusses, among other things,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.480
how our traditional racial categorizations

55:08.480 --> 55:12.160
are not reflected in actual patterns of genetic variation,

55:12.160 --> 55:16.160
how distinct groups within Africa can be as distinct from each other

55:16.160 --> 55:18.080
as they are with non-Africans,

55:18.080 --> 55:22.240
how race is not a useful or accurate term for geneticists,

55:22.240 --> 55:25.520
and it says that it is often suggested that geneticists

55:25.520 --> 55:28.400
who emphasize the biological invalidity of race

55:28.400 --> 55:31.200
are under the form of political correctness,

55:31.200 --> 55:33.360
forced to suppress their real opinions

55:33.360 --> 55:36.560
in order to maintain their positions in the academy.

55:36.560 --> 55:38.800
Such accusations are unfounded

55:38.800 --> 55:42.560
and betray a lack of understanding of what motivates science.

55:42.560 --> 55:46.080
Charles Murray responded to this post on Twitter a few days later,

55:46.080 --> 55:46.640
saying,

55:46.640 --> 55:50.000
I can't understand why people are so eager to go public

55:50.000 --> 55:53.440
with positions for which the weight of the accumulating evidence

55:53.440 --> 55:54.800
is so unwelcome

55:54.800 --> 55:58.640
and that will be definitively settled within a few years.

55:58.640 --> 56:03.680
So it seems the evidence for Murray is still just a few years away.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.840
With regards to the bell curve, however,

56:05.840 --> 56:08.480
it is possible we are being a little unfair

56:08.480 --> 56:11.440
when we criticize it for basing much of its analysis

56:11.440 --> 56:13.520
on relatively crude estimations.

56:14.080 --> 56:16.800
After all, they do admit the evidence is not there,

56:16.800 --> 56:17.520
and they say,

56:17.520 --> 56:21.600
if the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation

56:21.600 --> 56:23.760
has won out to the exclusion of the other,

56:23.760 --> 56:27.600
we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other.

56:28.240 --> 56:31.040
We should not criticize scientists for saying,

56:31.040 --> 56:34.480
the evidence isn't there yet, but here's a rough guess.

56:34.480 --> 56:37.520
Presenting such estimates and attempting to disprove them

56:37.520 --> 56:39.840
is a key part of the scientific process.

56:40.480 --> 56:44.720
Problems arise when we get to part four of the bell curve, however.

56:44.720 --> 56:46.320
While it is fine to say,

56:46.320 --> 56:49.520
the evidence isn't there yet, but here's a rough guess,

56:49.520 --> 56:51.280
it is not so fine to say,

56:51.280 --> 56:53.120
the evidence isn't there yet,

56:53.120 --> 56:54.560
here's a rough guess.

56:54.560 --> 56:56.320
And based upon this rough guess,

56:56.320 --> 56:59.280
you should immediately suspend welfare programs

56:59.280 --> 57:01.440
for underprivileged children.

57:01.440 --> 57:03.120
But we'll talk more about this later

57:03.120 --> 57:05.600
when we discuss the politics of the bell curve.

57:05.600 --> 57:08.400
For now, though, let's address the assumption I mentioned earlier

57:08.400 --> 57:10.240
when talking about twin studies.

57:10.240 --> 57:11.760
We have been in this section

57:11.760 --> 57:15.440
assuming that we can measure native intelligence accurately.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.920
If we cannot measure native intelligence accurately,

57:17.920 --> 57:21.040
then much of what we've talked about thus far is irrelevant.

57:21.040 --> 57:24.400
So it's now time to talk about IQ tests.

57:24.400 --> 57:28.000
So I summarized the bell curve's claims about IQ tests

57:28.000 --> 57:32.160
as IQ tests measure G fairly and accurately.

57:32.160 --> 57:34.400
I wrote fairly because of their statement,

57:34.400 --> 57:37.680
properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased

57:37.680 --> 57:40.720
against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.

57:40.720 --> 57:43.520
And I wrote the word accurately because of their statement

57:43.520 --> 57:46.880
that all standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement

57:46.880 --> 57:49.200
measure this general factor to some degree,

57:49.200 --> 57:52.560
but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose

57:52.560 --> 57:54.640
measure it most accurately.

57:54.640 --> 57:56.480
So firstly here, we're going to discuss

57:56.480 --> 57:59.600
a few of the possible problems with IQ tests,

57:59.600 --> 58:01.200
starting with the various ways

58:01.200 --> 58:03.840
in which they can deliver biased results.

58:03.840 --> 58:07.120
Now, direct cultural bias in IQ test items

58:07.120 --> 58:10.400
is discussed by Herrnstein and Murray in chapter 13.

58:10.400 --> 58:13.920
They use an example of a question that includes the word regata,

58:13.920 --> 58:16.160
which is a word that might bias the results

58:16.160 --> 58:19.280
towards certain cultural and economic groups.

58:19.280 --> 58:22.880
And certain historical so-called intelligence test questions

58:22.880 --> 58:24.720
have actually been much worse than this.

58:25.280 --> 58:29.040
Some of them amounted to nothing more than general knowledge questions.

58:29.040 --> 58:31.600
The army alpha test used in World War I

58:31.600 --> 58:33.440
asked army recruits to identify

58:33.440 --> 58:36.320
what particular celebrities were famous for,

58:36.320 --> 58:39.440
in which cities certain cars were manufactured,

58:39.440 --> 58:42.320
and the products produced by certain brands.

58:42.320 --> 58:45.120
Questions like these obviously have very little to do

58:45.120 --> 58:47.280
with any native intellectual ability,

58:47.280 --> 58:48.800
they're just testing whether or not

58:48.800 --> 58:51.760
you happen to already know the answer.

58:51.760 --> 58:54.160
There's no opportunity to work it out,

58:54.160 --> 58:57.600
so any psychometricians constructing intelligence tests

58:57.600 --> 58:58.880
certainly need to be careful

58:58.880 --> 59:02.400
to not include biased test items like these ones.

59:02.400 --> 59:05.360
Tests can also be biased for instruction.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.440
And what do we mean by instruction here?

59:07.440 --> 59:09.680
Well, simply whether or not you've been taught

59:09.680 --> 59:10.800
the meaning of a word

59:10.800 --> 59:13.520
or the best method for solving a maths problem

59:13.520 --> 59:15.200
is going to matter a lot on a test

59:15.200 --> 59:17.680
that requires you to draw upon your mathematical

59:17.680 --> 59:19.200
and language abilities.

59:19.200 --> 59:20.480
As an example here,

59:20.480 --> 59:22.400
I'm gonna assume that we all agree

59:22.400 --> 59:25.120
it would be unfair to expect a random teenager

59:25.120 --> 59:27.840
to, by themselves, during a test,

59:27.840 --> 59:29.760
invent trigonometry.

59:29.760 --> 59:31.920
If you include trigonometry questions

59:31.920 --> 59:33.520
on your intelligence test,

59:33.520 --> 59:34.880
what you'll be testing for there

59:34.880 --> 59:37.760
will not solely be the intelligence of the respondent,

59:37.760 --> 59:39.680
but also whether or not they've been taught

59:39.680 --> 59:41.280
trigonometry before,

59:41.280 --> 59:43.200
how recently they were taught it,

59:43.280 --> 59:45.360
and how well they were taught it.

59:45.360 --> 59:46.880
This is relevant for us here

59:46.880 --> 59:49.200
because the Armed Forces Qualifying Test,

59:49.200 --> 59:52.240
which is the primary source of intelligence test data

59:52.240 --> 59:53.280
in the bell curve,

59:53.280 --> 59:55.040
had as one of its four sections

59:55.040 --> 59:57.440
a mathematics test which included questions

59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.120
examining knowledge of classroom trigonometry and algebra.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.000
This is more of a test of scholastic aptitude

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.520
than native intelligence,

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.280
and is also testing by proxy

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.080
the quality of the teaching at the different schools

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.240
that the AFQT respondents went to.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.480
We can't assume that to be equal

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.960
across thousands of different people, can we?

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.440
This is one of a few problems with the AFQT

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.720
that has roots in the fact

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.280
that it was not designed as an IQ test,

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.120
but more on that in a second.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.640
Another way that IQ tests can be biased is for speed.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.720
Think of the definitions of intelligence

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.840
we've seen so far.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.120
A capacity for complex mental work,

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.440
catching on, making sense of things,

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.440
and figuring out what to do.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.680
And simply because of the way IQ tests

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.480
are administered,

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.920
we have to add the words

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.800
within the time constraints of an academic test

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.320
to all of those things.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.160
IQ tests are by their nature

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.480
biased towards how fast you can think

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.560
and away from other important qualities

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.280
which contribute to overall cognitive ability

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.720
such as stamina, determination, and discipline.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.760
Similar to that point,

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.920
IQ tests have a more general bias

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.280
towards familiarity with an academic environment.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.440
People unfamiliar with taking tests

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.720
are going to fare worse

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.560
than people who are very used to it

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.600
simply due to being in an unfamiliar environment.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.760
Things like anxiety and stress

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.040
come into play here.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.120
Those can affect intelligence test results

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.800
despite having nothing directly

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.960
to do with intelligence themselves.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.000
Herrnstein and Murray

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.480
are particularly aware of that last point,

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.760
and we need to briefly discuss

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.280
the Flynn effect here.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.360
So when IQ tests are constructed,

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.560
they're standardized using a sample of test takers.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.000
Now what that means in practice

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.080
is the testers will test some people,

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.760
work out the average score,

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.560
and set that to correspond to 100.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.800
This is why we recognize an IQ of 100 as the average.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.040
When those IQ tests are later revised

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.360
or when new IQ tests are designed,

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.840
they're also standardized on new groups of people

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.640
and their average is set again to 100.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.720
However, researchers noticed

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.160
that when newer test subjects

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.400
take the older versions of a test,

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.520
their IQ scores are on average higher.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.640
So IQ scores have gone up over time, basically,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.160
meaning if you believe that IQ tests measure intelligence,

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.440
then people must be getting more intelligent, right?

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.440
This is troublesome for Herrnstein and Murray

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.120
because they argue the opposite,

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.840
that cognitive ability is deteriorating.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.360
And this brings us back to our point

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.160
about bias towards an academic environment.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.520
Addressing the Flynn effect,

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.680
Herrnstein and Murray write the following.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.520
There is a further question to answer.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.360
Does a 15-point IQ difference

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.440
between grandparents and their grandchildren

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.320
mean that the grandchildren are 15 points smarter?

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.200
Some experts do not believe that the rise is holy,

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.240
perhaps not even partly a rise in intelligence,

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.840
but in the narrower skills

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.040
involved in intelligence test-taking per se.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.240
So this, if it were true,

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.520
would mean that people are actually getting less intelligent,

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.960
but at the same time,

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.240
they are getting better at taking IQ tests.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.520
Now, you might say, isn't that a huge contradiction?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.920
Aren't they basically admitting that IQ tests

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.200
measure something other than inborn intelligence?

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.000
After all, if IQ tests supposedly measure

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.400
native cognitive ability accurately,

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.160
how could scores be going up

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.800
while cognitive ability is going down?

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.960
However, to be fair to Herrnstein and Murray,

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.800
it would be hasty to dismiss

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.440
their dysgenics hypothesis outright.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.520
There is another possibility here,

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:31.040
and it's that people are getting genetically less intelligent,

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.920
but the environmental factors affecting intelligence

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.320
have undergone such large changes

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.800
that their positive effects upon IQ

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.160
are more than accounting

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.720
for the downward genetic ability shift.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.000
So roughly, we would have lost a genetic IQ point

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.280
thanks to dysgenics,

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.880
but gained two back thanks to a better environment.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.120
So what evidence does the bell curve produce

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.040
in support of this downward trend

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.200
in genetic cognitive ability?

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.600
Well, unfortunately for Herrnstein and Murray,

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.040
their main source of data,

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.680
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.120
is not much use here.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.800
Ideally, what we want to do is give IQ tests

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.000
to the children of women who took part in the AFQT,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.880
so we could directly compare child to parent

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.600
and see if any downwards shift was happening.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.280
However, this would be a mistake,

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.720
as since our data is coming

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.000
from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.800
the respondents are, appropriately, young.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.440
People who wait longer to have children

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.160
are typically wealthier and better educated,

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.280
and thus tend to have children with higher IQs.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.560
Limiting ourselves to looking at only young mothers

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.880
will skew the apparent IQ of the next generation downwards,

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.040
so it would be an inaccurate thing to do.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.440
Herrnstein and Murray are, thankfully,

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.960
well aware of this problem.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.880
Not that it stops them from trying, however.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.440
Herrnstein and Murray's dysgenics hypothesis

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:59.040
is discussed in Intelligence, Genes, and Success,

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.520
Scientists Respond to the Bell Curve,

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.600
a 1997 book which responds to many of the points

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.040
made in the Bell Curve.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.960
The authors of that book, for their part,

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.120
find no direct empirical evidence,

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.680
either for or against a dysgenic effect

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.760
acting upon cognitive ability,

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.320
stating that, insofar as we are aware,

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.920
there is nothing but anecdotal evidence for dysgenics.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.920
Anyway, let's get back on track.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.280
Now, to illustrate another way IQ tests can be biased,

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.360
I think it would be a good exercise for us all

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.600
to briefly take a very simple one-question test together.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.240
So get your pencil and paper ready, folks.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:36.880
Here it is.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.200
Easy, right?

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.320
An incredibly simple number sequence question there,

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.440
the sort you'd expect nearly anyone to be able to work out.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.040
It's also a fair and unbiased question, of course.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.920
I mean, everyone was given the exact same question

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.960
and the exact same amount of time to answer it, right?

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.080
What could be more fair and unbiased than that?

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.320
Now, of course, this question is not fair.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.760
It is biased in favor of Japanese people.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.920
And anime fans, I guess.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.000
The point here is that this question would,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.400
in any language, be biased against people

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.640
who don't speak that language.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.960
A question in English is biased against people

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.120
who don't speak English, isn't it?

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.400
Now you might protest.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.480
This seems like a very obvious point.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.240
I mean, surely nobody is gonna give an IQ test in English

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.880
to a group of people who are not fluent in English

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:30.000
and then try to pass off those results as legitimate, right?

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.880
Well, stay tuned, folks.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.840
One point not given due consideration by the bell curve

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.000
during their discussion of testing bias

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.120
is that even a completely unbiased test,

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.760
were it possible to construct such a thing,

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.080
would still deliver biased results

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.960
if it were being carried out in a biased system.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.040
When Herrnstein and Murray say properly administered IQ tests

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.880
are not demonstrably biased,

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.360
they seemingly mean that the tests themselves

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.920
do not contain words like regatta,

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.600
not that the tests necessarily deliver fair results.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.440
So that is another potential problem with IQ tests to watch out for.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.600
Even if we eliminate as much cultural bias as possible from the test,

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.920
we could still, thanks to the wider environment

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.840
the tests are taking place in, be receiving biased results.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.400
For instance, if you carried out an IQ test

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.920
in a racially segregated white supremacist state,

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.440
that environment is obviously gonna affect the average IQ scores

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.920
of different designated racial groups.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.120
Now you might protest.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.680
This also seems like a very obvious point.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.720
I mean, surely nobody's gonna carry out an IQ test

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.680
in a racially segregated white supremacist state

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.720
and then try to pass off those results as legitimate, right?

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.840
Again, stay tuned, folks.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:48.720
Now keeping in mind all the various possible problems

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.880
with IQ testing that we've just discussed,

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.120
let's take a look at a few of the IQ tests

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:57.600
that Herrnstein and Murray cite as evidence for claims in the bell curve.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.800
Surely they will be properly administered, right?

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.960
After all, Herrnstein and Murray themselves

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.840
discuss many of the same issues that we just have.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.160
It would follow that given their familiarity

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.520
with these potential problems,

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.320
they would of course endeavor to avoid them.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.560
So let's see how they do on that front.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.160
We'll take a look at a particular section of the bell curve now,

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.360
see what the claims are,

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.960
and then have a bit of a dig into the sources backing up those claims.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.640
And this is from a section titled

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:30.000
How do African Americans compare with blacks in Africa on cognitive tests?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.120
And I quote,

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.520
This question often arises in the context of black-white comparisons in America,

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.160
the thought being that the African black population

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.720
has not been subjected to the historical legacy

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.360
of American black slavery and discrimination

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.760
and might therefore have higher scores.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.480
Richard Lynn was able to assemble 11 studies

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:51.040
in his 1991 review of the literature.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.200
He estimated the median black African IQ to be 75,

01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:00.800
approximately 1.7 standard deviations below the US overall population average,

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.880
about 10 points lower than the current figure for American blacks.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.440
In summary, African blacks are, on average,

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.280
substantially below African Americans in intelligence test scores.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.720
Psychometrically, there is little reason to think that these results

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.040
mean anything different about cognitive functioning

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.520
than they mean in non-African populations.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.240
For our purposes, the main point is that the hypothesis

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.160
about the special circumstances of American blacks depressing their test scores

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.120
is not substantiated by the African data.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.120
So this is Herrnstein and Murray's answer

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.680
to those who point to the legacy of slavery and discrimination in the United States

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.480
as an explanation for the differences in IQ scores

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.720
between its black and white populations.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.880
They point to black people in Africa and say,

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.680
hey, well, they also got lower scores.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.720
Black African people haven't been subject to discrimination in America after all,

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.400
so doesn't this prove that discrimination in America

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.480
can't be depressing black IQ scores?

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.800
Well, not really.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.760
Herrnstein and Murray's decision to limit their concern here

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.160
to American black slavery and discrimination is a huge oversight

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.080
because there could also be discrimination in whichever parts of Africa

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.160
they are talking about, if you follow.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.880
That could be, in a similar way, depressing the scores there, too.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.920
If that were the case, attempting to use the African data

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.640
as some sort of control test for the American data

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.200
would be fairly ridiculous, to say the least.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.760
America does not have a monopoly on discrimination and depression, does it?

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.080
And so we need to ask, which parts of Africa are they talking about?

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:38.000
They say that Richard Lin was able to assemble 11 studies

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.800
in his 1991 review of the literature.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.200
Now, Herrnstein and Murray claiming the acknowledgments

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.600
at the start of the bell curve to have benefited

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.400
especially from the advice of this Richard Lin,

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.720
who they elsewhere call a leading scholar of racial and ethnic differences,

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.920
and they cite his work several times throughout the book.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.480
So let's take a look at Richard Lin's 1991 review of the literature,

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.800
entitled, Race Differences in Intelligence, A Global Perspective,

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.680
which was published in Mankind Quarterly,

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.920
and remember the name of that journal, folks,

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.400
as we'll be talking more about that later on.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.640
So the first thing we'll notice about this review

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.360
is that it unfortunately designates people as either

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.640
caucasoids, mongoloids, or negroids,

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.600
including, quote, hybrids of those groups,

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.680
for instance, caucasoid, negroid, hybrids, and so on.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.120
I can only apologize for having to read out this rubbish.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.080
So let's look at the 11 studies included in this review

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.360
and see which areas of Africa we are concerned with.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:41.200
Well, there's one from what was then known as the Belgian Congo,

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.480
one from Ghana, two from Nigeria, one from Uganda,

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.400
one from Zambia, and five from South Africa.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.320
And there is rather a lot to comment on here,

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.200
but how about we start with sample sizes?

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.480
Some of them are rather small, you may have noticed.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.440
87 people for Nigeria, 50 people for Uganda, and so on.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.040
By far the most represented area here is South Africa.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.360
The number of people tested in South Africa

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.280
was more than double the number of all the other subjects combined.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.280
And what's the significance of this?

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.320
Well, this review was published in 1991.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.080
South African apartheid ended in 1994.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.800
Now, I don't want to get too deep into this right now,

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.240
but for those who don't know,

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.360
apartheid was an explicitly white supremacist system

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.680
of enforced racial segregation.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:32.960
Non-white South Africans were openly discriminated against,

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.840
forced from their homes, forbidden to live in certain areas

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:38.800
and hold certain jobs, and most importantly for us here,

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.040
had to attend segregated schools,

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.920
which were massively underfunded compared to the schools

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.160
that the white South Africans went to,

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.000
many being without electricity or even running water.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.440
And just so we know the sort of education system we're dealing with here,

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.480
I'll quickly quote some relevant passages from South Africa,

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.440
a country study from the Library of Congress.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.400
The Bantu Education Act of 1953

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.120
widened the gaps in educational opportunities

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.800
for different racial groups.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.280
Two of the architects of Bantu education,

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.960
Dr. W.M. Iselin and Dr. Hendrik F. Ferwerd,

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.920
had studied in Germany and adopted many elements

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.200
of National Socialist, Nazi, philosophy.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.320
The concept of racial purity in particular

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.560
provided a rationalization for keeping black education inferior.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.120
Ferwerd, then Minister of Native Affairs,

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.760
said that black Africans should be educated

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.160
for their opportunities in life

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.760
and that there was no place for them

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.720
above the level of certain forms of labor.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.960
The Bantu Education Act helped pave the way

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.920
for labor strife in the 1980s and 1990s

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.120
by institutionalizing a plan to restrict black workers

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.400
to low-paid jobs through deliberately inferior education.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.600
During the 1960s and 1970s,

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.360
per capita spending on white pupils

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.240
was about ten times greater than educational spending

01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.440
on black pupils.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.560
By the early 1990s, the gap had been reduced by half,

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.960
but in general, standards for teacher qualifications

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.400
and facilities in black schools

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.520
continued to be inferior to those in white schools.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.880
The discrepancies in education among racial groups were glaring.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.120
Teacher-pupil ratios in primary schools

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.360
averaged 1 to 18 in white schools,

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.280
1 to 24 in Asian schools,

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.280
1 to 27 in colored schools,

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.440
and 1 to 39 in black schools.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.200
Moreover, whereas 96% of all teachers in white schools

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.480
had teaching certificates,

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.160
only 15% of teachers in black schools were certified.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.240
Secondary school pass rates for black pupils

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.040
in the nationwide standardized high school graduation exams

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.440
were less than one-half the pass rate for whites.

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.360
You get the point, I think.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.160
So what Hernstein and Murray have done here

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.520
in attempting to prove that a history of racial discrimination

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.880
in America is not depressing black IQ scores

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.520
is point to a study citing similar scores

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.400
in a system of open racial discrimination.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.200
This is utterly ridiculous, obviously.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.760
Anyway, we're now gonna take a look at some of these studies

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.440
compiled by Richard Lin,

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.800
and we'll start with this one, Woburn 1969,

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.680
which apparently reported an IQ score of 86 from Nigeria.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.080
And here it is, the meaning and stability

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.120
of Raven's matrices test among Africans,

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.960
and let's read a little of that.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.080
This paper aims to clarify our understanding of factors

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.640
affecting African scores on ability tests,

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.800
Raven's matrices in particular.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.720
Though the main burden is theoretical,

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.280
some fresh data from Nigeria will be shown.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.320
During 1965, a testing program was carried out

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.320
among factory workers in Nigeria.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.360
The results from 86 men will be reported here.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.760
They were tested individually in English or Pidgin

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.880
by the author with the aid of a trained Nigerian assistant.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.080
Among the test battery were Raven's progressive matrices

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.560
and an adapted embedded figures test,

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.960
which with an index of educational attainment

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.560
are explained by Woburn.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.000
Six months after the tests,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.160
each man was given the matrices again.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.760
There was no intervening coaching,

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.400
and the test was given as though it was to be a new experience

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.000
with full instructions repeated

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.920
and evidently equally necessary in most cases as previously.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.160
Men were not overtly asked to pit their presence

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.840
against their previous efforts.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.080
Results were presented in table one.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.280
The relation between retested matrices and EFT

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.560
is significantly greater

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.760
than between the initial matrices testing and EFT,

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.600
even though in the former comparisons,

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:26.000
the tests were done six months apart.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.800
Table one shows that the overall differences in retesting

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.280
were significant and suggests that improvements

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.800
were found particularly among the lower initial scorers.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.000
Taken with the improved EFT correlation in table two,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.560
a strong case can be made that the second testing

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.480
gave a distinctly more valid measure

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:46.160
of whatever abilities the matrices and EFT involve.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.960
So to quickly summarize, in 1965,

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.000
researchers gave 86 Nigerian factory workers

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.840
the Raven's Progressive Matrices Test

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.160
and then gave it to them again six months later.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.600
The second time they took the test,

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.040
they performed better overall,

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.640
and the results better correlated

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.200
with another test they took called the EFT.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.680
And table one here shows both mean results,

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.400
15.9 the first time, increasing to 18.73 the second time.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.240
What is missing here, you may have noticed, is an IQ score.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.640
This study does not report an IQ score

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.400
for anyone involved in the test.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.960
It reports their scores on the matrices test.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.040
So why then does Lin's review cite Wober 1969

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.080
as having reported an IQ score of 86?

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.400
Well, looking at table one, 86 men took the test.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:33.680
Do you see?

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.160
Now, most likely here, this is a simple typographical error,

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.720
and Lin, or whoever typed up his data,

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.880
accidentally wrote the number of test subjects

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.480
in the IQ field.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.360
Regardless, though, Lin's review is not accurately

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.560
reporting the IQ score from Wober 1969

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.160
because there wasn't one.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.680
Lin cites Wober 1969 again in his later book,

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.080
IQ and the Wealth of Nations,

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.600
where he says in 1965, norms for the standard

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:04.960
progressive matrices were collected by Wober 1969

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:07.280
for a sample of 86 adult men.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.760
Their mean score was 15.9.

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.600
And then he later claims that this equates

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.680
to an IQ of 64.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.240
Now, there are several lies by omission here.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.120
Firstly, Wober 1969 did not report a mean score of 15.9.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.680
It reported a mean score of 15.9

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.120
and a mean score of 18.73.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.920
It showed how scores go up with retesting.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.080
And additionally, it claims that a strong case

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.000
can be made that the second testing

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.840
gave a distinctly more valid measure

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.040
of whatever abilities the matrices and EFT involve.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.680
Lin intentionally chooses to only report

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.200
the lower score here.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.840
Another lie by omission here is that Lin declines

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.720
to mention that the sample of 86 adult men

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:52.400
were not randomly drawn from the general Nigerian population.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.720
They were not an accurate representation

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.240
of the society where they lived,

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.320
and nor were they intended to be.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.560
They were all factory workers.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.760
Reporting the test results of only 86 men

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.080
who are all employed in the same job

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.840
as representative of a country,

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.280
which at the time had a population of 50 million people,

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.880
is... rubbish.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.040
Just rubbish.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.680
Next up, let's talk about this result,

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.440
an IQ of 75 for people in Zambia,

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:27.360
cited from Pons 1974 and Crawford Nutt 1976.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.280
So the 1976 paper from Crawford Nutt is titled

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.480
Are Black Scores on Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.960
an Artifact of Test Presentation?

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.080
And opens by saying that previous research has shown that

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.400
when the method of test presentation ensures

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.200
that testees understand adequately the requirements

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.880
of the test situation,

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.520
when the method also makes certain that the testees know

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.640
how items of the test are to be responded to,

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.600
and when the method reduces the anxiety of the subjects

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.120
about being tested,

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.160
then the results obtained from the administration of the test

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.560
are remarkably different from those that result

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.280
from administration in which the same test is presented

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.200
in the same way to all testees,

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.440
regardless of their cultural origin.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.480
It goes on to detail how a researcher named Pons

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.200
gave the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.800
to a group of Zambian copper miners in 1962,

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.040
using the standard method of delivery.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:25.040
Then later, Pons administered the test again to another group,

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.800
only this time using a different method of test presentation.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.240
As table one shows,

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:34.000
the second group showed a rather dramatic difference in score.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.080
Now, the thinking behind all this might be

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.400
that a group of Zambian copper miners

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.800
aren't necessarily going to be all that familiar

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.680
with taking academic tests, not to generalize,

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.600
and if you want more accurate results,

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.880
it might be worth taking the time to actually explain to them

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.120
what it is that they're being expected to do.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.960
Now, Crawford Knott claims

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.720
that the different method of presentation

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.040
did not alter anything about the test itself

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.240
and is based upon suggestions found in the 1960 guide

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:04.160
to the standard progressive matrices written by John C. Raven,

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.640
AKA the guy what invented the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.880
After reporting the findings of Pons,

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.360
Crawford Knott takes things one step further

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:17.200
and tests a selection of pupils from a long-established high school

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.080
situated in the black residential area of Soweto near Johannesburg,

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.720
a school that is described as having high standards

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.680
and whose students would be used to being tested.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.640
Crawford Knott tested two samples of these schoolchildren

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.680
using the same presentation method as described by Pons,

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:36.400
and the results received were actually slightly higher

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.280
than the equivalent age range of the white group

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.600
on whom the test was normalized.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.680
Now, you might say, what has Crawford Knott actually proved there?

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:50.320
Test results go up the closer you get to a good school, I suppose.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.640
This shouldn't be surprising anyone.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:56.080
If you test a relatively uneducated group of copper miners,

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.440
you get one result.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.800
Do that same test in a competitive academic institution

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.720
and you will get a higher result.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.960
By changing the method of test presentation

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.520
and changing the group which you are testing,

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.600
you can get a whole range of results.

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:12.320
This is why researchers don't usually test people

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:15.600
in just one area, one workplace, or one school

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.080
and then try to pass off that singular result

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.600
as representative of the entire country that they live in.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.560
That would be a remarkably ignorant thing to do.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:30.240
Speaking of, back to Richard Lin and his claimed IQ of 75 for Zambia,

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.800
which cites both Pons and Crawford Knott

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.480
as the source of the data there.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.240
So how did that happen?

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:39.760
Well, what Lin does is, he cites the much lower results

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.760
from the research carried out by Pons,

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:44.720
which are presented in Crawford Knott's paper,

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:48.240
and then completely ignores Crawford Knott's experiment in the school,

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.960
which reported results above the white norm.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.840
The entire point of Crawford Knott's paper goes totally unmentioned by Lin,

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.240
who simply extracts the data that he wants and discards the rest.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.360
He had data showing a black African test score

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.120
that was above the white norm,

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.000
and he simply decided to ignore it.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.320
Also, like the previous paper we discussed,

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.560
this study did not report IQ scores for the testees.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.400
Those are simply concocted by Lin

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.880
out of the Raven's progressive matrices data,

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:23.120
using a sophisticated statistical technique called guessing.

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.960
So to understand what Lin has done here,

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.200
we need to talk a little about IQ test construction and standardization.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.200
And let's start with the bell curve.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.520
Not the book this time, but the statistical distribution.

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:41.040
Now, IQ tests, as we know, return this bell curve, or normal distribution.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:44.800
This means that the majority of the scores are clustered around the middle

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:48.560
and taper off towards the ends of the curve in a symmetrical way.

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.280
But why, you might ask, do they actually return this distribution?

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.520
Well, it's because that's how they're designed.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:00.800
Psychometricians design IQ tests so that their results match the bell curve.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.040
If the test they design is too easy,

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.880
then the bell curve will lean to the right,

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.120
as too many people will get high scores.

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.240
If the test is too hard, it will lean to the left,

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.480
as too many people get low scores.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.400
And if the test doesn't differentiate between people to the right degree,

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.840
then too many people could be at either end of the curve.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.520
So the test designers tinker with the difficulty of the test

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.840
until the results match the bell curve.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.960
So why do psychometricians do this?

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.240
Well, it's because that's how they assume intelligence is distributed

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.000
throughout the human population.

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.880
Emphasis on assume here,

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.400
because we do not actually know how intelligence is distributed

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.160
throughout the human population.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.800
Unless you specifically design for it,

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.720
tests do not necessarily return a bell curve distribution.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:49.840
For example here,

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:53.280
the armed forces qualifying test used in the bell curve

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.840
did not return a bell curve distribution.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:01.200
It was, after all, designed to test readiness to join the armed forces, not IQ.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.040
As a result, it does not differentiate between people to a large enough degree,

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.120
so Hernstein and Murray, to make the results conform to a bell curve,

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.280
recalculated the scores.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:16.080
Here is a graph of the raw AFQT scores overlaid with Hernstein and Murray's

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:20.400
recalculated bell curve scores from the book Inequality by Design.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.920
And as we can see, too many people scored too highly on the test

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.400
and there isn't enough differentiation between people

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.800
on the upper end of the scale in particular.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.160
So yes, that's right.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.840
In the book The Bell Curve,

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.120
the principal intelligence test the authors use as a source

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.600
did not return a bell curve distribution.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.240
To transform these results into a bell curve,

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.800
Hernstein and Murray exaggerated the slight differences at the end of the scale.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.880
They basically gave extra credit for being near the tails of the bell curve

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.120
and less for being in the middle.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.600
They did this as they explain in Appendix 2 to correct for skew.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.880
But remember, in relation to how intelligence is distributed

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.720
throughout the human population,

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.120
these results are only actually skewed

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.760
if we assume that intelligence is distributed in a bell curve to begin with.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.520
This is circular logic.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.880
We are assuming the result that we are going to get beforehand

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.480
and then designing the test or just manipulating the data

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.560
in order to reach that conclusion.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.400
Anyway, to get back on track here,

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:25.120
what does all this have to do with Richard Lin and the Raven's progressive matrices test?

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:29.280
Well, that test also does not return a bell curve distribution.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.640
The results are not symmetrically distributed around their mean,

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.600
to quote an article by psychologist Leon Kamin.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.200
That article also notes that the test's developer, John Raven,

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.480
always insisted that the progressive matrices scores cannot be converted into IQs.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.760
Here is an example of the distribution of matrix test scores

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:52.240
from Raven's paper, Standardization of Progressive Matrices 1938.

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.240
And as you can see, those are some very wobbly bell curves right there.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.120
What the test does give is raw scores which correspond to percentile scores.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.120
So you can know from your raw score how you compare percentile-wise

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.680
to the group on which the test was normalized.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:13.040
But these percentiles will not be distributed evenly around their mean in a bell curve.

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.680
To calculate IQ, Richard Lin takes the average of these raw scores,

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.000
converts them to a percentile score,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.720
and then gives what the IQ of that percentile score would correspond to

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:28.240
if the results were in a bell curve distribution.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.560
Basically, Lin is assuming a bell curve exists where there demonstrably isn't one

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.800
and is forcing the data to fit it.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.480
Another issue here is that in the decades since the Second World War,

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:43.760
scores on the Raven's matrices test similar to IQ test scores had been changing.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.200
Accordingly, the test had been standardized several times.

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.200
So when we're comparing the African results with Western norms,

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.080
we need to identify what norm group we're using

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.280
because comparisons with different groups from different times could give different results.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:04.000
Particularly sharp-eyed viewers would have noticed that Lin does exactly this

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.320
in the quote from his 2002 book,

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.200
IQ and the Wealth of Nations, which I showed earlier,

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.160
where he discusses Nigerian IQs, quote,

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:16.000
in terms of the British 1979 standardization.

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.600
Identifying this standardization is important,

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:25.040
as using a different one could lead to a different Nigerian IQ being calculated.

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.520
In his 1991 review of the literature cited in the bell curve, however,

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:35.440
Lin does not identify what standardization he's using for the various tests he is comparing.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:38.640
What this means is that there is a gap in Lin's calculations

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.480
that can only be filled by faith in his academic honesty,

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.720
which Hearnstein and Murray clearly have,

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.520
but I must confess that I do not.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.040
Anyway, if you think what Lin did to those last two studies was bad,

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.240
strap in, because this next one is a real bastard.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:59.600
South Africa IQ of 69, attributed to Owen, 1989,

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.240
which Lin calls the single best study of the Negroid Intelligence.

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.520
So this is test and item bias,

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:11.520
the suitability of the junior aptitude tests as a common test battery

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.560
for white, Indian, and black pupils in standard 7.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.600
Owen is not one for catchy names, apparently.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.000
The abstract to this study starts out,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.560
This study was undertaken to shed light on problems

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.360
concerning the construction and use of a common test battery

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.920
for various South African population groups.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.480
You see, this study is testing a test,

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.600
the Junior Aptitude Test, or JAT,

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.880
which was standardized for white pupils in South Africa

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.800
and determining whether it's also a good test to give to non-white groups.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:46.000
The study selected various schools in South Africa for white, Indian, and black students.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.120
Although it should be mentioned,

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:50.480
it was not able to use the majority of the selected black schools,

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:50.960
quote,

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:56.640
and thus they had to test black schools in the KwaZulu region,

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:01.840
one of the areas designated for black inhabitants of South Africa under apartheid.

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:04.800
I mention the unrest situation here as a reminder that,

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.840
yes, these tests are being carried out under apartheid,

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:13.040
and protests and demonstrations against the segregated school system were ongoing.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.600
So anyway, the study examined pupils' performances

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:18.640
on the various sub-tests comprising the JAT,

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.160
and what were the findings?

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.160
Well, the thing I think we should mention first here

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:26.480
is that the tests were given to the black students in KwaZulu in English only,

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:31.600
and several test sections of the JAT relied very heavily upon language ability.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:35.120
Now, Owen expected language ability not to matter in the tests

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.760
because the black students in the KwaZulu region

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:41.120
had ostensibly been learning English in their schools.

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.760
Owen apparently either doesn't know or disregards

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.120
that these schools often didn't have necessary teaching equipment,

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:49.760
only a small amount of their teachers were certified,

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:53.440
and that pupil-teacher ratios were more than double that of the white schools.

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.720
And to quote the study,

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:59.920
language was not expected to play a significant role in test performance in this investigation.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:03.760
However, the results showed that this assumption was completely wrong.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.480
In fact, language played such an important role,

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:10.080
and the knowledge of English of the majority of black testees was so poor

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:13.760
that certain tests, for example the JAT-4 synonyms

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:18.640
and the JAT-8 memory paragraph, proved to be virtually unusable.

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.200
And let me just quote that again.

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.960
Certain tests proved to be virtually unusable.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.800
Owen also writes elsewhere,

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:31.520
the results of the current investigation clearly show that language played a prominent role

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.160
in all the tests containing language items,

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:38.640
which is a wonderful multiple stab wounds shown to shorten life expectancy,

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:41.280
bit of academic obviousness there.

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:46.400
Language ability was not the only way in which the Junior Aptitude Test was biased, however.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.840
In a section entitled Item Bias in the Tests of the JAT,

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:54.880
Owen notes several ways in which the tests were culturally and economically biased.

01:31:54.880 --> 01:32:00.320
For example, he here lists several test items on the first test in the JAT and states,

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:04.560
A common element in most of these items was that they presuppose knowledge

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:07.440
or a degree of knowledge on the part of the testee,

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.480
and mentions such things as electrical appliances,

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:14.400
microscopes, and Western types of ladies' accessories.

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.680
Going on to write,

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:18.560
Thus in the case of both the Indian and Black testees,

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.400
it seems that the single largest cause of bias lay in the fact that the pupils

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:26.240
were not familiar with the objects represented by the pictures.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:31.440
Cultural and socioeconomic status factors probably also played a role in this regard.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.600
So this test is biased, then.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:36.800
The study examining it says it is biased,

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.480
but according to Richard Lin,

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:42.960
this is the single best study of the Negroid Intelligence.

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.480
This is the best one.

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:48.800
The one that tests segregated school children in a non-native language

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.760
and calls its own results virtually unusable.

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:52.800
In Lin's review,

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:56.720
this is the most important study for his estimates of Black African IQ.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.800
Writing about it, he says,

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:04.320
The mean IQ of the sample in comparison with Caucasoid South African norms is 69.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:08.160
It is also around the median of the studies listed in Table 3.

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:11.360
It is proposed, therefore, to round this figure up to 70.

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.120
Why?

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:17.280
And take this as the approximate mean for pure Negroids.

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.320
God damn.

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.800
What Lin has done here is ridiculous.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:26.560
He has taken 11 studies from a period between 1929 and 1991,

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:31.360
with vastly different sample sizes reporting data from different tests,

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:34.480
most of which didn't even report IQ scores,

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:39.040
transformed the data into what he reckons the equivalent IQ scores were

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.600
using some unknown standardization,

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.240
picked one that was sort of near the middle,

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:46.960
and said that's the average Black African IQ.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.920
This is outrageous.

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.440
It is a crime.

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.720
It might actually be a crime, and if it's not, it should be.

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:57.600
Now, I am far from the first person to criticize

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.480
the Bell Curve's reliance upon Richard Lin as a source.

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:04.960
Various academics were already well aware of Lin and his dodgy data,

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.040
so when Herrnstein and Murray cited him,

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.840
they were immediately attacked with accusations of bias and racism.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.840
Charles Murray responds to these attacks in the afterword to the Bell Curve,

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.520
and his defense is laughable.

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:20.800
His first defense is to say that the topic of African IQ

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:26.080
is a tiny piece of the Bell Curve, three paragraphs on pages 288 to 89,

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.520
and in regards to this, two responses jump to mind immediately.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:34.160
The first is to say, well, maybe you should have spent longer on it then, Charles.

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.000
We were wrong very quickly.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.640
Isn't a defense against being wrong, is it?

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.400
Maybe if you put a little more effort in,

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.520
you would have seen that Lin's paper was a load of rubbish.

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:48.160
Secondly, this part of the Bell Curve is far more important than Murray makes out.

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.200
He uses Lin's paper to dismiss the arguments

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.360
that black-white differences in IQ are caused by environmental factors,

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.120
such as a history of oppression,

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.920
which is the single most common counterargument

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.880
to one of the principal claims in the entire book.

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.440
At no point does Murray actually address any specific criticisms of Lin's work

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.520
or any of its various errors.

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.560
He mainly just seems outraged that anyone dares to have criticized him at all, to be honest.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.280
And it's exactly this sort of academic laziness

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:20.480
that fed much of the angry response to the Bell Curve.

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:23.600
Murray refuses to admit that citing Lin was a mistake,

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.720
and simply throws out some newer studies that supposedly show he was right anyway.

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:29.760
So there.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.000
This speaks to a couple of things.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.320
Firstly, it is a fatal underestimation of exactly how badly this damages

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.000
the faith that a reader of the Bell Curve can have in its authors.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.120
After all, this is not the only time they cite Richard Lin.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:46.240
He has more than 20 citations in their bibliography,

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.040
and they thank him specifically in the acknowledgments.

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.520
If this is the sort of data that Charles Murray is willing to accept as legitimate,

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:56.800
how can we trust anything he says anywhere in the book?

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.320
How can we trust the new studies he brings up to defend Richard Lin?

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.920
Personally, I think it would be a mistake to even look at these new studies.

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:09.360
Murray's response to having his previous sources called into question

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.760
is to simply throw out new sources.

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.400
His response to having these called into question would no doubt be to throw out more.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.560
The responsibility for checking whether his sources are trustworthy or accurate

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:23.760
has been moved from Murray to his critics.

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:26.160
They're the ones doing the reading and the fact-checking,

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.800
whereas he never gets held to account.

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:34.000
So long as we all understand that, however, I suppose we can take a brief peek.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.200
So, Murray says,

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.880
Let me turn to two studies post-dating Richard Lin's review that we cite on page 289.

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:43.600
One was a South African study led by Kenneth Owen,

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:48.320
published in the refereed British journal Personality and Individual Differences.

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.320
So this was the suitability of Raven's standard progressive matrices

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.480
for various groups in South Africa,

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.080
a paper that was published in 1992.

01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:01.280
So we are still in apartheid South Africa.

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:04.960
And this study tested black students from the KwaZulu region,

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.080
the same as one of the studies from Richard Lin's review.

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.080
It even has the same author.

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:13.680
So this is not a great showing with the first study here.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.080
Murray introduces the other study by saying,

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.480
The second example of a recent careful study

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:22.800
was conducted by a black scholar, Fred Cindy, and published in The Psychologist.

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.920
It matched 204 black Zimbabwean pupils

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:29.600
and 202 white English students from London inner-city schools

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.240
for age, 12 to 14 years old, sex, and educational level,

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.200
both samples being characterized as working class,

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.920
and then goes on to say that the white students from London

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.240
got higher test results than the black students from Zimbabwe.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.800
However, Murray takes the cue from Richard Lin and leaves out all the context.

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:53.440
The main thing here being that Zimbabwe was a British colony known as Rhodesia

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:58.720
until it gained independence in 1980, following a 15-year civil war.

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:03.280
Rhodesia was a discriminatory racially segregated state.

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:09.360
12 to 14-year-olds in 1994 would have been born around the time of Zimbabwe's independence

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.080
to parents who were raised and educated in a segregated British colony.

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.560
Which makes the comparison to the children of London as all the more ridiculous here.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.680
The children of the colonized country are being measured

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:24.480
against the children of the colonizing country.

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:27.040
Fred Cindy, the professor who offered the study,

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:30.080
more recently spoke about his earlier work in the following way.

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.760
For many years, African countries have depended upon the use

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.080
of Western-designed psychometric instruments

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.920
such as Raven's progressive matrices and some others.

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.720
Such tests, standardized in Western cultures using Western cultural values,

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.600
have been found to be useful to a certain extent.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.760
In many cases, interpretation of results from Western-designed tests

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:57.120
have however been distorted to suit Western stereotypes about other nations.

01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.120
Cindy 1994.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:03.680
A very important point which Lin and Murray would do well to take on board.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:08.560
Murray reveals a misunderstanding of the criticisms raised against the bell curve

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.000
when he goes on to say that the problem is not as often alleged

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.880
that such studies are written by racists.

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.640
In the two instances just cited,

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:21.040
a charge belied by Owen's scholarly reputation and by Cindy's race,

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.000
but that the African story is still so incomplete.

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:26.240
What Murray gets wrong here,

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.200
beyond the implication that a scholarly reputation

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:32.000
could not also be accompanied by racism,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.160
is that the allegation is not that these studies are written by racists.

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.280
It's that the studies are being deliberately misinterpreted

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:42.080
and misrepresented by racists.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.000
Racists like Richard Lin,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.960
who stripped from the studies all context and analysis

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:49.840
and used them to push a racist worldview.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:53.520
Murray fails to see that the problem is not that it is impossible

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:58.000
to find other studies that have similar results to the ones cited in the bell curve.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.200
It's that he's willing to treat data collected in a segregated white supremacist state

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:08.000
as a legitimate source to inform us about inherent racial differences.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.840
That is the issue here.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.120
On a more general note,

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:14.240
what Murray writes in the afterword and how he writes it

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.880
shows us exactly how little respect he has

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:19.680
for what should be treated as a sensitive topic.

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.120
The subject of his writing is potential differences

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.920
in native ability between racial groups,

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.360
and discussing that requires a level of tact and consideration

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.680
that is totally absent here.

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.120
You cannot half-ass the science with this stuff.

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.920
Murray's refusal to respond directly to criticism of his sources here

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.160
exposes him as a fraud.

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:45.920
We're going to move on now and consider how the bell curve measures intelligence

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.920
against socioeconomic status in determining one's life outcomes.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.560
But I'd like you to keep in mind, if possible,

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.040
several of the things we've talked about so far.

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.680
The difficulty in defining intelligence.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.480
The difficulties in testing for intelligence.

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:04.160
The bell curve's missing genetic evidence for IQ.

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.880
And of course, the incredibly shoddy sources

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:10.560
that Hernstein and Murray are apparently willing to accept.

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:14.000
When we see a graph measuring intelligence against environment,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.880
we should not be fooled into thinking that that intelligence

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.160
was legitimately or accurately calculated.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.440
Anyway, to the claim.

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.280
One's IQ is more important than one's social background

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:27.280
in determining one's life outcomes.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.600
To address this claim, we first need to define the terms.

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:34.480
We know by now how Hernstein and Murray have been determining

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.720
the IQ of the people they're examining

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:40.240
by using their scores on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test.

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:43.360
But in order to make comparisons to their IQ,

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.840
how is the bell curve determining those people's socioeconomic status?

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:53.920
Let's take as an example poverty from Chapter 5 of the bell curve titled Poverty.

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:56.800
Hernstein and Murray want to compare low intelligence

01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:00.480
with low socioeconomic status as causes for poverty

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:03.040
to figure out which is more important.

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.240
They use the survey respondents' AFQT scores as their data for intelligence,

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.760
and they use socioeconomic information provided by the respondents

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:15.840
to build what they call an index of socioeconomic status.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.360
Both of these are then compared with the likelihood of the respondents

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.760
being below the poverty line a decade later.

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.560
And of course, Hernstein and Murray find that intelligence

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:26.960
is the better predictor of poverty.

01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.240
So I guess we'd better examine exactly how Hernstein and Murray

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:33.520
constructed their index of socioeconomic status.

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:38.160
But before we get to that, I'd like to propose a question for us to answer.

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.960
What environmental factors would you deem important

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:44.880
with regards to the likelihood of a young person being in poverty?

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.760
And let's discuss a few possibilities here.

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.480
First up, parental socioeconomic status,

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.360
which is usually defined as their level of education, occupation, and income.

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.000
I think we'd all agree that is fairly important.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.680
Families that have a larger income are less likely to be in poverty.

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:04.640
Better educated parents are more likely to have better jobs

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:07.200
and therefore less likely to have children in poverty.

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:08.960
This is rather straightforward.

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:11.280
Family composition is important.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.840
A family with a particular income and living space

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:16.720
stretched to take care of six children, say,

01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:20.160
is gonna have a harder time than a family with the same income and living space

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.480
but only one child to take care of.

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.960
So number of siblings is important,

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.200
as is whether or not the individual was raised in a two-parent family.

01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:31.680
Two parents typically means more resources

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.080
and therefore less chance of being in poverty.

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.960
The area where someone lives is very important.

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.960
One family with a particular income might have a very different living experience

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:45.120
to another family with the same income that lives in a different area.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.520
And this could be for a variety of reasons.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:52.640
Average living expenses like rent, food, and other costs that vary from place to place,

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.760
the average crime rate, the unemployment rate,

01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:59.600
that can be very important for determining one's chance of being in poverty.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.200
Seems fairly obvious to mention,

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.920
but you're gonna have an easier time finding an income

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.680
in an area with many jobs than an area with few jobs.

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.680
Another reason the area someone lives is important to us here is school quality,

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.600
which should be particularly noteworthy,

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.040
given that we're measuring all of this against performance on an academic test.

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.400
How long someone stays in school is also important,

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:22.800
and how many years of education they completed

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.480
both before and after taking the armed forces qualifying test.

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.640
Familial wealth is important, and this is a separate issue to income.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.400
One person with a particular income,

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:36.720
whose rich parents bought them a house and a car and paid their way through college,

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:40.160
is gonna have a different experience to a person on the same income,

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.440
but who has to pay off debt related to all of those things.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.120
Overall, economic trends can be very important.

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:50.560
You are more likely to be in poverty during a recession.

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:53.520
The reason that the poverty rate increases during recessions

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:57.440
is not because everyone collectively loses a few IQ points, is it?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000
And the effects of recession are felt unequally across economic classes

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.920
and different geographical areas.

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:06.560
One's gender is important.

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.000
Women, for example, are more likely to be in poverty than men are.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.880
Now, whether you believe this is because women have lower genetic IQs than men do,

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.640
or you're sensible and you believe it's because of environmental reasons,

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:19.840
it is the case.

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:22.160
I should note here that I'm excluding race

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.560
because this chapter of the bell curve concerns itself

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.680
with only the white respondents to the AFQT.

01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:30.160
Your health is important, of course.

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.760
People with disabilities, for instance, are more likely to be in poverty,

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:37.600
and particularly in the US, the cost of medical care and health insurance

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.040
can massively affect someone's likelihood of being in poverty.

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:44.640
And we could go on listing things, but we will arbitrarily stop here.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.720
I trust you get the point by now.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:49.040
There are lots of different things to consider

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:52.000
when attempting to determine how someone's environment

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.480
might contribute to them being in poverty.

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:56.880
Which brings us back to the bell curve.

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.040
Which of the various factors on this list

01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.280
did Hernstein and Murray think were important

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.360
with regards to the likelihood of a young person being in poverty?

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.280
The first one.

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:09.120
Yep, that's all.

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:12.720
Hernstein and Murray's consideration of environmental factors

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:15.920
extends to parental education, income, and occupation.

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.880
That's all.

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.160
As far as they're concerned,

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.960
with regards to the determining predictors of poverty,

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.280
all the other things on this list have no effect.

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.040
Your family's wealth has no effect.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.360
Family composition, the area where you live,

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:31.760
the quality of the school you went to, the crime rate, all irrelevant.

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:35.520
What they have done here is substitute environmental factors

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.240
for parental socioeconomic status,

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:41.680
which is a much narrower category of variables.

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:45.360
They simply add together parental education, income, and occupation,

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:49.760
call that parental socioeconomic status, and plot it against IQ.

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:51.680
And this is the graph they come up with.

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:54.800
The comparative roles of IQ and parental SES

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.560
in determining whether young white adults are below the poverty line.

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:01.840
It shows that people with low IQs are more likely to be in poverty

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.400
than people whose parents had a low SES.

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.760
And also the reverse.

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.400
High IQ people are less likely to be in poverty

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.200
than people whose parents had a high SES.

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:13.520
Cognitive ability is more important

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:17.760
than parental socioeconomic status in determining poverty, they say.

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.520
But of course, as we have seen,

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:23.840
their consideration of environmental factors here is laughably narrow.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.640
They only want to consider as valid things

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.840
that fall under their definition of parental SES.

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:33.040
And they ignore all the other relevant environmental factors.

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:37.680
What would happen to this graph if we also considered the various other things

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.880
that Hernstein and Murray leave out of their analysis?

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.640
Now, I don't know how to do regression analysis, unfortunately,

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:47.840
but the book Inequality by Design was written by some people

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:50.000
who do know how to do regression analysis,

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.880
and they do exactly what we're looking for here.

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:57.600
Firstly, they recreate Hernstein and Murray's calculations using their data.

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.040
They then use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Responses

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.880
to add more environmental data to the analysis.

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:10.080
Their first updated graph changes parental SES to parental home environment,

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.880
adding for consideration things like the number of siblings

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:15.360
and whether the household has two parents.

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:20.800
As we can see, AFQT score is still more important than parental home environment,

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:23.680
but now the two are much closer together.

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.280
Next up, they add community environment to home environment,

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:30.720
considering the region where the respondent lived when they took the test

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.640
and the school that they attended.

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:37.280
Doing this, we see that AFQT score and social environment are now equal.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.840
Next, they add for consideration the number of years of education

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:44.000
of the respondents to the survey.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.480
And by now, the AFQT score has slipped

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:49.840
below the combined environmental factors in importance.

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.000
Using the same statistical methods and data set as the bell curve,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.760
Inequality by Design's analysis shows that environmental factors

01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:00.480
are more important than AFQT score

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:03.440
in determining the probability of being in poverty.

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:06.800
And this is shown using only the limited data available

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:09.840
in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, remember.

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.120
Inequality by Design adds to the analysis only a few

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:18.160
of the conceivable socioeconomic factors that are ignored by Hernstein and Murray.

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:21.920
If we were to continue adding in available factors to consider,

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.120
the effect of IQ would get weaker and weaker.

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:28.960
And lest you think Inequality by Design's analysis was a one-off,

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:34.240
the authors of Intelligence, Genes, and Success also reanalyzed the NLSY data,

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.640
and with regards to how much cognitive ability

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:40.800
accounts for differences in wages between people, say the following.

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:44.640
However, our results conflict with the predictions of Hernstein and Murray.

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.240
Ability factors other than G are economically useful.

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.920
Compared with education, family background, and region of residence,

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:54.880
G explains little of the variance in wages.

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:58.800
If there exists some X factor that can explain the large residuals

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.040
common in wage regressions, it is not measured cognitive ability.

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:08.000
In summary, our re-analyses of the NLSY data originally analyzed by Hernstein and Murray

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.440
show measured cognitive ability is correlated with wages,

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.080
but explains little of the variance in wages across individuals and time.

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:21.280
Later in this chapter, Hernstein and Murray use this same narrowly defined parental SES

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.520
to consider which young people will drop out of school, get a college degree,

01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.920
be unemployed, have children out of wedlock, be on welfare, and so on.

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.360
To be fair, sometimes they do add other factors to consider,

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:39.360
but again, only when they personally, subjectively, decide those factors are important.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:44.160
All their comparisons between IQ and SES that inform their later policy proposals

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.440
are based upon this calculated decision to not consider

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:50.400
the full range of relevant environmental factors.

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:54.480
And there's two other important points that we have to keep in mind here.

01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:58.160
The first is that we have been assuming that AFQT score

01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.960
is a legitimate stand-in for cognitive ability,

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:05.520
which, given all the potential problems with intelligence testing we've already discussed,

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:07.120
is a bit of a stretch.

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:11.680
The second thing we need to remember is that Hernstein and Murray's estimation of IQ

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:15.600
is that it is only 60% genetically heritable.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:19.680
That would mean, according to their flawed understanding of heritability anyway,

01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:26.720
that 40% of the IQ score in their calculations originated from environmental factors.

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:32.320
Considering all these things together, the case for IQ here is looking incredibly flimsy.

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:37.600
So as we've seen, once you add more factors to consider, environment trumps IQ.

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:43.200
So we now have to ask, is this a legitimate thing to do, statistically speaking?

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:46.720
The bell curve anticipates being criticized in this manner.

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.880
In a section titled, But What About Other Explanations?, they write,

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:55.680
We can already hear critics saying, if only they'd added this other variable to the analysis,

01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:58.560
they would have seen that intelligence has nothing to do with x.

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:03.440
At this point, however, statistical analysis can become a bottomless pit.

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:07.840
It is not uncommon in technical journals to read articles built around the estimated effects

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:10.560
of a dozen or more independent variables.

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:15.280
Sometimes the entire set of variables is loaded into a single regression equation.

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:19.760
Sometimes sets of equations are used, modeling even more complex relationships

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:23.600
in which all the variables can exert mutual effects on one another.

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.280
Why should we not press forward?

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:30.480
Why not also ask if religious background has an effect on the decision to go on welfare, for example?

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:34.880
It's an interesting question, as are 50 others that might come to mind.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:37.680
This is the first of two defenses by Hanstein and Murray,

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:41.920
where they argue that it would just be too complicated to consider all the factors.

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:48.000
Why there could be 50 environmental variables affecting someone's likelihood of being in poverty,

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.600
that's just too many.

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.200
It would be too complex.

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.000
Our graph wouldn't make any sense if we did that.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:58.080
So instead of 50, we're just gonna consider, I don't know, two.

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:01.200
This is a result of treating the method of investigation

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.480
as more important than getting accurate results.

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:08.240
If you can't use regression analysis to fairly compare IQ

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:11.760
to all the relevant environmental factors, don't.

01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:14.880
You know, you don't actually have to do this.

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:19.440
Hanstein and Murray's second defense is even more telling than the first.

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:22.800
Our principle was to explore additional dynamics

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:26.480
when there was another factor that was not only conceivably important,

01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:29.440
but for clear logical reasons might be important

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:32.800
because of dynamics having little or nothing to do with IQ.

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:35.440
This last proviso is crucial,

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:38.560
for one of the most common misuses of regression analysis

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:40.800
is to introduce an additional variable

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:46.800
that in reality is mostly another expression of variables that are already in the equation.

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:50.320
So what Hanstein and Murray are saying is that they dismissed variables

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.480
if they deemed them to merely be mostly expressions of IQ,

01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:56.640
which is already in the equation.

01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.440
They only considered additional factors

01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.760
when they had little or nothing to do with IQ

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:04.560
and were, quote, conceivably important.

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.480
Which should lead us to ask a question.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:11.520
How are Hanstein and Murray deciding which variables are conceivably important?

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.880
And how are they deciding how much they have to do with IQ?

01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:18.000
And the answer, of course, is subjectively.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.240
They're only considering things that they reckon are important.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:25.440
You see, the problem with Hanstein and Murray dismissing variables

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:30.400
that they have subjectively decided are merely expressions of cognitive ability here

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:36.000
is that they think that socioeconomic status itself is an expression of cognitive ability.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:41.200
Later in the book, when criticizing the practice of controlling for SES between racial groups,

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:41.920
they write,

01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:47.040
the difficulty comes in interpreting what it means to control for socioeconomic status.

01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:50.320
Matching the status of the groups is usually justified on the grounds

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:55.440
that the scores people earn are caused to some extent by their socioeconomic status.

01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:59.360
So if we want to see the real or authentic difference between them,

01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.240
the contribution of status must be excluded.

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:07.600
The trouble is that socioeconomic status is also a result of cognitive ability,

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.680
as people of high and low cognitive ability

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:13.760
move to correspondingly high and low places in the socioeconomic continuum.

01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:16.000
Now, this is circular logic.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.840
Hanstein and Murray claim to be limiting which factors they're considering

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:24.240
to avoid including those which are merely expressions of other factors,

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:29.600
but their main comparison here is between cognitive ability and socioeconomic status,

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:33.760
which they elsewhere argue is a result of cognitive ability.

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:40.000
Using this framework, where cognitive ability determines both IQ and socioeconomic status,

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.120
the whole series of comparisons from this chapter of the bell curve

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:45.440
seems cynical and unnecessary.

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:50.000
Hanstein and Murray have already decided what conclusion they're gonna come to,

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.080
that cognitive ability is more important than all the other variables,

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:58.240
and all their statistical comparisons read as them just going through the motions

01:55:58.240 --> 01:55:59.680
to get that result.

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:04.880
In simply declaring socioeconomic status the result of cognitive ability,

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.720
the bell curve brings to mind the chicken and egg problem here.

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:11.440
You see, a lot of disagreements over IQ

01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:14.960
stem from different interpretations of the same data.

01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.320
Let's say you do a study which proves a strong positive correlation

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:22.720
between the amount of time someone has spent in education and their IQ,

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:25.840
and you present those findings to two groups of people.

01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:28.720
One group that favors environmental explanations

01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:31.600
and one that favors genetic explanations.

01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:34.720
Now, of course, the environmentalists will say,

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:36.960
this result makes perfect sense.

01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.840
The longer you're in education, the more things you learn,

01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:43.920
the better you get at answering the sorts of questions that show up on IQ tests,

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:48.080
the more familiar you are with taking academic tests in the first place.

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:51.200
IQ clearly stems from environment.

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:54.240
The genetic-minded folks, on the other hand, will say,

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:57.280
of course, this result makes perfect sense.

01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:00.480
People with higher IQs favor an academic environment,

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.800
and they're more likely to stay in school longer

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:05.200
because that's the smarter thing to do.

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.680
Since they have higher IQs to begin with,

01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:09.920
they will naturally make better choices.

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:13.280
Environment clearly stems from IQ.

01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:16.560
So which came first, the chicken or the egg?

01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:18.800
Environment or cognitive ability?

01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.800
We can phrase this two ways.

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:24.320
A parent's higher cognitive ability leads to a better environment,

01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:28.080
which again leads to a higher cognitive ability in their children.

01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:30.240
Or we can say that a better environment

01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:32.560
leads to a parent's higher cognitive ability,

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:35.920
which then produces a better environment for their children.

01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:38.720
But both of these ways of phrasing are merely presenting

01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:43.600
a segment of the overall environment-cognitive ability logic chain.

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.160
The bell curve solves the conundrum of whether

01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:49.360
cognitive ability or environment should come first by saying...

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:51.200
cognitive ability.

01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:52.720
That's first.

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:56.080
We like that one the most, so that's the one that comes first.

01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.480
But of course, this is completely arbitrary,

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:01.440
and also, ultimately, incorrect.

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:05.120
To understand this, we need to talk about another of the main problems

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:08.000
with the scientific arguments of the bell curve,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.920
which is that Herrnstein and Murray are conspicuously uninterested

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:14.880
in the causes of the things that they're talking about.

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:18.720
Much of the bell curve, for instance, is concerned with proving

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:21.840
that there are substantial differences in cognitive ability

01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:24.400
between different designated racial groups.

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:28.160
But what Herrnstein and Murray never seriously concern themselves with

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.120
is why this supposed divergence happened.

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:35.520
Population groups don't evolve to be different for no reason, do they?

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:38.960
If one group developed better cognitive skills than another group,

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.960
there would have to be some mechanism there

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:44.400
that was leading to higher cognitive ability in that group,

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:48.240
or, I suppose, leading to lower cognitive ability in the other group.

01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:51.280
Now, this could simply be direct evolutionary pressure,

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:54.320
as in different levels of cognitive ability in different groups

01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.800
are being directly selected for.

01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:59.520
Or it could be an indirect, unintended effect

01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:01.680
of a different trait being selected for,

01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:03.840
or some sort of genetic drift,

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:06.320
as generations of different population groups

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:08.320
are isolated enough from each other

01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:11.360
to develop in significantly different ways.

01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:15.120
Whatever the reason, though, there would have to be a reason.

01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:18.080
And we should expect a scientist attempting to argue

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.360
for a substantial difference in ability between different groups

01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:26.560
to therefore maybe be interested in exactly why this difference came about, right?

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:29.520
One of the only times that Herrnstein and Murray

01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.440
show any interest in this question

01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:33.920
is in Appendix Five, where they discuss the work

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:37.200
of Canadian psychologist J. Philippe Rushton,

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:41.760
who wrote the book Race, Evolution, and Behavior in 1995.

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:46.720
Rushton alleges that brain and genital size are inversely related,

01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:50.800
and that larger genitals correlate with an increased fertility.

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:55.280
So at some point, different designated racial groups diverged from one another

01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:59.760
and developed different traits according to some sort of trade-off system.

01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:02.560
So it's like a computer game where you have limited points

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.240
to put into your starting stats,

02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:08.640
only here the starting stats are int and genital size.

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:14.400
In 1988, Rushton was reprimanded by the University of Western Ontario

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:17.120
for carrying out two particular studies.

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:19.760
He surveyed first-year psychology students

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:22.960
and then male customers at a Toronto shopping mall,

02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:25.600
asking them questions about their sex lives,

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:27.440
the size of their penises,

02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:30.560
and the exact distance that they ejaculate.

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.000
Now, I can only speak for myself here,

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:36.640
but I can't say I've ever measured.

02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:42.080
One therefore wonders how reliable this self-reported data could be.

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:45.760
Or, who knows, maybe I'm the anomaly here.

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:50.320
Maybe all you penis-havers out there are keeping detailed daily statistics.

02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:51.360
I don't know.

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:57.200
One also wonders about exactly how distance is supposed to come into play here.

02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:59.200
For want of a better phrase.

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:03.680
What does this Rushton guy think is going on in the bedroom?

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:07.280
Does he think you have to hit a moving target or something?

02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:07.840
I don't know.

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:12.480
Rushton's work also uses the same caucasoid, mongoloid,

02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:15.680
negroid categorization that Richard Limb uses.

02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:17.920
And to quote a response to Rushton's theories

02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:20.480
by Canadian psychologist Zach Cenovsky,

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.000
some of Rushton's references to scientific literature

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.200
with respects to racial differences and sexual characteristics

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:32.480
turned out to be references to a non-scientific semi-pornographic book

02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:35.120
and to an article in the penthouse forum.

02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:39.280
I am mentioning Rushton and his weird genital theories here,

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:42.640
not just because they're funny to relate, which they certainly are,

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.640
but because he and his research are defended in the bell curve.

02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:49.760
Herrnstein and Murray relay his ideas before stating,

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:59.920
However, Rushton's work is not that of a crackpot or a bigot,

02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:02.320
as many of his critics are given to charging.

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:04.720
But they're wrong there, of course.

02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:07.280
He is a crackpot and a bigot.

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:09.760
Or he was, anyway. He's dead now.

02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:12.960
As for why Herrnstein and Murray seem so disinterested

02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:16.160
in examining causes for the things that they're discussing,

02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:17.920
I can only speculate here.

02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:22.080
But I suspect it's because, at least with regards to the bell curve, anyway,

02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:25.280
Herrnstein and Murray are not scientists.

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.080
They didn't even submit the bell curve for peer review prior to its publication.

02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.240
They are here to advance a conservative social and political agenda,

02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:39.280
and all the air quotes science is just window dressing for that agenda.

02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:41.520
And that's what we're going to talk about next.

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.560
So then, the politics of the bell curve.

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:49.920
And I'd like to first talk a bit more about why the bell curve was so controversial.

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:55.520
And there's one main reason comprised of two, uh, sub reasons.

02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.520
The first is that Herrnstein and Murray spend a large part of their book

02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.080
asserting differences in intelligence between designated racial groups.

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:06.800
And we have to wonder why they even did this,

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:09.840
because it isn't important at all for their overall point.

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:14.080
Their main argument is that IQ is the most important factor

02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.400
determining success or failure in life,

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:20.080
and they seemingly don't need the racial element at all to make this point.

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:21.920
Or do they?

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:26.480
In a section titled How Ethnic Differences Fit Into the Story,

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:27.920
they write the following.

02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:31.920
In part one, we described the formation of a cognitive elite.

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:35.040
Given the cognitive differences among ethnic and racial groups,

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:38.560
the cognitive elite cannot represent all groups equally,

02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:41.920
a statement with implications that we will develop in part four.

02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:47.040
Part four being the section of the book comprised of their policy proposals,

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:51.040
and it is these policy proposals that are the second part of the reason

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.080
for the bell curve being such a controversial book.

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:58.000
More than either of these things individually being controversial,

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.920
it's how they interact that really produces the controversy.

02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:06.000
You see, for all Herrnstein and Murray's posturing about how brave they're being,

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.640
speaking out and breaking taboos and all that,

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:12.240
it is not actually controversial in the scientific community

02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:15.920
to simply acknowledge group differences in IQ.

02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:18.000
Let's imagine that instead of the bell curve,

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.080
Herrnstein and Murray had simply published a list of IQ test results

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:24.960
showing differences in IQ in different countries.

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.280
Nobody would have cared.

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:29.600
Researchers from across the political spectrum

02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:32.560
work with intelligence test data all the time.

02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:34.640
Some environment-minded researchers,

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:37.840
because they acknowledge that the group differences exist,

02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:40.720
but they want to prove that environmental factors

02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.560
are the key to understanding them.

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.720
Nor is it controversial to assert that differences in cognitive ability

02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:49.680
in general are partially due to genetics.

02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:55.040
There are a whole host of genetic conditions that can affect someone's cognitive ability.

02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:58.160
Right-wingers who characterize lefties as die-hard,

02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:01.520
100% environmentalists miss the point here,

02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:04.400
as we'd actually be hasty to point out the ableism

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:07.360
in denying the effects of those genetic conditions.

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:11.920
So it's not simply that Herrnstein and Murray are breaking the supposed taboo

02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:15.840
of discussing IQ differences that sparked the backlash.

02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:21.200
It's that they explicitly link those differences to a set of policy proposals.

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:26.400
This is why the bell curve is controversial, because of its political ideas.

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:27.840
So let's talk about those.

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:30.880
First off, the enormous glaring problem

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:34.560
with the vast majority of Herrnstein and Murray's policy proposals

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:37.680
is that they absolutely do not logically follow

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:40.640
from any of their previous claims in the bell curve.

02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:45.200
And if it sounds like I'm exaggerating there, trust me, I am not.

02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.640
Take, for instance, their account of programs like Head Start

02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:51.280
that are designed to help disadvantaged kids.

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:54.480
Herrnstein and Murray acknowledge that these programs

02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.960
can have temporary positive effects,

02:05:56.960 --> 02:06:00.480
but they argue that these positive effects fade over time

02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:05.280
and become statistically insignificant by the time those children leave school.

02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:07.600
This is taken by Herrnstein and Murray as proof

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:11.200
that there is ultimately nothing to be done to help these kids.

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:14.800
Any temporary positive effects will simply fade away

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:17.200
due to their inferior genetics.

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:19.440
So we should stop wasting money on them

02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:22.800
and instead give it to the naturally gifted children.

02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:24.800
This does not follow, however.

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.760
There is an alternative interpretation of this situation,

02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:29.360
which is perfectly consistent

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:33.440
with a majority environmental understanding of childhood development.

02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:37.120
We can argue that these programs produce a positive effect

02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:40.320
because they are changing the children's environment.

02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:43.520
Any diminished effects after the programs stop

02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:46.080
are because the programs stopped,

02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:49.360
thus changing the environment back to the norm.

02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:51.520
So instead of abandoning these programs,

02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:53.040
we should instead take them as proof

02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:56.880
that environmental changes can produce positive effects

02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:00.480
and then expand them, increase their funding,

02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:04.080
have equivalent programs for every stage of school life.

02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:08.240
Any later diminished effects are proof that we aren't trying hard enough,

02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:11.280
not that what we're trying to do is impossible.

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:13.920
Nearly every policy proposal in the bell curve

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:17.200
has this sort of alternative explanation.

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:21.760
One of their proposals for dissuading low IQ mothers from having children

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:25.040
is to stop the welfare programs that support them.

02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:28.720
But as we know, richer people tend to have fewer children,

02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:33.120
and birth rates are lower in countries with comprehensive welfare programs.

02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:37.680
Making these women poorer will not make them have fewer children.

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:40.160
And besides, Hernstein and Murray are arguing

02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:43.120
that these women are resolutely unintelligent.

02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.320
So if that were true,

02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:47.520
why would we be expecting them to be able to plan ahead

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.360
and reason logically that having fewer children is a good idea?

02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:54.320
That they're not supposed to be able to plan well for the future

02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:56.000
is kind of the whole point, right?

02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:58.480
What Hernstein and Murray could have done here

02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:03.120
is some very basic comparisons between the United States and other countries.

02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:06.640
They scaremonger about the possible effects of welfare programs

02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:09.760
which exist in Europe in abundance, for instance.

02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:12.160
But since those European welfare programs

02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:14.720
have not led to the sort of utter catastrophe

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:16.720
that Hernstein and Murray prophesize,

02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:20.400
they instead choose to focus only on the United States.

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.880
Even if Hernstein and Murray had proven

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:26.320
that some groups were genetically less intelligent than others,

02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:29.040
cutting welfare would not follow from that.

02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:33.360
Rather, one could make the argument that those groups would deserve more welfare

02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:37.440
because they would have an unfair disadvantage in school and in work

02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:39.440
that would not be their fault.

02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:43.520
And even worse than Hernstein and Murray's logic simply not following,

02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:49.600
their proposals sometimes actually directly contradict with their previous analysis.

02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:52.800
For example, let's talk about affirmative action.

02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:57.520
As mentioned earlier, Hernstein and Murray really don't like affirmative action.

02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:00.000
And as we've also seen, they are very worried

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.920
about the supposed cognitive stratification of society.

02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:06.320
And let's briefly quote them talking about that.

02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:09.440
In this penultimate chapter, we speculate about the impact

02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:13.120
of cognitive stratification on American life and government.

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.920
Predicting the course of society is chancy,

02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:19.280
but certain tendencies seem strong enough to worry about.

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:22.160
An increasingly isolated cognitive elite,

02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.960
a merging of the cognitive elite with the affluent,

02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.680
a deteriorating quality of life for people

02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:30.960
at the bottom end of the cognitive ability distribution.

02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:35.760
Unchecked, these trends will lead the US towards something resembling a caste society

02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:38.560
with the underclass mired ever more firmly at the bottom

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:41.840
and the cognitive elite ever more firmly anchored at the top,

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:43.920
restructuring the rules of society

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:47.040
so that it becomes harder and harder for them to lose.

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:49.760
Among the other casualties of this process

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:53.360
would be American civil society as we have known it.

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:58.720
Like other apocalyptic visions, this one is pessimistic, perhaps too much so.

02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:01.680
On the other hand, there is much to be pessimistic about.

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:04.960
Now what Hernstein and Murray fail to spot here

02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:07.920
is that a policy of aggressive affirmative action

02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:11.360
would directly work to check the cognitive partitioning

02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:13.760
that they call frightening and apocalyptic.

02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.480
If Harvard or some other fancy school

02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:19.680
decided they were gonna admit a certain percentage of applicants

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:23.360
based upon some characteristic other than test scores,

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:26.800
then there would be that same number of applicants with higher test scores

02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:29.040
who would therefore not get into Harvard

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:31.920
and have to go to their next choice of college.

02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:35.200
And the next smartest people who would have gone to that college

02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:38.240
will now not get in and have to go to their next choice

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:40.080
and so on down the line.

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.560
And if this ruthless affirmative action policy

02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:45.280
was adopted by the group of colleges as a whole,

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:47.680
the cognitive elite would be forced to spread out

02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:49.520
throughout the whole college pool,

02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:53.920
which would have the added effect of spreading them out geographically too.

02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:56.640
Hernstein and Murray really should have spotted this,

02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:59.040
since earlier in the book they talk fondly

02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:02.240
about Harvard's policy of admitting legacy applicants,

02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:06.080
those usually being people whose fathers had graduated from Harvard.

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:09.520
They also mention applicants being considered for things like

02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:13.840
his potential as a quarterback or stroke for the eight-man shell

02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:16.640
and other non-academic qualities.

02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:19.920
Curiously, Hernstein and Murray do not criticize

02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:24.080
Harvard's practice of admitting people for non-academic reasons.

02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:26.560
When it comes to affirmative action, however,

02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:30.640
Hernstein and Murray are very clear about that being unfair,

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:31.520
and I quote,

02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:34.000
"...to what extent is a society fair

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.400
when people of similar ability and background

02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:38.800
are treated as differently as they are now?"

02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:42.640
In 1964, the answer would have been unambiguous.

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:45.680
Such a society is manifestly unfair.

02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:48.560
The logic was right then, and right now.

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:52.080
So colleges admitting applicants for non-academic reasons,

02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:55.120
such as their father having gone there, that's okay.

02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:59.760
It's counteracting the dreaded cognitive partitioning of society, after all.

02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:03.200
But colleges admitting applicants because of affirmative action,

02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:05.440
well that is, rather dramatically,

02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:08.320
leaking a poison into the American soul.

02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:11.680
So how do we account for this apparent contradiction

02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:13.920
on behalf of Hernstein and Murray?

02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:17.360
Well, what would you imagine to be the most likely difference

02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:22.480
between a legacy Harvard applicant and an affirmative action applicant?

02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:26.000
I will leave it to you to ponder that one.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.320
Instead of the unfair and poisonous racial affirmative action,

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:34.960
Hernstein and Murray argue instead for a race-blind version of affirmative action

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:38.480
based, bizarrely, on test scores.

02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:42.720
And I say bizarrely here because this idea would actually accelerate

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:46.160
the supposedly apocalyptic cognitive partitioning.

02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:49.040
They say that in the case of two candidates

02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:51.040
who are fairly closely matched otherwise,

02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:55.520
universities should give the nod to the applicant from the disadvantaged background.

02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:58.160
Now, I agree with this in isolation here.

02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:00.880
I do think that if you have two similar candidates,

02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:03.120
you should admit the less privileged one.

02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:07.600
But with regards to Hernstein and Murray's fears of cognitive partitioning, though,

02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:10.320
this is exactly what they were worried about.

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:15.120
College is becoming better at collecting all of society's high IQ people together

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:19.520
and funneling them into high IQ jobs in high IQ areas.

02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.720
They've basically said,

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:25.680
here's an apocalyptic problem and now here's how to make it happen faster.

02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:29.360
And actually, regarding the concept of affirmative action,

02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:31.840
their logic is all wrong there.

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:36.320
At the start of the chapter titled Affirmative Action in Higher Education,

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.200
Hernstein and Murray recount an affirmative action controversy from 1991

02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:44.320
where a law student at Georgetown University, quote,

02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:47.040
surreptitiously compiled the entrance statistics

02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.840
for a sample of applicants to Georgetown's law school

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:54.400
and then published the results of his research in the law school student newspaper.

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:57.920
He revealed that the mean on the law school aptitude test

02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:02.720
differed by a large margin for accepted black and white students.

02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:04.720
Hernstein and Murray dubbed this difference

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:08.640
the ethnic premium or edge that minority applicants

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:12.080
are supposedly being afforded in the admissions process

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:15.440
and go on to detail how they've looked at the college admissions data

02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:21.360
from 26 colleges and found that in the classes entering those in 1991 and 92,

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:24.080
the average SAT scores of the black students

02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:27.760
were below the average SAT scores of the white students.

02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:29.760
Hernstein and Murray take this as proof

02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:34.080
that black students have an unfair edge in the college admissions process.

02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:38.720
Quote, the summary statement about affirmative action in undergraduate institutions

02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:41.680
is that being either a black or a Latino

02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:44.240
is worth a great deal in the admissions process

02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:48.080
at every undergraduate school for which we have data.

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:52.720
However, this method of measuring the supposed results of affirmative action

02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:54.720
is entirely incorrect.

02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:57.680
There is a crucial flaw in the logic here

02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:01.600
and it begins with Hernstein and Murray's decision to begin their analysis

02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:05.840
by looking at the college entrance data instead of earlier

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:09.600
by thinking about the wider pool of college applicants.

02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:14.160
So black people have historically had lower SAT scores than white people.

02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:19.360
Now whether you believe this is due to some fixed genetically originated lower IQ

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:22.960
or you're sensible and you believe it's down to environmental reasons,

02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:24.240
it is the case.

02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:28.960
So in any random group of students applying to a college in the United States,

02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:33.040
we would expect the scores of the black students to be on average

02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:35.600
lower than the white students if you follow.

02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:39.520
So what happens next is the college takes a look at this group of applicants

02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:43.840
and decides to omit some of them using certain criteria.

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:46.640
So test scores but usually various other things

02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:49.840
like extracurricular activities and whatever else.

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:52.320
So all the accepted students get in

02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:56.320
and all the denied students go off to apply somewhere else, right?

02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.720
Then Hernstein and Murray come along to the college

02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:01.440
and they notice that the scores of the black students

02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:03.680
are on average below the white students

02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:08.080
and thus start decrying the terrible unfairness of affirmative action.

02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:10.640
But what they've missed here is that this discrepancy

02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:13.920
between the average black and white scores would still exist

02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:19.040
even if the college admissions process only considered test scores and nothing else.

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:20.640
And let's think about this.

02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:23.920
Imagine an American college in 1991

02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:26.560
with a certain amount of positions to fill

02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:31.040
and they get a larger group of students applying for those positions, right?

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:34.160
So they have to let some in and not others.

02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:37.760
In that group of applicants there will be a range of test scores

02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:42.720
and the black applicants will have on average lower scores than the white applicants.

02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:46.240
And let's say this college only admits people via test scores

02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:49.200
so if they have 1,000 positions to fill

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:54.800
they only accept the top 1,000 SAT scores and they send everyone else packing.

02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:58.240
Now in this group of 1,000 successful applicants

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:00.960
there will still be both black and white people

02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:04.400
but of those black people who scored high enough to get in

02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:08.480
they will be on average towards the lower end of the range.

02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:12.640
Meaning the black group average will still be lower than the white group average

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:16.000
even though they all scored high enough to get in.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.320
Even in a world without affirmative action

02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:21.600
and even with a totally racially blind admissions policy

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:25.680
and accepting Hearnstein and Murray's positions regarding racial IQ scores

02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:31.520
a disparity between black and white SAT scores in college intake groups would still exist.

02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:35.600
The only way we could fairly expect the two averages to be the same

02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:39.680
is if the black and white students in that 1991 applicant pool

02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:42.800
also had on average the same scores.

02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.640
And since Hearnstein and Murray have just spent a huge section of their book

02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:49.760
arguing for black people's lower cognitive ability

02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:52.400
I don't know why they'd be expecting that.

02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:55.920
Moving on from affirmative action I'd like to ask a question.

02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:01.040
Can the politics of the bell curve be described as eugenics?

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:02.960
And I mean yes, right?

02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:06.800
They're arguing for policies with the agenda of changing birth rates

02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:08.800
for particular groups of people.

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:12.320
They want lower IQ mothers to have fewer children.

02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:16.800
Hearnstein and Murray stop short of openly embracing eugenics however.

02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:21.360
They pull a rhetorical trick by saying they're simply worried about dysgenics.

02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:24.080
Dysgenics being the opposite of eugenics there.

02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:29.120
So we're not necessarily for it but we are anti the opposite of it.

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:30.240
You know, it's very clever.

02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:36.320
One telling quote here is when Hearnstein and Murray talking about the Nazis say the following

02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:40.560
followed by the terrors of Nazism and its perversion of eugenics

02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:44.000
that effectively wiped the idea from public discourse in the West.

02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:49.760
Now the phrase perversion of eugenics should set off some alarm bells there

02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:53.120
implying apparently that there is a good sort of eugenics

02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:57.520
and the Nazis just did it wrong or took it too far or something.

02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:02.240
Or maybe there was just something uniquely evil about Nazi eugenics

02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:05.920
that wasn't present in the supposedly good eugenics.

02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:06.800
Is that true?

02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:09.280
Well, let's find out.

02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:13.440
The footage you're seeing here is from a movie called Herb Crank.

02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:16.000
In English, the Hereditary Defective.

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:22.400
This is a 1936 propaganda film produced by the Nazi party's racial policy office.

02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:25.600
It features video shots at German psychiatric hospitals

02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:28.320
of people with various types of disabilities

02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:31.840
interspersed with text informing the audience, among other things,

02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:34.640
of the expense of caring for these people.

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:40.480
Going on to argue that the prevention of hereditarily sick offspring is a moral duty.

02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.840
Now I'm not actually showing the images of the people in the video here

02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:46.800
as they almost certainly did not consent to be in a film

02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:50.480
which was used to propagandize in favor of their sterilization

02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:53.920
and I would feel uncomfortable including that footage in my video.

02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:58.720
Herb Crank is available online though if you prefer to watch it unedited.

02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:00.240
The film ends with the quote,

02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:05.120
the farmer who prevents the overgrowth of the weed promotes the valuable.

02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:09.120
The purpose of this film was obviously to increase public support

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:12.880
for the involuntary sterilization of people with disabilities,

02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:17.600
a Nazi program that would escalate into outright mass murder just a few years later.

02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:20.480
Adolf Hitler was reportedly a fan of Herb Crank

02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:22.960
and encouraged the production of a sequel titled

02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:26.960
Victims of the Past, The Sin Against Blood and Race

02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:31.040
which was shown in cinemas throughout Nazi Germany in 1937.

02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:34.320
So why am I talking about Herb Crank here?

02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:37.840
Is this simply a slippery slope argument perhaps?

02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:42.160
Look where all this eugenics rubbish leads to the Nazis and the Holocaust.

02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:46.240
Now although I think that would be a fair point to make actually,

02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:52.160
no this particular movie has a much more direct link to what we're talking about today.

02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:54.160
Now something that might come as a shock to you

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:57.840
and it certainly did to me in the process of researching this video

02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:02.640
is the extent of the international eugenics movement prior to World War II.

02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:06.640
Nazi eugenicists were not operating in a bubble

02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:10.400
and most importantly for us here is that they had a reciprocal relationship

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:12.080
with American eugenicists.

02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:16.240
You see Herb Crank had another big fan in addition to Hitler.

02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:21.040
So this guy is Harry H. Loughlin, an American eugenicist,

02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:23.520
director of the Eugenics Record Office

02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:27.680
and founding member of the American Eugenics Society.

02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:30.240
He likes eugenics if you didn't pick up on that.

02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:34.080
Now in 1922 Harry Loughlin published a book titled

02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:36.960
Eugenical Sterilization in the United States

02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:41.840
which included a chapter titled Model Eugenical Sterilization Law.

02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:43.360
This model law begins

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:49.600
an act to prevent the procreation of persons socially inadequate from defective inheritance

02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:53.440
by authorizing and providing for the eugenical sterilization

02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:58.400
of certain potential parents carrying degenerate hereditary qualities.

02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:01.520
This law designates a socially inadequate person

02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:06.400
as someone who fails chronically in comparison with normal persons

02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:08.560
to maintain himself or herself

02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:12.560
as a useful member of the organized social life of the state.

02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:16.000
These socially inadequate people were not just the ill

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:21.200
but also for example the criminalistic, the inebriate and the dependent

02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:27.360
including orphans, ne'er-do-wells, the homeless, tramps and paupers.

02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:30.800
18 US states passed laws based upon Loughlin's model

02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:34.320
and between them sterilized tens of thousands of people.

02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:40.560
And in 1933 somewhere else passed a law which was based upon Loughlin's model.

02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:44.480
The law for the prevention of hereditarily diseased offspring

02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:48.320
which actually was slightly more moderate than what the model law proposed

02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:49.600
if you can believe it.

02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:52.320
This was of course Nazi Germany.

02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:56.960
Loughlin was later awarded an honorary degree by the University of Heidelberg

02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:59.120
for his work on behalf of the quote,

02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:01.360
science of racial cleansing.

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:04.640
Loughlin was also an open Nazi party supporter

02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:08.080
writing enthusiastically about Nazi Germany's eugenics laws

02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:11.200
in a publication titled Eugenic News.

02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:14.080
And why shouldn't he be excited about them?

02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:15.680
I mean, he wrote them.

02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:18.960
In addition to inspiring Nazi party policy

02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:22.560
Loughlin also helped to disseminate their propaganda.

02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:27.040
In 1936 he purchased an English translation of Erbcrank

02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:30.880
and raised funds to have it shown in American high schools,

02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:32.080
which it was.

02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:34.880
That's right, just a couple of years before the Nazis

02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:38.480
started systematically murdering people with disabilities

02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:42.560
this Nazi eugenics movie was actually shown in American schools

02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:46.480
and this event was reported on favorably in the Nazi press.

02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:49.120
Loughlin raised the funds to distribute the film

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:51.600
by writing to Wycliffe Draper

02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:54.560
who was another American eugenicist and racist

02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:57.760
and importantly for Loughlin, a millionaire.

02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:02.880
Together in 1937 Loughlin and Draper founded the Pioneer Fund

02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:07.520
the purpose of which was to promote the genetic stock of people quote,

02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:11.440
deemed to be descended predominantly from white persons

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:16.640
who settled in the original 13 states prior to the adoption of the constitution.

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:20.720
Now besides subjecting school children to Nazi propaganda

02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:24.560
the Pioneer Fund set about supporting massive air quotes

02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:27.360
research into race betterment

02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:33.040
giving enormous grants to any researcher willing to push a pro-eugenics agenda

02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:37.680
and here, dear video watchers, is where we rejoin the bell curve.

02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:41.600
Richard Lin, you remember, the guy who thinks the single best study

02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:46.160
of the quote, negroid intelligence was carried out under apartheid.

02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:50.720
He's received over $600,000 from the Pioneer Fund

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:56.320
and currently, as in now, currently today, is the head of the Pioneer Fund

02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:59.440
because it is still going and he is still alive.

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:03.040
Mankind Quarterly, the journal which published Lin's work

02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:06.880
that is cited in the bell curve, is funded by the Pioneer Fund.

02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:11.120
Mankind Quarterly includes among its founders Henry Garrett

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:15.120
an American psychologist who testified in favor of segregated schools

02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:17.520
during Brown versus Board of Education

02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:22.400
Corrado Gini, who was president of the Italian Genetics and Eugenics Society

02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:23.920
in Fascist Italy

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:26.400
and Othmar Freiherr von Verschuer

02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:30.000
who was director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.880
Human Heredity and Eugenics in Nazi Germany

02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:35.280
was a member of the Nazi Party

02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:39.920
and, believe it or not, the mentor of Joseph Mengele.

02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:44.560
Joseph Mengele, of course, being the physician at the Auschwitz concentration camp

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:48.960
infamous for performing human experimentation on the prisoners.

02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:53.840
During World War II, Mengele provided Verschuer with human remains from Auschwitz

02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:56.720
to use in his research into eugenics.

02:25:56.720 --> 02:25:59.920
That is who founded Mankind Quarterly.

02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:05.200
Editor of The New Republic, Charles Lane, writing about the bell curve in 1994

02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:09.440
noted that five articles from the journal, that's Mankind Quarterly,

02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:12.240
are actually cited in the bell curve's bibliography

02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:17.040
but the influence on the book from scholars linked to Mankind Quarterly is more significant.

02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:21.280
No fewer than 17 researchers cited in the bibliography of the bell curve

02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:23.680
have contributed to Mankind Quarterly.

02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:29.280
Ten are present or former editors or members of its editorial advisory board.

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:34.640
J. Philippe Rushton, the guy wandering around asking people how far they can ejaculate

02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:38.880
he was president of the Pioneer Fund from 2002 to 2012

02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:41.760
received hundreds of thousands of dollars from it

02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:45.840
and he used Pioneer Funds to mail 40,000 copies of his book

02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:49.600
Race, Evolution and Behavior to various social scientists.

02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:54.240
Another Pioneer Fund recipient was American anthropologist Donald Swan.

02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:59.120
Now in 1966, Donald Swan was arrested on charges of mail fraud.

02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:01.600
When the police investigated Swan's apartment

02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:05.840
they found an assortment of illegal weapons, a stash of racist literature,

02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:08.960
Nazi memorabilia including flags and a helmet

02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:12.880
and photographs of Swan with members of the American Nazi Party.

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:14.560
Oops.

02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:18.240
Do you remember Linda Gottfriedsen, the author of the public statement

02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:20.720
defending the bell curve's claims about intelligence

02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:23.680
that I mentioned way back at the start of the video?

02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:30.800
Well as of 1994, she'd received $267,000 from the Pioneer Fund.

02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:33.120
And speaking of that public statement actually,

02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:38.080
the Southern Poverty Law Center notes that more than 20 of the 52 signatories

02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:40.640
were themselves Pioneer Fund recipients.

02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:46.240
And crucially for us here, the Pioneer Fund wanted to fund Richard Herrnstein.

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:51.360
The head of the fund prior to J. Philippe Rushton was a lawyer called Harry F. Weyer

02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:54.720
and in 1994, the year that the bell curve came out,

02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:58.320
he told a journalist interviewing him that regarding Herrnstein

02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:02.640
we'd have funded him at the drop of a hat but he never asked.

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:05.680
Now the fact that the bell curve includes among its sources

02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:08.640
a bunch of people who receive money from the Nazi Fund

02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:11.040
and publish papers in the Nazi journal

02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:14.960
was understandably cause for concern for many when it was published

02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:18.720
and this was used frequently to dismiss the book's arguments.

02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:22.400
So Murray includes a very short defense of the Pioneer Fund

02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:25.920
in his afterword to the bell curve which reads as follows.

02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:30.080
The relationship between the founder of the Pioneer Fund and today's Pioneer Fund

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:34.240
is roughly analogous to that between Henry Ford and today's Ford Foundation.

02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:38.720
So he's saying, you know, it may have been founded by pro-Nazi eugenicists

02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:40.640
but today it's completely different.

02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:45.840
The trouble is, Murray includes absolutely no evidence to back this statement up.

02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:47.760
He treats it as a given.

02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:53.760
But actually, the Pioneer Fund has been unwavering in its support for eugenics over the years.

02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:56.000
Richard Lynn, the current head of the fund,

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.640
works with the explicitly white supremacist publication American Renaissance

02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:02.480
and speaks at their conferences.

02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:06.640
The white supremacist editor of American Renaissance, Jared Taylor,

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:11.440
who viewers of my other videos will remember, is funded by the Pioneer Fund.

02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:15.440
So I don't buy Charles Murray just saying it has changed.

02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:18.480
He doesn't give evidence for why he thinks that

02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:21.120
and there is ample evidence against it.

02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:26.000
Anyway, it's about time to wrap this video up with a few final thoughts, I think.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:30.560
But let's first briefly summarize our main counter-arguments to the bell curve.

02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:34.320
Firstly, the bell curve does not prove that genetics are the primary reason

02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:36.000
for differences in intelligence.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.720
The authors are not geneticists, they're a psychologist and a social scientist.

02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:45.680
Their estimates of the importance of genes are based on suppositions and guesses.

02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:49.840
After failing to make the case that IQ is genetic in origin,

02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:53.600
they compare that IQ not to one's social background,

02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:55.840
as the back cover of the book promises,

02:29:55.840 --> 02:30:00.880
but a much more narrowly defined index of parental socioeconomic status,

02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:04.400
which includes only a few of the relevant variables.

02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:09.120
The main source of their data is more a test of academic achievement than intelligence

02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:13.200
and since it did not return a normal bell curve distribution,

02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:15.600
Hernstein and Murray manipulated the data

02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:19.520
to exaggerate what were previously much smaller differences.

02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:24.480
After a completely unnecessary section making the case for racial IQ differences,

02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:26.880
they include a set of policy proposals,

02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:30.800
most of which do not follow logically from their previous analysis

02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:33.040
and some of which contradict it.

02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:37.360
And of course, Hernstein and Murray's willingness to quote highly questionable data

02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:41.520
from even more questionable sources should be very worrisome,

02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:44.640
even if you happen to agree with them otherwise.

02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:48.080
Having now read a lot of criticism of the bell curve,

02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:53.840
I think I've identified a particular difficulty that people have in arguing against it.

02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:59.120
And it's a tendency to argue with not the opinions that Hernstein and Murray claim to hold,

02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:02.000
but the opinions that they would have to hold

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.360
in order to support the policy proposals which they do.

02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:08.720
For example, it makes no sense to claim that IQ

02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:12.080
explains only a tiny amount of the variance between people

02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:15.120
and that you cannot know what someone will do from their IQ,

02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:16.880
as Hernstein and Murray do,

02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:19.840
and then move on to claim that IQ is one of the best ways

02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:23.120
of determining an employee's individual productivity

02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:26.960
and employers should pick applicants with the highest IQs.

02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:31.360
A passing critic of the bell curve who hears this latter claim might then respond,

02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:32.720
but that makes no sense.

02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:36.400
IQ explains only a tiny amount of the variance between people.

02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:39.440
You can't know what someone will do from their IQ.

02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:41.920
To which defenders of the bell curve respond,

02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:45.760
aha, you didn't read the book because they say that in there.

02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:49.840
Now this gotcha tactic, as satisfying as it might be,

02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:53.520
does not actually explain the contradiction, however.

02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:56.960
This is the main rhetorical trick of the bell curve.

02:31:56.960 --> 02:32:01.200
They pretend to concede to mainstream scientific opinion,

02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:06.240
but then propose a set of conservative and eugenicist political policies

02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:07.600
as if they hadn't.

02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:12.320
Anyone who genuinely believed all the moderate hedging quotes

02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:14.800
that Hernstein and Murray put in the bell curve

02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:18.000
would not be able to propose the policies that they do.

02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:21.440
So the critics of the bell curve see these policies

02:32:21.440 --> 02:32:23.680
and start arguing against the opinions

02:32:23.680 --> 02:32:27.920
that they assume Hernstein and Murray would therefore have to hold.

02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:30.320
Thus the repeated defense of the bell curve

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:34.080
is that the authors can't be racist or biased or bigoted,

02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:35.520
as their critics claim,

02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:39.200
because in their book they say that they're not.

02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:42.000
The critics must therefore have not read the book.

02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:45.840
This is not the airtight defense they think it is.

02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:48.640
We care about their political proposals,

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:51.200
not how moderate they pretended to be

02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:55.520
in order to camouflage their approach to those political proposals.

02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:58.240
One could, if one wanted, go through my video

02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:00.640
and find corresponding quotes in the bell curve

02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:03.040
for pretty much all of my counterarguments.

02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:07.360
See, they also worry about the dangers of social engineering.

02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:11.280
They also paraphrase Lewontin's thought experiment with the plants.

02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:14.720
They also talk about the various problems with IQ testing.

02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:18.000
They also call the existence of G arguable.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.160
They say all this in the book,

02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:21.840
so therefore they've addressed it

02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:25.360
and your counterarguments are nullified, right?

02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:28.240
The problem is, putting all that in the book

02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:32.800
didn't stop them from advocating for the political policies that they do,

02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:33.840
and it should have.

02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:37.600
If, with regards to how much genes influence intelligence,

02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:39.840
you spend a whole book saying things like

02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:43.360
the state of knowledge does not permit a precise estimate,

02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:45.920
but then you go on to propose a set of policies

02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:51.120
that only make sense if intelligence is definitely primarily genetic in origin,

02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:53.200
you are contradicting yourself.

02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:55.680
You don't actually care that the state of knowledge

02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:57.600
does not permit a precise estimate.

02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:01.280
That apparently isn't going to stop you from acting as if it does.

02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:05.120
I'm guilty myself of several times arguing against the point

02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:07.680
that Herrnstein and Murray should have made

02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:10.000
instead of the one that they did make.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.440
Only a minute ago I said

02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:13.600
the bell curve does not prove that genetics

02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:16.240
are the primary reason for differences in intelligence,

02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:17.920
to which the offense is, of course,

02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:19.920
that they never set out to do such a thing.

02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:21.840
But they should have.

02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:23.120
If you don't prove that,

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:25.680
then the rest of the argument doesn't work.

02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:28.560
Now, they couldn't have proved that if they wanted to, of course,

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:30.880
because the data is inconclusive.

02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:33.920
Herrnstein and Murray acknowledged the data is inconclusive,

02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:35.600
but then just keep on trucking,

02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:40.000
assuming firstly that later genetics research will prove them correct,

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:40.960
which it hasn't.

02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:44.400
The data is still inconclusive 25 years later.

02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:48.320
And secondly, assuming that any data which trends against their position

02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:51.200
is due to strictly temporary effects.

02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:53.680
Rising IQ scores are thus explained away

02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:57.440
as being due to an increase in test-taking ability or elsewhere,

02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:00.320
as due to the data being distorted by the baby boom.

02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:04.560
Rising standards of living can raise a country's average IQ,

02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:07.120
but only to a point, it is assumed.

02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:09.760
Black and white IQ scores are converging,

02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:12.240
but they may be expected to stop,

02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:15.280
and the gap could even begin to widen again.

02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:19.520
So predicting the future on this issue is little more than guesswork at this point.

02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:22.720
All the trends that contradict what the authors of the bell curve

02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:26.960
would quite clearly like to be true are assumed to be time-limited.

02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:29.520
You get the sense that Herrnstein and Murray are implying

02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:32.000
that once we get to the end of history,

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.880
once things stop happening to make the data look like we're wrong,

02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:37.920
then you'll see.

02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:39.200
You'll all see.

02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:43.680
In just a few more years, you'll see that we were right all along.

02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:46.400
Of course, to a reader in 2019,

02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:48.720
all this, as with much of the rest of the book,

02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:50.880
comes off as rather quaint.

02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:53.520
A relic of the 90s, maybe.

02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:54.560
Like pogs.

02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:58.320
You see, today, of course, we have social media

02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:01.680
and daily get to see just how cognitively elite

02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:04.080
the supposed cognitive elite are.

02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:07.920
Herrnstein and Murray's theory of intellectual inequality

02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:12.400
is, of course, just economic inequality with the license plates changed.

02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:14.640
And I can think of no better illustration of this

02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:18.480
than the college admissions bribery scandal from earlier this year.

02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:22.480
This was a criminal conspiracy organized by William Rick Singer

02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:25.760
to doctor exam results and bribe college officials

02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:28.480
in order to ensure children of rich parents

02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.720
get into several top universities.

02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:35.440
Singer testified that he'd helped more than 750 families

02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:37.440
get children into college this way,

02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:41.120
and he furthermore claimed that some of the tactics he used to inflate test scores

02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:44.880
were widespread outside of his particular scheme.

02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:49.280
The problem, of course, is not that the rich are getting smarter,

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:51.520
it's that the rich are getting richer

02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.960
and can increasingly rig the system to their own benefit.

02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:58.720
The fact that the rich definitely aren't cognitively elite

02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.960
is increasingly becoming a problem, thanks to our imbalanced economies.

02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:07.040
In 2008, this cognitive elite caused an economic crash

02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:10.960
and had to be bailed out by all the middle bell curve average people.

02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:15.440
Lastly here, I'd like to say that the bell curve proves, if anything,

02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:18.720
that any apprehension the scientific community might have

02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:22.800
about discussing possible differences in racial cognitive ability

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:25.200
would be very well justified.

02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:27.440
Because what you shouldn't want to happen,

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:31.120
as a scientist presenting inconclusive evidence for such,

02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:34.080
is for someone hearing that inconclusive evidence

02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:36.880
to then start using it as a justification

02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:40.080
to propose eugenicist political policies.

02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:43.200
The bell curve is all this in one package.

02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:47.040
Inconclusive evidence and eugenicist politics.

02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.480
The bell curve has stuck around not because it breaks new ground

02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:51.920
or presents new ideas,

02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:55.760
but because it is a useful pseudo-scientific justification

02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:59.040
for conservatives looking to cut welfare programs

02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:03.200
and racists looking to feel justified in their racism.

02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:06.640
It is a scabrous piece of racial pornography.

02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:10.560
Thanks for watching, folks.

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:14.800
This one took a bit of time to put together.

02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:16.320
I'm sure you've noticed.

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.720
26,000 words, this is.

02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:22.080
Thank you, as always, to my patrons for supporting me

02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:25.760
so that I can keep making ridiculous videos like this one.

02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:28.880
If you'd like to join this list of lovely people,

02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:31.520
I will put a link in the video description below

02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:33.760
that you can check out if you like.

02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:36.960
And I'd like to give an extra thank you to my patrons this time

02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:40.480
for fact-checking a previous draft of this video for me

02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:43.120
and making some very useful suggestions.

02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:45.600
This video would not be half as good as it is

02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:47.680
without all of your excellent feedback,

02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:49.520
so I am very grateful for that.

02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:53.040
I'd also like to thank the people who were able to source

02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:55.920
a few difficult-to-find studies for me.

02:38:55.920 --> 02:38:59.440
Some folks were even kind enough to physically go and photograph

02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:01.760
or scan things that were not available online,

02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:05.040
so thank you so much for helping me out there.

02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:08.400
Thank you also to the editors who helped me out with this video.

02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:11.760
Your contributions and suggestions were fantastic.

02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:13.440
Now, with any project of this length,

02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:17.120
you inevitably end up with a lot of unused material at the end,

02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:19.600
and there is so much that I left out here,

02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:21.280
usually for time reasons,

02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:23.760
because it would just take too long to explain,

02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:26.800
or because it was too complicated and beyond my ability

02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:29.520
to present the information in a way that made sense.

02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:33.600
If you'd like to look into the various subjects mentioned today

02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:35.760
in more depth than I do in the video,

02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:39.360
I would recommend checking out the sources and reading list below.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.320
Righty-ho, that's all from me today, folks.

02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:43.920
I'll see you next time.
