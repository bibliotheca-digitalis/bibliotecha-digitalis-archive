00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about The Bell Curve.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,520
The Bell Curve is a 1994 book by psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Murray,

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,960
and by way of an introduction here, I'll read the description of the book that's on the back of my copy.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:23,840
Breaking new ground and old taboos, Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray tell the story of a society in transformation.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,080
At the top, a cognitive elite is forming in which the past key to the best schools and the best jobs is no longer social background,

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,080
but high intelligence.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:40,520
At the bottom, the common denominator of the underclass is increasingly low intelligence rather than racial or social disadvantage.

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,720
The Bell Curve describes the state of scientific knowledge about questions that have been on people's minds for years,

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,160
but have been considered too sensitive to talk about openly.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,160
Among them, IQ's relationship to crime, unemployment, welfare, child neglect, poverty, and illegitimacy,

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,960
ethnic differences in intelligence, trends in fertility among women with different levels of intelligence,

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,160
and what policy can do and cannot do to compensate for differences in intelligence.

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:15,280
Brilliantly argued and meticulously documented, The Bell Curve is the essential first step in coming to grips with the nation's social problems.

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,920
Even though it is now 25 years old, The Bell Curve's ideas have had quite the lasting impact.

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,440
Richard Herrnstein passed away shortly before The Bell Curve was released,

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:31,040
but the other author, Charles Murray, has in recent years, among other things, been on an episode of Making Sense with Sam Harris.

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,080
He's been interviewed on Stefan Molyneux's YouTube channel,

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,160
had his ideas discussed on the Joe Rogan podcast,

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,040
and regular viewers of my channel will remember The Bell Curve being cited in a recent Steven Crowder video.

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:50,280
At the time of the book's release, the backlash against it in certain sections of the media and scientific community was furious.

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,480
Dozens of articles were written by scientists and journalists attacking the book,

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,080
studies were conducted to debunk its claims, whole books were written to debunk its claims, actually,

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,840
and these criticisms were often phrased very harshly.

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,680
Columnist Bob Herbert, writing for the New York Times, described the book as

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,880
as a scabrous piece of racial pornography masquerading as serious scholarship.

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,920
Mr. Murray can protest all he wants, wrote Herbert.

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,200
His book is just a genteel way of calling someone the N-word.

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,240
This controversy ignited by The Bell Curve has also had quite the lasting impact.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,840
When Charles Murray is invited to speak at college campuses, for instance,

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,000
people turn out in protest, often with angry cries of racist, eugenicist, and so on.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,080
And from the enraged reaction to The Bell Curve, a new reader might expect the book to be blatant and unapologetic racist propaganda.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,800
A neo-Nazi screed arguing for the supremacy of the high IQ white race and such things as that.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,600
However, when we actually sit down and read the book, things aren't quite that simple.

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,440
Consider the following quotes.

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,880
If tomorrow you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that all the cognitive differences between races were 100% genetic in origin,

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,360
nothing of any significance should change.

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,720
The knowledge would give you no reason to treat individuals differently than if ethnic differences were 100% environmental.

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,040
In any case, you are not going to learn tomorrow that all cognitive differences between races are 100% genetic in origin

39
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,760
because the scientific state of knowledge, unfinished as it is, already gives sample evidence that environment is part of the story.

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,480
If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other,

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,040
we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other.

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,960
It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,640
What might the mix be?

44
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,200
We are resolutely agnostic on that issue.

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,600
As far as we can determine, the evidence does not justify an estimate.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:02,080
For virtually all the topics we will be discussing, cognitive ability accounts for only small to middling proportions of the variation among people.

47
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:11,520
It almost always explains less than 20% of the variance, to use the statistician's term, usually less than 10% and often less than 5%.

48
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,280
What this means in English is that you cannot predict what a given person will do from his IQ score.

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,960
So what's going on here?

50
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,240
It seems, from these quotes anyway, that the bell curve is actually a fairly reasonable piece of work.

51
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:33,120
These are all relatively mild, middle-of-the-road statements here, so this hardly seems like a scabrous piece of racial pornography so far.

52
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Charles Murray has used quotes from the bell curve, such as we have just read, to defend himself and his work against accusations of racism.

53
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:50,720
Murray and other defenders of the bell curve cast the attacks on the book as resulting from a cowardly reluctance to discuss what they see as difficult scientific truths.

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,880
In particular, a reluctance to discuss possible differences in intelligence across designated racial groups.

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
So this is what we're gonna talk about today.

56
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:07,120
We're gonna take a look at some of the arguments in the bell curve, discuss some of the most common counterarguments, and see if we can figure out what all the fuss is about.

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,680
Did the bell curve deserve its harsh criticism, or is it the case that its critics simply cannot handle the truth?

58
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,920
Before we get to all that, though, as you can see, this video is rather long.

59
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:25,840
I expect people may have to watch this one in multiple parts, so firstly here, let's just take a second to lay out the format of the video today.

60
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,080
First off, we're gonna briefly talk about intelligence and intelligence testing,

61
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,880
and quickly mention a few concepts that are gonna be important going forward, such as Spearman's G and Factor Analysis.

62
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,600
Then we're gonna introduce the bell curve and summarize the arguments of each of its four main sections as fairly as we can.

63
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,480
After that, we'll move on to counterarguments in sections primarily concerned with the concept of a general intelligence,

64
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,960
the possible problems with IQ testing, the bell curve's calculation of IQ versus environmental factors,

65
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,920
and finally, the political arguments and policy proposals found within the book.

66
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,200
I will include time codes to all of these sections below so you can drop out and come back as needed.

67
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,960
Right then, let's get started.

68
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,080
And if we're going to be reading a book that is about intelligence, we should start off by briefly talking about exactly what that is.

69
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,320
Let's imagine that we want to design an intelligence test from scratch.

70
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,920
And to do this, we first have to answer two difficult questions.

71
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,920
The first is, how exactly do we define intelligence?

72
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,360
And this is a particularly tricky thing to do, as we'll see.

73
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,520
Let's start with the dictionary definition of intelligence, which is as good a place to start as any, I suppose.

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,080
And this is from the Oxford English Dictionary.

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,120
Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.

76
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,040
Now, our first problem here is that this definition is rather broad.

77
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,440
Think about all the activities and groups of activities that could fall under this definition of intelligence.

78
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,400
Is one's ability to solve complicated mathematical sums governed by intelligence?

79
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,920
How about the ability to solve a difficult chess puzzle?

80
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,000
I'd imagine we'd say those things are associated with intelligence, right?

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,960
Well, how about the ability to write a great novel or compose a great piece of music?

82
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,360
Are those things influenced by intelligence, or would we merely call that creativity?

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,360
Is knowing whether to pass or shoot in a game of basketball or football influenced by intelligence, or would we merely call that talent?

84
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,000
Or are all of these things some mix of intelligence, talent, and creativity?

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
We can certainly imagine a novel that is written intelligently, for instance.

86
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:42,160
Could we say this is some sort of creative intelligence, or are intelligence and creativity strictly two entirely different concepts?

87
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,480
Is there a difference between memorizing and applying a mathematical function, say,

88
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,640
and memorizing and carrying out a piano piece or a dance routine or a set of football plays?

89
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
If there is a difference, what is it?

90
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,000
By what metric are we declaring some of those things to be governed by intelligence and others not?

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,760
Are there such things as social and emotional intelligence?

92
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,480
What we might call the ability to read a room, to be aware of the emotions of others,

93
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,600
and to react appropriately in interactions with them.

94
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,560
Is intelligence involved there, or should we just call that something like being sociable?

95
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,920
All the various things I just mentioned can be argued to fall under the umbrella of acquiring and applying knowledge and skills, right?

96
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Defining exactly what intelligence is is a very difficult thing to do,

97
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,920
and there is a wide range of opinions among scientists and academics about the best way to go about it.

98
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,480
Following the publication of The Bell Curve and inspired by the harsh criticism it received,

99
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,240
a public statement entitled,

100
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,200
Mainstream Science on Intelligence, was written by Professor Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal.

101
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
The statement sets out to outline,

102
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,440
conclusions regarded as mainstream among researchers on intelligence,

103
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,240
in particular on the nature, origins, and practical consequences of individual and group differences in intelligence.

104
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,440
The statement was sent to 131 researchers of whom 52 signed it,

105
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,240
many of whom are themselves cited in The Bell Curve.

106
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,560
Important for us here is that mainstream science on intelligence gives the following definition of intelligence.

107
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,400
Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems,

108
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,720
think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.

109
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,440
It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test taking smarts.

110
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,640
Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings,

111
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,360
catching on, making sense of things, or figuring out what to do.

112
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,720
My favorite part of this definition is, among other things,

113
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,960
because intelligence is apparently all of this and some other stuff too.

114
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,800
My point here is that even among researchers who are cited in The Bell Curve

115
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,360
and would put their name to a defense of its ideas, intelligence is a very broadly defined concept.

116
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,800
And even if we can agree on a definition of intelligence,

117
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,440
the second difficult question we have to answer is this.

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,400
How exactly do we measure it?

119
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,920
It's not as simple as testing for some other human abilities.

120
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,240
We can measure how fast someone is by using units of time and distance,

121
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,000
and we can measure how strong someone is by using units of weight.

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,840
But what do you use to quantify how smart someone is?

123
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,480
What we need here is an intelligence unit.

124
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
We need a way to express someone's intelligence as a number.

125
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,120
Now, most people today will recognize IQ as the most common intelligence unit,

126
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
and let's briefly talk a little about how that came to be.

127
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,160
So way back in the old days, if we wanted to determine someone's personality traits and abilities,

128
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,640
we could measure their skull, calculate the volume of their brain,

129
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,120
or simply look at their facial features.

130
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Phrenology, however, has fallen out of favor with scientists of late,

131
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,920
although it should be noted the technology sector is currently in the process of reinventing it.

132
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,840
Now, I won't be going all that deeply into the history of intelligence testing today,

133
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,200
so I'll just start off here by saying that researchers eventually,

134
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,880
for the most part anyway, stopped measuring people's skulls

135
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,400
and started trying to measure what was going on inside them.

136
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,200
The first practical IQ test was invented by French psychologist Alfred Binet in 1905.

137
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,880
This test set out to determine the mental age of school children

138
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,840
and was designed with the purpose of identifying those children

139
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,160
who were underperforming compared to their peers so they could be given extra help.

140
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,040
Such noble beginnings here.

141
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,600
Now, Binet, for his part, stressed that intelligence was affected by environmental factors,

142
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
was not expressible as a singular fixed numerical value,

143
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,480
and was not exclusively genetic in origin.

144
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
His test was designed to identify those who were struggling in school

145
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
and not to rank people into some sort of eugenic hierarchy.

146
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,520
Binet died in 1911 and has since spent the majority of his time spinning in his grave

147
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,160
due to everything else we're going to talk about today.

148
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,280
An American psychologist called Henry H. Goddard

149
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,040
translated Binet's intelligence test into English in 1908

150
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,280
and distributed thousands of copies of the test across the United States.

151
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,680
And in 1916, another American psychologist named Louis Terman,

152
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,800
working for the Stanford Graduate School of Education,

153
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,760
revised the test into what we know today as the Stanford-Binet IQ test.

154
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,440
Both Goddard and Terman also worked together with other psychologists

155
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
to create the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests,

156
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,400
which were intelligence tests administered to US military recruits during World War I.

157
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,040
Before we go any further, I'd like to pause for a second

158
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,560
and propose a question about our intelligence tests here.

159
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,480
How do we know that they are actually measuring intelligence?

160
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
They're called intelligence tests, sure,

161
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,200
but that doesn't necessarily mean they are actually measuring intelligence, does it?

162
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,800
As we discussed earlier, intelligence is a very broad concept.

163
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,320
How do we know we're not merely measuring a tiny segment of it?

164
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,400
Well, in the early 20th century, English psychologist Charles Spearman

165
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,440
used a statistical technique called factor analysis

166
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,640
to identify what he called the G factor.

167
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,320
Spearman noticed that people's test results across a range of subjects

168
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,680
were positively correlated, and reasoned that this was because

169
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,480
of an underlying general intelligence factor, which he dubbed G.

170
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,120
And this G factor supposedly underlies all mental performance,

171
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,360
so no matter the subject being tested,

172
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,360
they are all influenced by this one general intelligence factor.

173
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
And psychometricians claim that IQ tests measure this G factor,

174
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,240
psychometricians being people concerned with psychological measurement there.

175
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,080
Now, G answers both of our difficult questions, if you'd noticed.

176
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,160
Thanks to the G factor, the vast range of potential human intelligence

177
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,040
is no longer a barrier to us testing for it,

178
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,960
because it's supposedly all linked to a single underlying factor

179
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,440
that is able to be measured and expressed as a single numerical value.

180
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,280
It's very handy, isn't it, this general intelligence factor?

181
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,440
Suspiciously handy, one might say,

182
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,760
but we'll talk more about G and Spearman's factor analysis later on.

183
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,400
Now, before we conclude our little history lesson here,

184
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,640
there is something else that must be noted,

185
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,560
and it's that early proponents of IQ testing in America and elsewhere

186
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,360
were not motivated solely by some neutral scientific curiosity.

187
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
They were eugenicists.

188
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,000
They wanted to use what they could learn from intelligence testing

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,840
as a way to improve the genetic quality of the human population

190
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,480
through what amounts to selective breeding.

191
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
Henry Goddard, who translated Binet's intelligence test,

192
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,400
proposed segregating the so-called feeble-minded into colonies

193
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,560
separate from the rest of society.

194
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,520
And Lewis Turman, author of the Stanford-Binet test,

195
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,720
wrote the following in a 1916 work called The Uses of Intelligence Tests.

196
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,840
Thus far, intelligence tests have found their chief application

197
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,600
in the identification and grading of the feeble-minded.

198
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,920
It is safe to predict that in the near future,

199
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,000
intelligence tests will bring tens of thousands of these high-grade defectives

200
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,080
under the surveillance of society.

201
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,560
This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness

202
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,840
and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime,

203
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,160
pauperism, and industrial inefficiency, end quote.

204
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,200
And tens of thousands of Americans were forcibly sterilized during the last century,

205
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,240
and low IQ test results were used to justify many of those sterilizations.

206
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,720
The eugenics movement lost a lot of momentum as a result of the Second World War,

207
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,680
during which eugenics became irrevocably associated

208
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,560
with many of the worst crimes of Nazi Germany.

209
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,840
And in the following decades,

210
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,800
many countries distanced themselves from eugenics policies,

211
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,280
and many scientists became more suspicious of not just eugenics itself,

212
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,760
but also the extent of the worth of intelligence testing as a concept.

213
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,920
Now, not to spoil the end of my video here,

214
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,400
but this is a good chunk of the reason that the reaction to the bell curve was so harsh.

215
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,040
The idea that we can use intelligence test results

216
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,920
in order to inform political policy was only half a lifetime before the book was written,

217
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,160
getting people sent to gas chambers.

218
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,000
So it's not surprising that people would be rather suspicious about it.

219
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,040
Let's just say that anyone attempting to resurrect this idea

220
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
needs to be incredibly aware of and respectful of

221
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
exactly where what they're proposing can lead.

222
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,840
So people are fleeing eugenics in droves

223
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,640
simply because it was used to justify an indefensible crime against humanity,

224
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:44,160
and scientists are increasingly skeptical of the extent of the usefulness of intelligence testing

225
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,200
and IQ and efforts to rank people according to biology in general.

226
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,080
And all this brings us to the bell curve.

227
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,240
The empire strikes back.

228
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,120
And in this book,

229
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,800
Herrnstein and Murray come to the defense of IQ and say now,

230
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
everyone calm down.

231
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,920
Don't throw the baby out with the bath water here.

232
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Intelligence testing and IQ are important and useful concepts,

233
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,320
and crucially, what we can learn from IQ testing should inform our politics

234
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,880
and be used to change our society.

235
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,440
So, you know, eugenics, but nice this time.

236
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,240
And since we've now arrived at the bell curve, I think it's time for us to read it.

237
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,200
Not all of it, right now, we'd be here all day,

238
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,360
but I will briefly summarize it here,

239
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,960
for the most part using the introductions that precede each chapter.

240
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,320
In the introduction to the book,

241
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,600
Herrnstein and Murray begin by talking about intelligence.

242
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,240
They offer Spearman's definition of intelligence as

243
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,520
a person's capacity for complex mental work,

244
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,680
and argue that general intelligence can be measured by IQ tests,

245
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,400
saying,

246
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,720
Furthermore, the classicists point out,

247
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,160
the best standardized tests, such as a modern IQ test,

248
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,200
do a reasonably good job of measuring IQ.

249
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,320
When properly administered, the tests are not measurably biased

250
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,520
against socioeconomic, ethnic, or racial subgroups.

251
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,520
They predict a wide variety of socially important outcomes.

252
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
They also defend the practice of IQ testing

253
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,640
from critics within the scientific community,

254
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,160
notably evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould,

255
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,600
whose 1981 book, The Mismeasure of Man, was,

256
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
quoting the back of my copy here,

257
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,760
immediately hailed as a masterwork,

258
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,800
the ringing answer to those who would classify people,

259
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,720
rank them according to their supposed genetic gifts and limits.

260
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,680
In this book, Gould is highly critical of everything from

261
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,200
phrenology and craniometry to modern IQ testing.

262
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
He argues against the concept of a single general intelligence,

263
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,400
and he highlights cases where eugenicists and psychometricians

264
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,560
had relied upon bad data and flawed statistical techniques,

265
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,800
including the case of Cyril Berth,

266
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,200
an early proponent of the use of twin studies

267
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,520
for examining the heritability of intelligence,

268
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,080
who, after he died, was revealed to have just been making up his research data.

269
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
That's one way to do it, I suppose.

270
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,680
The bell curve was written with the Mismeasure of Man in mind,

271
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,720
and is in some ways a response to its claims.

272
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,360
A newer edition of the Mismeasure of Man was printed

273
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,880
with an extra chapter responding to the claims of the bell curve,

274
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,200
and a newer edition of the bell curve was printed

275
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,120
with an extra chapter responding in part to Stephen Jay Gould.

276
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,040
Gould and Murray probably should have just met up and had a fight at this point.

277
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
On pages 22 and 23,

278
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,800
Hans-Nina Murray summarized their main claims about intelligence,

279
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,400
which are the following.

280
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,840
One, there is such a thing as a general factor of cognitive ability

281
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
on which human beings differ.

282
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,280
Two, all standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement

283
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,680
measure this general factor to some degree,

284
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,240
but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.

285
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,280
Three, IQ scores match, to a first degree,

286
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,680
whatever it is that people mean when they use the word

287
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,400
intelligent or smart in ordinary language.

288
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Four, IQ scores are stable,

289
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,160
although not perfectly so over much of a person's life.

290
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,680
Five, properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased

291
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,400
against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.

292
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,760
And six, cognitive ability is substantially heritable,

293
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,800
apparently no less than 40% and no more than 80%.

294
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,400
And on that last point,

295
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,880
Hans-Nina Murray later writes in a section titled

296
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,120
How Much Is IQ a Matter of Genes?

297
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
For purposes of this discussion,

298
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,120
we will adopt a middling estimate of 60% heritability,

299
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,960
which by extension means that IQ is about 40% a matter of environment.

300
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,680
So, on to part one of the bell curve,

301
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,720
which is titled The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite,

302
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,880
and introduces Hans-Nina Murray's theory

303
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,680
of the cognitive partitioning of society.

304
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,240
Since World War II, they argue,

305
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,560
colleges in the United States have increasingly admitted people by test score

306
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,400
rather than things like social standing or familial connections.

307
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,120
Where you could once expect to attend a prestigious college

308
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
if your father had gone there, for instance,

309
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
increasingly you now need to have competitive test scores.

310
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,480
This has led to high IQ people being found disproportionately

311
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,000
in the top institutions and geographically close together.

312
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,440
The job market is also increasingly IQ focused,

313
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,240
as low IQ jobs are replaced by automation,

314
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,360
and the best jobs have apparently become more selective of high IQ candidates.

315
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,680
IQ is also apparently a very good predictor of job performance.

316
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,120
These high IQ people,

317
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,280
economically and geographically segregated from the rest of society,

318
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,600
are increasingly partnering with each other,

319
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,640
and since we're assuming IQ is largely genetic,

320
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,360
are producing high IQ offspring.

321
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,120
Society is thus stratifying itself into some sort of intelligence-based caste system.

322
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,080
At the end of part one,

323
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,040
Hans-Nina Murray summarized their claims by saying,

324
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,840
One, the cognitive elite is getting richer in an era

325
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,640
when everyone else is having to struggle to stay even.

326
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Two, the cognitive elite is increasingly segregated physically from everyone else

327
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
in both the workplace and the neighborhood.

328
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,120
And three, the cognitive elite is increasingly likely to intermarry.

329
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,880
Part two of the bell curve is titled

330
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,280
Cognitive Classes and Social Behavior,

331
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,520
and here, Hans-Nina Murray make the case that

332
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,320
intelligence is tied to behavior and predictably determines various things,

333
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,160
such as the likelihood of being poor, a criminal, a high school dropout,

334
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,360
unemployed, an unwed mother, on welfare, and so on.

335
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,200
In order to argue this,

336
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Hans-Nina Murray first introduced the source of their data,

337
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,400
which is the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, or AFQT.

338
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,120
This test was taken as part of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.

339
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,320
The subjects of this survey were aged 14 to 22,

340
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,080
and were administered the Armed Forces Qualifying Test in 1980.

341
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,600
Researchers then interviewed the group over the following decade,

342
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,320
asking them various questions about themselves.

343
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,080
Hans-Nina Murray used the respondents' scores on the AFQT

344
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,400
to determine the IQ of each person,

345
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,920
and then used their later interview answers to calculate to what degree

346
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,600
a high IQ is correlated with positive life outcomes,

347
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,680
and to what degree a low IQ is correlated with negative outcomes.

348
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,000
Throughout the rest of this section of the bell curve,

349
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,640
Hans-Nina Murray go further than simply arguing

350
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,640
for the correlation between low IQ and those negative life outcomes.

351
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,960
They make the case that one's AFQT score correlates with them more strongly

352
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
than socioeconomic status does.

353
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,120
Hans-Nina Murray compare the AFQT scores of each respondent

354
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,240
against their calculation of the socioeconomic status of the respondent's parents.

355
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,600
So, as the book Inequality by Design puts it,

356
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
roughly in the bell curve statistical comparisons,

357
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,320
the parent's class represents nurture, and the AFQT score represents nature.

358
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,480
Looking at various negative life outcomes,

359
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,160
like being in poverty, being in jail, being unemployed, and so on,

360
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,880
Hans-Nina Murray repeatedly find that for the young respondents to the survey,

361
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,800
AFQT score and by proxy IQ score is a more accurate predictor of life outcomes

362
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,440
than a parent's socioeconomic status.

363
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,400
Hans-Nina Murray conclude this section by stating that

364
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,040
a smarter population is more likely to be

365
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,280
and more capable of being made into a civil citizenry.

366
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,560
Part three of the bell curve is titled The National Context

367
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,520
and is where things start getting especially controversial.

368
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,240
This is the section of the book where they discuss differences

369
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,000
in cognitive ability across designated racial groups.

370
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,520
They review published literature on differences in racial IQ scores

371
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,640
and find substantial differences between the various groups.

372
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,040
They discuss the ways in which tests can be biased,

373
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,440
culturally and otherwise, but ultimately conclude

374
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,120
that these group differences cannot be explained away by bias.

375
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,080
In chapter 15, Hans-Nina Murray talk about how they think

376
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,360
cognitive ability in the West is declining, stating,

377
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,560
Throughout the West, modernization has brought falling birth rates.

378
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,160
The rates fall faster for educated women than the uneducated.

379
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,440
Because education is so closely linked with cognitive ability,

380
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,160
this tends to produce a dysgenic effect

381
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,120
or a downward shift in the ability distribution.

382
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,320
Furthermore, education leads women to have their babies later,

383
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,160
which alone also produces additional dysgenic pressure.

384
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,640
Have you ever seen the movie Idiocracy?

385
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,800
Because this is just that, basically.

386
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,240
Lower IQ people have more children than higher IQ people,

387
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,160
so therefore average IQ scores are going down.

388
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,800
However, Hans-Nina Murray run into a problem here,

389
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,560
which is that IQ scores had been going up, not down,

390
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,760
in the decades prior to the publication of the bell curve.

391
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
This is known as the Flynn Effect,

392
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,440
named for intelligence researcher James R. Flynn, who documented it,

393
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,520
and we will talk more about the bell curve's attempt

394
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,000
to account for the Flynn Effect later on.

395
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,920
Part four of the bell curve is titled

396
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,120
Living Together and is Concerned with Social Policy.

397
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,640
This is where Hans-Nina Murray start proposing political solutions

398
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,240
to the various problems they outlined in the previous chapters.

399
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,960
They discuss, and ultimately brand as ineffective,

400
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,040
all contemporary attempts to help disadvantaged children succeed in life.

401
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,440
Things like better nutrition, better schooling, a better home environment,

402
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,320
all these things can possibly, temporarily make people smarter, to a degree.

403
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
But in the end, Hans-Nina Murray conclude that they will all eventually

404
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,760
run into a genetic limit that cannot be worked around.

405
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Far more money is spent in ineffective attempts to help the disadvantaged

406
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,720
than is spent on the gifted, Hans-Nina Murray contend,

407
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,400
and we should thus directly shift the resources upwards

408
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,560
to support our best and brightest.

409
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,680
And this quote is from the introduction to Chapter 18.

410
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Some federal funds now so exclusively focused on the disadvantaged

411
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,640
should be reallocated to programs for the gifted.

412
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,880
Affirmative action in schools, as it stands, should be scrapped, of course.

413
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,240
Hans-Nina Murray argue for a sort of race-blind, score-based affirmative action.

414
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,560
They still support colleges accepting applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds,

415
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,400
but only if they have comparable test scores to the other applicants.

416
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,360
Affirmative action in the job market should also be scrapped,

417
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,640
with Hans-Nina Murray arguing that in pursuit of equality,

418
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
we have actually already overshot it,

419
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,600
and that black people actually attain better quality jobs than white people,

420
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,480
once you account for their IQs, of course.

421
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,840
Hans-Nina Murray argue for encouraging low IQ parents

422
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,560
to have fewer children in a couple of different ways.

423
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,360
Firstly, they argue for making marriage a prerequisite for parental rights,

424
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,960
and they also support cutting off welfare for low-income mothers,

425
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
stating that we urge generally that these policies,

426
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,520
represented by the extensive network of cash and services

427
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,440
for low-income women who have babies, be ended.

428
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,960
They also argue more generally in favor of individualism,

429
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,200
concluding Chapter 21 by writing,

430
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,240
Individualism is not only America's heritage, it must be its future.

431
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,520
Hans-Nina Murray conclude this part of the bell curve with the following.

432
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,840
Inequality of endowments, including intelligence, is a reality.

433
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,160
Trying to pretend that inequality does not really exist has led to disaster.

434
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,600
Trying to eradicate inequality with artificially manufactured outcomes has led to disaster.

435
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,880
It is time for America to once again try living with inequality as life is lived,

436
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,040
understanding that each human being has strengths and weaknesses and so on.

437
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,080
This is the end of the main text of the bell curve.

438
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,360
Then follows seven appendices explaining various things,

439
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,520
about the data and statistical methods used in the book, among other things.

440
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,760
Additionally, newer versions of the bell curve contain an afterword written in response

441
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,240
to various criticisms directed at the book by various scientists and journalists,

442
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,280
and we will be quoting from that at several points later on.

443
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,000
So then, that was the bell curve.

444
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,640
And before we carry on here, I think it would be worthwhile

445
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,160
to attempt to summarize the general argument of the book.

446
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,920
So here is my understanding of it in four points.

447
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,360
One, general intelligence, or G, exists.

448
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,800
General intelligence is to some degree heritable, innate,

449
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,560
unable to be significantly changed and unevenly distributed,

450
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,120
both within and across population groups.

451
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,840
Two, IQ tests measure G fairly and accurately.

452
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,480
Three, one's IQ is more important than one's social background

453
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,720
in determining one's life outcomes.

454
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,560
And four, given what we can learn from these points,

455
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,360
we should implement conservative social policies,

456
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,800
such as limiting welfare, incentivizing marriage,

457
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,360
abandoning affirmative action, and more broadly,

458
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,840
we should promote a return to a more individualistic society.

459
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,280
Now, I'm sure someone could disagree with the conservative adjective

460
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,600
in this last point and argue that Herrnstein and Murray

461
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,520
merely promote whatever policies seem to best address the problems they discuss.

462
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,960
They propose better access to birth control, for instance,

463
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,840
which is not typically a conservative policy.

464
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,320
Overall, though, their policy recommendations

465
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,960
definitely lean heavily to the right.

466
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,400
So it's now time to begin looking at the counter arguments,

467
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,880
and we will begin with point one on this list

468
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,520
and talk about general intelligence.

469
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,160
So if we want to understand general intelligence,

470
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,720
we first need to understand the statistical technique

471
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,400
by which it is calculated, factor analysis.

472
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,720
And if we want to understand factor analysis,

473
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,320
we first need to talk about correlation and causation.

474
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,400
Starting with correlation, then.

475
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,720
Correlation is basically statistical association.

476
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,040
Stephen Jay Gould in The Mismeasure of Man

477
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,720
describes it in the following way.

478
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,160
Correlation assesses the tendency of one measure

479
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,400
to vary in concert with another.

480
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,560
As a child grows, for example, both its arms and legs get longer.

481
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,840
This joint tendency to change in the same direction

482
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,680
is called a positive correlation.

483
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,880
Not all parts of the body display such positive correlation during growth.

484
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,160
Teeth, for example, do not grow after they erupt.

485
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,520
The relationship between first incisor length and leg length

486
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,000
from, say, age 10 to adulthood would represent zero correlation.

487
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,520
Legs would get longer while teeth changed not at all.

488
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,680
Other correlations can be negative.

489
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,640
One measure increases while the other decreases.

490
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,760
We begin to lose neurons at a distressingly early age

491
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,360
and they are not replaced.

492
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,480
Thus, the relationship between leg length and number of neurons

493
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,920
after mid-childhood represents negative correlation.

494
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,520
Leg length increases while number of neurons decreases.

495
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,240
And Gould also includes this handy illustration

496
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,880
of some example correlation graphs here.

497
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,800
Now, of course, leg length and arm length are positively correlated

498
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,200
because they share an underlying cause,

499
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
which is simply general biological growth.

500
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,240
However, we can think of plenty of things

501
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,680
that are positively correlated and do not share a cause.

502
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,080
You might be familiar with the following examples

503
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,920
from the page Spurious Correlations, which I will link below.

504
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,840
Per capita cheese consumption correlates with number of people who died

505
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,920
by becoming tangled in their bedsheets.

506
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,240
Number of letters in winning word of Scripps National Spelling Bee

507
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,960
correlates with number of people killed by venomous spiders, and so on.

508
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,600
Obviously, these things have nothing to do with each other.

509
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,120
Probably.

510
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,520
So some correlations are just chance.

511
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,880
It would be an error to assume a shared cause there.

512
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,960
Correlation does not imply causation, is the saying.

513
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,040
Now, in addition to assuming a shared cause when there is not one,

514
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,600
another common mistake here is to ignore a shared cause when there is one.

515
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,240
For example, when considering arm and leg length

516
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,960
to ignore the underlying biological growth

517
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,600
and assume that legs are getting longer because arms are, or vice versa.

518
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,600
There are lots of different ways to misrepresent correlations, basically.

519
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,800
I agree with Gould when he writes the invalid assumption that correlation implies cause

520
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,240
is probably among the two or three most serious and common errors of human reasoning.

521
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,800
Anyway, one result of us calculating the correlation between arm and leg lengths

522
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,920
is that we have simplified the data somewhat.

523
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:07,520
The strong correlation between the two variables means we can basically express them as one,

524
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,520
so long as we don't mind losing a little information along the way.

525
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,000
But what if instead of just two variables,

526
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,680
we wanted to compare correlations between the size of, say, 50 different body parts?

527
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,200
Plotting two measurements in a graph is fairly easy.

528
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,680
With the addition of a third measurement, though, things start getting a little trickier.

529
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,320
This figure from the Mismeasure of Man, where Gould introduces head measurements into the mix,

530
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,320
needs another dimension in order to convey the information.

531
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,320
And with more variables added in, the data quickly gets too complex

532
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,040
to display with a mere three dimensions.

533
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,760
And this brings us to factor analysis.

534
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,680
Similar to how we simplified arm and leg length to a single dimension,

535
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,440
factor analysis can be used to reduce a complex system of correlated variables

536
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,880
to a smaller number of underlying factors.

537
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,360
And you might find that just a few underlying factors explain the vast majority of the

538
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,480
variations in a larger number of variables.

539
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,440
And furthermore, you could identify which factor explained the majority of the variation.

540
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,760
I won't be going into the exact specifics of how factor analysis works.

541
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,040
I couldn't if I wanted to, to be honest, but this is basically how it is used.

542
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,240
To quote Gould again,

543
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,680
factor analysis is a mathematical technique for reducing a complex system of correlations

544
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,280
into fewer dimensions.

545
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,080
So you might be wondering, what does all this have to do with intelligence?

546
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,160
Well, factor analysis is how psychologist Charles Spearman came up with the concept of the G factor.

547
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,600
Spearman looked at a big mass of data showing that people scores on various intelligence tests

548
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,760
were positively correlated, carried out a little factor analysis,

549
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,920
and identified the most important underlying statistical factor.

550
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,360
He then called this G, or general intelligence.

551
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:03,840
So this G is the underlying general mental ability that we are supposedly measuring with IQ tests.

552
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,440
However, there are a few problems with this G factor.

553
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,000
One is, as the bell curve itself points out,

554
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,800
that it's based on statistical analysis rather than direct observation.

555
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,000
We are inferring its existence from the data rather than measuring it directly, basically.

556
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,280
It is the result of a particular statistical method.

557
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Secondly, simplifying the majority of the data down to a single factor

558
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,200
can actually obscure a lot of useful information.

559
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,760
What if the data shows that people who do well on tests of numerical ability

560
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,280
tend to do well on other tests of numerical ability,

561
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,320
and people who do well on tests of their language ability

562
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,000
tend to do better on other tests of language ability?

563
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,120
We can imagine two people who are determined to be statistically as smart as each other,

564
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,880
but who excel in completely different areas, right?

565
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,600
And there are several different intelligence theories

566
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,720
identifying different clusters of mental abilities.

567
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Verbal, logical, spatial, mathematical, whatever else.

568
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,000
You can go and read about all of those if you're very bored.

569
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,720
But what can we take away from our little chat about correlation and factor analysis here?

570
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,680
Well, first of all, factor analysis tells us nothing about causation.

571
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,840
It deals with correlations.

572
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,240
It can show that there might be common factors underlying different variables,

573
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,240
but it does not identify for us why those variables vary.

574
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,360
As a comparison here, let's say you take a sample of 10,000 random members of the public

575
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,360
and you test their athletic performance at various physical tests.

576
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,240
Amount of weight lifted, length jumped, speed at running various distances,

577
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,000
sit-ups completed, whatever.

578
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,840
And let's say that what you find is that people who perform well on one test relative to the group

579
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,360
tend to perform well on the other tests relative to the group

580
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,760
and vice versa for those who perform poorly.

581
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,560
Now you could, if you so fancied, subject this data to factor analysis.

582
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,280
Identify numerically the most important underlying factor and name it F

583
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,600
for general fitness or something.

584
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,560
And you could probably further assign each person an FQ or fitness quotient.

585
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,240
However, what you would not have done is explain why some people are fitter than others.

586
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,080
You would have said nothing about the heritability of athletic performance,

587
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,480
the degree to which genetics and environment contribute to athletic performance.

588
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,320
You'd have said nothing about the causes of the data at all.

589
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,520
It would be a leap of logic to assume that each person's FQ is innate and unchangeable.

590
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,440
The data you have cannot tell you any such thing by itself.

591
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,280
You may also find that your singular numerical fitness quotient

592
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,760
obscures a lot of useful information.

593
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,520
For instance, you might find people who are better at strength exercises

594
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,800
tend to be better at other strength exercises and so on.

595
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,320
So the mere existence of a general factor of cognitive ability

596
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,600
would not explain why there are differences between people.

597
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,280
In fact, the G factor is perfectly consistent

598
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,000
with a 100% environmental approach to understanding intelligence.

599
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,240
We could play devil's advocate here and say,

600
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,480
yes, a general factor of intelligence exists and is important,

601
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,320
but the variance in G between people is explained entirely by environmental factors.

602
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,360
Childhood nutrition, socioeconomic status, school quality, and so on.

603
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,640
Absolutely nothing happens in the factor analysis process

604
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,240
to tell us about what the causes are for people having different measurable levels of intelligence.

605
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,240
And even if we accept a single general intelligence factor exists,

606
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,400
that would not necessarily imply a genetic causation.

607
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,960
And speaking of genetics, let's next talk about the word heritability.

608
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,960
When the bell curve says,

609
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,760
cognitive ability is substantially heritable,

610
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,800
apparently no less than 40% and no more than 80%,

611
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,360
what does that mean exactly?

612
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,320
If we average it for 60%, like they do,

613
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,920
are we therefore to assume that each person's individual IQ

614
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,200
is 60% determined by heritable genetics and 40% by the environment?

615
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
Well, no.

616
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,960
Heritability is unfortunately one of those awkward words

617
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,200
which has a common use understanding and a scientific understanding

618
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,840
which differ in a few important ways.

619
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,240
The common use understanding is something like

620
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,160
the ability of a thing to be passed down genetically, right?

621
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,360
You can inherit being tall or having red hair,

622
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,240
but you can't inherit a scar or a finger lost in an accident, say.

623
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,320
The technical academic meaning of heritability is rather different.

624
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,760
Heritability is a numerical concept used to estimate

625
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,440
the contribution of genetic variance to overall variance of a trait within a group.

626
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,720
So basically, heritability estimates the degree to which

627
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,440
the variance of a trait within a group is due to genetics.

628
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,160
Height is thus a heritable trait.

629
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,680
Taller parents will generally have taller offspring, for example,

630
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,560
and this is measurable against a population group.

631
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,680
Having two arms, however, is not a heritable trait

632
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,720
because almost everyone has two arms.

633
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,960
And for people who don't have two arms,

634
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,400
that variance is usually environmental in nature.

635
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,520
Having two arms is genetically determined,

636
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,320
but it is not a heritable trait if you follow

637
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,440
because genes account for very little of the variance

638
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,360
within the population group.

639
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,520
Something that is very highly heritable,

640
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,320
we would say has a heritability of one.

641
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Something that is not heritable at all,

642
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,720
we would say has a heritability of zero.

643
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,640
If we say something has a heritability of 0.6,

644
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,960
then what we mean there is that 60% of the variance of the trait

645
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,720
in a population group will be due to genetic factors.

646
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,760
What it does not mean is that 60% of the trait in one individual

647
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,000
is due to their genes and 40% due to the environment.

648
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,440
Heritability tells us about variance within a group,

649
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,480
not the makeup of individuals.

650
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,560
It is a population statistic.

651
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,040
You cannot meaningfully ask what the heritability of your IQ is.

652
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,400
So where am I going with this?

653
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,040
Well, there's a couple of points that I'd like to make.

654
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,640
The first is that a trait can be determined by your genes

655
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,880
and be very lowly heritable, such as the presence of arms,

656
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,560
and also the inverse of that.

657
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,120
A trait could be very highly heritable

658
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,240
and not directly genetically determined.

659
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,600
One common example used to illustrate this is earrings.

660
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,400
What would we say accounts for the variance

661
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,520
in whether people wear earrings within a particular group?

662
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
Well, depending on the group,

663
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,040
most of the variance could be due, in one sense,

664
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,160
to a genetic factor, biological sex.

665
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,920
Wearing earrings would therefore be a heritable trait,

666
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,720
but this does not mean that there is an earring gene

667
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,040
that is being passed down generationally.

668
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,920
The majority of people wearing earrings being women

669
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,160
would be due to environmental factors, fashion and gender roles,

670
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,240
which are subject to change over time.

671
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,560
In more recent years, for example,

672
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,840
men in the West have increasingly been wearing earrings.

673
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,480
The heritability of the trait of wearing earrings is thus decreasing,

674
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,480
because less of the variance is being accounted for by genetics.

675
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,680
But crucially here,

676
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,000
nothing is actually happening genetically on the earring front.

677
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,720
The change in heritability is down to changing environmental factors.

678
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,360
When we say something is due to genetics,

679
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,720
we need to be very careful about exactly what we mean.

680
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,960
A useful categorization here is

681
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,720
direct versus indirect genetic determination.

682
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,280
We need to be sure to differentiate between things

683
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,160
that are directly genetically determined,

684
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,160
as in your genes are directly causing some biochemical process

685
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,440
to happen within you,

686
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,400
and things that are indirectly genetically determined,

687
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,320
as a result of your genes interacting with your environment.

688
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,960
Women being more likely to wear earrings, for instance,

689
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,640
is a heritable trait,

690
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,000
but it is not directly genetically determined.

691
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,840
This is relevant to us because IQ could be such a trait,

692
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,960
where differences in IQ across designated racial groups

693
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,240
are caused not by a direct genetic process,

694
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,840
but instead by how our genetically determined characteristics

695
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,000
interact with our environment,

696
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,520
so as to affect our results on IQ tests.

697
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,240
For example,

698
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,320
let's imagine your genes cause you to have a particular skin color,

699
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,560
and you live in a segregated society

700
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,920
in which people with that skin color are discriminated against

701
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,560
and do not have equal access to education.

702
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,760
Now that group's lower results on IQ tests

703
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,960
would be, in one sense, because of their genes.

704
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,200
And scientists studying genetics

705
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,520
might very well find a strong correlation

706
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,520
between particular genes and lowered IQ test results,

707
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,800
but if we don't take the environment into account,

708
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,440
that by itself can't tell us anything.

709
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,720
The point here is that a trait could be very highly heritable

710
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,360
and correlated strongly with particular genes

711
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,040
and still have zero direct genetic determination.

712
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
Now the idea that wearing earrings

713
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,080
can be more of a heritable trait than having ears

714
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,520
is admittedly a bit of a difficult concept to grasp at first sight,

715
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,600
and I would understand if it took a little time

716
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,920
for someone to wrap their head around all this.

717
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,720
Right now, though, what I want you to take away from this section,

718
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,600
if nothing else,

719
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,400
is the idea that something being heritable

720
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,680
does not necessarily mean it is actually being directly caused by genetics.

721
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,840
My next point is that heritability estimates the causes of variants

722
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,960
within a group.

723
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,000
It cannot tell us about reasons for differences across groups.

724
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,040
And to illustrate this,

725
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,360
we will paraphrase a thought experiment by geneticist Richard Lewontin.

726
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,360
Let's say we take a packet of seeds

727
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,520
and plant them in fertilized soil in a controlled laboratory environment,

728
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,000
and we ensure that the growing plants have sufficient

729
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,800
and equal amounts of water and light.

730
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
And doesn't that sound nice?

731
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,040
Now height in plants is a heritable trait, just like in humans,

732
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,720
and the plants would thus grow to a range of different heights.

733
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,560
Height in this experiment would be very highly heritable,

734
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,400
because the fact we're ensuring the plants have an equal environment

735
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,200
means that the variance in heights in the group

736
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,440
is solely down to genetics.

737
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,920
Next, let's say we do that experiment again,

738
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,560
only this time we plant the seeds in bad soil

739
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,440
and give them less but equal within the group amounts of water and light.

740
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,440
The thing to understand here is that height in this second experiment

741
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,440
would be exactly as heritable as in the previous experiment.

742
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,240
All of the plants from the second group have the same group environment,

743
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,960
meaning that, again, the group variance in heights

744
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,360
would be solely down to genetics.

745
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,480
The poor environment will produce smaller plants,

746
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,160
but since they are all subject to that environment equally,

747
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,240
heritability remains high.

748
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,400
The problems arise when we start trying to compare these two groups.

749
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,200
Let's say the second group of plants has an average height

750
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,880
that is 15% shorter than the first group, for instance.

751
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,200
The heritability of height tells us nothing about why that is.

752
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,240
Heritability was the same across both groups.

753
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,320
If you're trying to figure out why one group of plants grew larger than the other,

754
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,400
saying height is heritable tells us nothing useful.

755
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,720
The difference between the groups was entirely down to environmental factors,

756
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,040
and heritability, despite being high, played no part.

757
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,920
The two points we can take from this thought experiment are,

758
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,560
firstly, the heritability of traits does not account for group differences,

759
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,160
and secondly, a trait having a high heritability

760
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,120
does not mean that trait is immutable or unaffected by the environment.

761
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,520
For another example of this, height in humans is a highly heritable trait,

762
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,360
but the average human height increased substantially over the last century,

763
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,680
and this was due to environmental changes,

764
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,160
such as better health care and nutrition.

765
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,600
Or for another example,

766
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,080
North Koreans are, on average, a few inches shorter than South Koreans,

767
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,480
and this is down to the different material conditions in those two countries,

768
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,000
not some recent radical divergence in genetics.

769
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,960
Height is heritable in both North and South Korea,

770
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,280
but it's the environment that is the cause of the variance between the groups.

771
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,120
This is something that the bell curve crucially misunderstands

772
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,120
when talking about the heritability of intelligence and IQ.

773
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,880
On page 109, they say,

774
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,200
even a heritability of 0.6 leaves room for considerable change

775
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,720
if the changes in environments are commensurably large,

776
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,680
the implication here being that higher heritabilities

777
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,960
would be less affected by changes in the environment,

778
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,200
and this is just not how it works.

779
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,440
IQ could be 100% heritable

780
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,720
and still massively affected by changes in the group environment.

781
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,680
Professor Ned Block from New York University

782
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,160
makes several of these points about heritability

783
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,320
in an article entitled How Heritability Misleads About Race,

784
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,520
and then goes on to say,

785
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,120
I hope these points remove the temptation exhibited in the bell curve

786
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,840
to think of the heritability of IQ as a constant, like the speed of light.

787
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,400
Heritability is a population statistic,

788
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,640
just like birth rate or number of TVs,

789
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,160
and can be expected to change with changing circumstances.

790
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,920
These issues are pathetically misunderstood by Charles Murray.

791
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,960
In a CNN interview reported in the New Republic,

792
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,000
Murray declared,

793
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,600
when I, when we, say 60% heritability,

794
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,080
it's not 60% of the variation,

795
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,080
it is 60% of the IQ in any given person.

796
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,720
Later, he repeated that for the average person,

797
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,320
60% of the intelligence comes from heredity,

798
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,520
and added that this was true of the human species,

799
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,040
missing the point that heritability makes no sense for an individual

800
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,480
and that heritability statistics are population relative.

801
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,600
So if you don't quite understand all this stuff about heritability,

802
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,840
don't feel too bad because Charles Murray doesn't understand it either.

803
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,240
Or at least he didn't 25 years ago,

804
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,960
he may have done his homework since then, who knows.

805
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,320
Looking again at the bell curve's list of claims about intelligence,

806
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,760
the only one on here that could be said to be making a point about genetics is number six.

807
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,040
Cognitive ability is substantially heritable.

808
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,240
However, as we've seen,

809
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,360
a trait being heritable does not necessarily mean a direct genetic cause.

810
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,400
It does not tell us anything about the heritability of a particular individual's intelligence,

811
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,880
and it cannot tell us the reason for differences between groups of people.

812
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,200
Those differences between people could be caused by environmental factors,

813
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,520
because, twist, environments are heritable too.

814
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,680
As the bell curve itself points out,

815
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,520
non-genetic characteristics can nonetheless run in families.

816
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,440
For practical purposes, environments are heritable too.

817
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,680
So to summarize this section,

818
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,080
we have considered the method by which a general intelligence factor is determined,

819
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,800
and also claims about its heritability.

820
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,200
But we can conclude from neither of these things

821
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,640
that the variance in intelligence between groups of people has a direct genetic cause.

822
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,920
The cause could simply be directly due to the environment,

823
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,160
or indirectly by way of how genes are interacting with that environment.

824
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,960
So why am I listing off all the ways in which

825
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,400
Hanstein and Murray do not prove a genetic cause for cognitive ability, you might ask.

826
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,680
Their later comparisons of IQ and environmental factors

827
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,040
assume that IQ is largely genetic in origin,

828
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,640
so presumably they do prove it at some point, right?

829
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,040
Well, to put it bluntly, no.

830
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,160
In their section, How Much Is IQ a Matter of Genes?,

831
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,720
they estimate the heritability of IQ scores by talking about twin studies.

832
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,400
We can use studies of identical twins, non-identical twins, and regular siblings

833
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,600
to estimate the extent of genetic effects upon IQ

834
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:13,120
by noting the differences in correlations between their scores on intelligence tests.

835
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,520
However, there are a few problems with this.

836
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,800
Most importantly for us here being that in attempting to learn about

837
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,560
genetic cognitive ability via intelligence test scores,

838
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,280
we have to make the assumption that intelligence tests

839
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,320
are an accurate measure of cognitive ability.

840
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,240
But more on that in a moment.

841
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,360
Even if we assume that the tests do give an accurate representation of cognitive ability,

842
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:40,400
attempts to use these correlations to construct a simple genetic model for IQ

843
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,920
run into several issues.

844
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,560
Firstly, the IQs of identical twins do not perfectly correlate,

845
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,400
as we would expect them to, given their nearly identical genetics.

846
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,280
The correlation of siblings who were raised apart is weaker

847
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,240
than the correlation of siblings who were raised together.

848
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,080
And probably most troublesome for a purely genetic model here

849
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,280
is that there is also some correlation between parents and adopted children.

850
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,360
Their scores correlate to some degree,

851
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:13,120
despite there being no immediate genetic link beyond being the same species, of course.

852
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,440
So in our search for exactly how much genetics affects cognitive ability,

853
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,960
these observations are only ever going to get us so far.

854
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,320
It's very difficult to disentangle the genetic effects from the environmental ones.

855
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,080
What we really need here is genetics research to advance to the point

856
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,680
where we understand exactly which genes influence intelligence

857
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,080
and to which degree they influence intelligence.

858
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,920
When the bell curve was published, the evidence was not there.

859
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,760
As Herndstein and Murray admit,

860
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,360
the state of knowledge does not permit a precise estimate.

861
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,240
And in 2019, 25 years later, the evidence is still not there.

862
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,960
If anything, with regards to the claims in the bell curve,

863
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,760
particularly its claims about racial differences,

864
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,040
the genetic story has only gotten more complicated.

865
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,240
The reason I say designated racial groups instead of racial groups during this video

866
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,000
is because on a genetic level,

867
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,560
our skin color folk understanding of racial groups can be unhelpful.

868
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,720
There can be greater genetic differences

869
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,480
within our socially constructed racial groups than between them.

870
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,960
I doubt anyone would be so naive as to expect us to one day identify

871
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,440
the singular gene that controls both skin color and intelligence.

872
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,200
Someone having dark skin and thus being identified and identifying as black

873
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,840
could have a whole range of genetic history.

874
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,840
You can't read someone's genes by looking at their skin color.

875
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,120
This is important for us because the authors of the bell curve

876
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,720
use our socially constructed racial groups in their book.

877
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,480
Talking about this, they say,

878
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,760
what does it mean to be black in America in racial terms

879
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,720
when the word black or African-American can be used

880
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,400
for people whose ancestry is more European than African?

881
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,680
How are we to classify a person whose parents hail from Panama

882
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,480
but whose ancestry is predominantly African?

883
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
Is he a Latino, a black?

884
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,160
The rule we follow here is to classify people

885
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,600
according to the way they classify themselves.

886
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,200
It would be a leap of logic to assume genetic explanations

887
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,640
for characteristics of self-identified groups,

888
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,560
given that those groups could have a wide range of genetic makeups.

889
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,600
My point with all this is that the bell curve's direct evidence

890
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,880
of a genetic basis for IQ is missing.

891
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,360
Charles Murray's attitude towards this problem

892
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,760
in the years since the publication of the book

893
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,160
has been to kick the can down the road,

894
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,840
assuming that he and Herrnstein were prematurely right,

895
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,880
to borrow a phrase from his afterword to the bell curve,

896
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,880
and that the accumulating genetic evidence will prove him right

897
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,760
if everyone just waits a little longer.

898
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,120
And it remains his tactic more than two decades later.

899
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,920
In October of this year, Professor Ewan Birney,

900
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,200
the director of the European Bioinformatics Institute,

901
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,960
published a blog post titled

902
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,240
Race, Genetics and Pseudoscience, an explainer,

903
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,000
which discusses, among other things,

904
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,480
how our traditional racial categorizations

905
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,160
are not reflected in actual patterns of genetic variation,

906
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,160
how distinct groups within Africa can be as distinct from each other

907
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,080
as they are with non-Africans,

908
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,240
how race is not a useful or accurate term for geneticists,

909
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,520
and it says that it is often suggested that geneticists

910
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,400
who emphasize the biological invalidity of race

911
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,200
are under the form of political correctness,

912
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,360
forced to suppress their real opinions

913
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,560
in order to maintain their positions in the academy.

914
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,800
Such accusations are unfounded

915
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,560
and betray a lack of understanding of what motivates science.

916
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,080
Charles Murray responded to this post on Twitter a few days later,

917
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,640
saying,

918
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,000
I can't understand why people are so eager to go public

919
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,440
with positions for which the weight of the accumulating evidence

920
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,800
is so unwelcome

921
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,640
and that will be definitively settled within a few years.

922
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,680
So it seems the evidence for Murray is still just a few years away.

923
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,840
With regards to the bell curve, however,

924
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,480
it is possible we are being a little unfair

925
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,440
when we criticize it for basing much of its analysis

926
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,520
on relatively crude estimations.

927
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,800
After all, they do admit the evidence is not there,

928
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,520
and they say,

929
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,600
if the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation

930
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,760
has won out to the exclusion of the other,

931
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,600
we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other.

932
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,040
We should not criticize scientists for saying,

933
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,480
the evidence isn't there yet, but here's a rough guess.

934
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,520
Presenting such estimates and attempting to disprove them

935
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,840
is a key part of the scientific process.

936
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,720
Problems arise when we get to part four of the bell curve, however.

937
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,320
While it is fine to say,

938
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,520
the evidence isn't there yet, but here's a rough guess,

939
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,280
it is not so fine to say,

940
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,120
the evidence isn't there yet,

941
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,560
here's a rough guess.

942
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,320
And based upon this rough guess,

943
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,280
you should immediately suspend welfare programs

944
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,440
for underprivileged children.

945
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,120
But we'll talk more about this later

946
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,600
when we discuss the politics of the bell curve.

947
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,400
For now, though, let's address the assumption I mentioned earlier

948
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,240
when talking about twin studies.

949
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,760
We have been in this section

950
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,440
assuming that we can measure native intelligence accurately.

951
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,920
If we cannot measure native intelligence accurately,

952
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,040
then much of what we've talked about thus far is irrelevant.

953
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,400
So it's now time to talk about IQ tests.

954
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,000
So I summarized the bell curve's claims about IQ tests

955
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,160
as IQ tests measure G fairly and accurately.

956
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,400
I wrote fairly because of their statement,

957
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,680
properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased

958
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,720
against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.

959
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,520
And I wrote the word accurately because of their statement

960
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,880
that all standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement

961
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,200
measure this general factor to some degree,

962
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,560
but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose

963
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,640
measure it most accurately.

964
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,480
So firstly here, we're going to discuss

965
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,600
a few of the possible problems with IQ tests,

966
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,200
starting with the various ways

967
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,840
in which they can deliver biased results.

968
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,120
Now, direct cultural bias in IQ test items

969
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,400
is discussed by Herrnstein and Murray in chapter 13.

970
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,920
They use an example of a question that includes the word regata,

971
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,160
which is a word that might bias the results

972
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,280
towards certain cultural and economic groups.

973
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,880
And certain historical so-called intelligence test questions

974
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,720
have actually been much worse than this.

975
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,040
Some of them amounted to nothing more than general knowledge questions.

976
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,600
The army alpha test used in World War I

977
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,440
asked army recruits to identify

978
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,320
what particular celebrities were famous for,

979
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,440
in which cities certain cars were manufactured,

980
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,320
and the products produced by certain brands.

981
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,120
Questions like these obviously have very little to do

982
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,280
with any native intellectual ability,

983
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,800
they're just testing whether or not

984
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,760
you happen to already know the answer.

985
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,160
There's no opportunity to work it out,

986
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,600
so any psychometricians constructing intelligence tests

987
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,880
certainly need to be careful

988
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,400
to not include biased test items like these ones.

989
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,360
Tests can also be biased for instruction.

990
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,440
And what do we mean by instruction here?

991
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,680
Well, simply whether or not you've been taught

992
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,800
the meaning of a word

993
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,520
or the best method for solving a maths problem

994
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,200
is going to matter a lot on a test

995
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,680
that requires you to draw upon your mathematical

996
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,200
and language abilities.

997
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,480
As an example here,

998
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,400
I'm gonna assume that we all agree

999
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,120
it would be unfair to expect a random teenager

1000
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,840
to, by themselves, during a test,

1001
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,760
invent trigonometry.

1002
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,920
If you include trigonometry questions

1003
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,520
on your intelligence test,

1004
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,880
what you'll be testing for there

1005
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,760
will not solely be the intelligence of the respondent,

1006
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,680
but also whether or not they've been taught

1007
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,280
trigonometry before,

1008
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,200
how recently they were taught it,

1009
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,360
and how well they were taught it.

1010
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,880
This is relevant for us here

1011
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,200
because the Armed Forces Qualifying Test,

1012
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,240
which is the primary source of intelligence test data

1013
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,280
in the bell curve,

1014
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,040
had as one of its four sections

1015
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,440
a mathematics test which included questions

1016
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,120
examining knowledge of classroom trigonometry and algebra.

1017
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,000
This is more of a test of scholastic aptitude

1018
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,520
than native intelligence,

1019
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,280
and is also testing by proxy

1020
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,080
the quality of the teaching at the different schools

1021
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,240
that the AFQT respondents went to.

1022
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,480
We can't assume that to be equal

1023
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,960
across thousands of different people, can we?

1024
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,440
This is one of a few problems with the AFQT

1025
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,720
that has roots in the fact

1026
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,280
that it was not designed as an IQ test,

1027
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,120
but more on that in a second.

1028
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,640
Another way that IQ tests can be biased is for speed.

1029
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,720
Think of the definitions of intelligence

1030
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,840
we've seen so far.

1031
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,120
A capacity for complex mental work,

1032
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,440
catching on, making sense of things,

1033
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,440
and figuring out what to do.

1034
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,680
And simply because of the way IQ tests

1035
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,480
are administered,

1036
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,920
we have to add the words

1037
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,800
within the time constraints of an academic test

1038
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,320
to all of those things.

1039
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,160
IQ tests are by their nature

1040
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,480
biased towards how fast you can think

1041
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,560
and away from other important qualities

1042
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,280
which contribute to overall cognitive ability

1043
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,720
such as stamina, determination, and discipline.

1044
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,760
Similar to that point,

1045
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,920
IQ tests have a more general bias

1046
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,280
towards familiarity with an academic environment.

1047
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,440
People unfamiliar with taking tests

1048
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,720
are going to fare worse

1049
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,560
than people who are very used to it

1050
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,600
simply due to being in an unfamiliar environment.

1051
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,760
Things like anxiety and stress

1052
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,040
come into play here.

1053
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,120
Those can affect intelligence test results

1054
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,800
despite having nothing directly

1055
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,960
to do with intelligence themselves.

1056
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,000
Herrnstein and Murray

1057
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,480
are particularly aware of that last point,

1058
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,760
and we need to briefly discuss

1059
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,280
the Flynn effect here.

1060
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,360
So when IQ tests are constructed,

1061
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,560
they're standardized using a sample of test takers.

1062
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,000
Now what that means in practice

1063
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,080
is the testers will test some people,

1064
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,760
work out the average score,

1065
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,560
and set that to correspond to 100.

1066
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,800
This is why we recognize an IQ of 100 as the average.

1067
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,040
When those IQ tests are later revised

1068
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,360
or when new IQ tests are designed,

1069
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,840
they're also standardized on new groups of people

1070
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,640
and their average is set again to 100.

1071
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,720
However, researchers noticed

1072
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,160
that when newer test subjects

1073
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,400
take the older versions of a test,

1074
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,520
their IQ scores are on average higher.

1075
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,640
So IQ scores have gone up over time, basically,

1076
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,160
meaning if you believe that IQ tests measure intelligence,

1077
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,440
then people must be getting more intelligent, right?

1078
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,440
This is troublesome for Herrnstein and Murray

1079
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,120
because they argue the opposite,

1080
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,840
that cognitive ability is deteriorating.

1081
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,360
And this brings us back to our point

1082
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,160
about bias towards an academic environment.

1083
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,520
Addressing the Flynn effect,

1084
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,680
Herrnstein and Murray write the following.

1085
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,520
There is a further question to answer.

1086
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,360
Does a 15-point IQ difference

1087
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,440
between grandparents and their grandchildren

1088
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,320
mean that the grandchildren are 15 points smarter?

1089
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,200
Some experts do not believe that the rise is holy,

1090
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,240
perhaps not even partly a rise in intelligence,

1091
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,840
but in the narrower skills

1092
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:51,040
involved in intelligence test-taking per se.

1093
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,240
So this, if it were true,

1094
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,520
would mean that people are actually getting less intelligent,

1095
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,960
but at the same time,

1096
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,240
they are getting better at taking IQ tests.

1097
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,520
Now, you might say, isn't that a huge contradiction?

1098
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,920
Aren't they basically admitting that IQ tests

1099
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,200
measure something other than inborn intelligence?

1100
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,000
After all, if IQ tests supposedly measure

1101
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,400
native cognitive ability accurately,

1102
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,160
how could scores be going up

1103
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,800
while cognitive ability is going down?

1104
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,960
However, to be fair to Herrnstein and Murray,

1105
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,800
it would be hasty to dismiss

1106
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,440
their dysgenics hypothesis outright.

1107
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,520
There is another possibility here,

1108
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,040
and it's that people are getting genetically less intelligent,

1109
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,920
but the environmental factors affecting intelligence

1110
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,320
have undergone such large changes

1111
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,800
that their positive effects upon IQ

1112
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,160
are more than accounting

1113
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,720
for the downward genetic ability shift.

1114
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,000
So roughly, we would have lost a genetic IQ point

1115
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,280
thanks to dysgenics,

1116
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,880
but gained two back thanks to a better environment.

1117
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,120
So what evidence does the bell curve produce

1118
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,040
in support of this downward trend

1119
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,200
in genetic cognitive ability?

1120
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,600
Well, unfortunately for Herrnstein and Murray,

1121
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,040
their main source of data,

1122
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,680
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,

1123
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,120
is not much use here.

1124
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,800
Ideally, what we want to do is give IQ tests

1125
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,000
to the children of women who took part in the AFQT,

1126
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,880
so we could directly compare child to parent

1127
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,600
and see if any downwards shift was happening.

1128
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,280
However, this would be a mistake,

1129
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,720
as since our data is coming

1130
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,000
from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,

1131
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,800
the respondents are, appropriately, young.

1132
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,440
People who wait longer to have children

1133
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,160
are typically wealthier and better educated,

1134
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,280
and thus tend to have children with higher IQs.

1135
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,560
Limiting ourselves to looking at only young mothers

1136
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,880
will skew the apparent IQ of the next generation downwards,

1137
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,040
so it would be an inaccurate thing to do.

1138
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,440
Herrnstein and Murray are, thankfully,

1139
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,960
well aware of this problem.

1140
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,880
Not that it stops them from trying, however.

1141
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,440
Herrnstein and Murray's dysgenics hypothesis

1142
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,040
is discussed in Intelligence, Genes, and Success,

1143
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,520
Scientists Respond to the Bell Curve,

1144
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,600
a 1997 book which responds to many of the points

1145
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,040
made in the Bell Curve.

1146
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,960
The authors of that book, for their part,

1147
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,120
find no direct empirical evidence,

1148
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,680
either for or against a dysgenic effect

1149
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,760
acting upon cognitive ability,

1150
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,320
stating that, insofar as we are aware,

1151
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,920
there is nothing but anecdotal evidence for dysgenics.

1152
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,920
Anyway, let's get back on track.

1153
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,280
Now, to illustrate another way IQ tests can be biased,

1154
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,360
I think it would be a good exercise for us all

1155
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:33,600
to briefly take a very simple one-question test together.

1156
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,240
So get your pencil and paper ready, folks.

1157
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:36,880
Here it is.

1158
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,200
Easy, right?

1159
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,320
An incredibly simple number sequence question there,

1160
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,440
the sort you'd expect nearly anyone to be able to work out.

1161
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,040
It's also a fair and unbiased question, of course.

1162
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,920
I mean, everyone was given the exact same question

1163
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,960
and the exact same amount of time to answer it, right?

1164
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,080
What could be more fair and unbiased than that?

1165
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,320
Now, of course, this question is not fair.

1166
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,760
It is biased in favor of Japanese people.

1167
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,920
And anime fans, I guess.

1168
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,000
The point here is that this question would,

1169
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,400
in any language, be biased against people

1170
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,640
who don't speak that language.

1171
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,960
A question in English is biased against people

1172
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,120
who don't speak English, isn't it?

1173
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,400
Now you might protest.

1174
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,480
This seems like a very obvious point.

1175
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,240
I mean, surely nobody is gonna give an IQ test in English

1176
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,880
to a group of people who are not fluent in English

1177
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,000
and then try to pass off those results as legitimate, right?

1178
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,880
Well, stay tuned, folks.

1179
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,840
One point not given due consideration by the bell curve

1180
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,000
during their discussion of testing bias

1181
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,120
is that even a completely unbiased test,

1182
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,760
were it possible to construct such a thing,

1183
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,080
would still deliver biased results

1184
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,960
if it were being carried out in a biased system.

1185
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,040
When Herrnstein and Murray say properly administered IQ tests

1186
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,880
are not demonstrably biased,

1187
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,360
they seemingly mean that the tests themselves

1188
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,920
do not contain words like regatta,

1189
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,600
not that the tests necessarily deliver fair results.

1190
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,440
So that is another potential problem with IQ tests to watch out for.

1191
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,600
Even if we eliminate as much cultural bias as possible from the test,

1192
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,920
we could still, thanks to the wider environment

1193
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,840
the tests are taking place in, be receiving biased results.

1194
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,400
For instance, if you carried out an IQ test

1195
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,920
in a racially segregated white supremacist state,

1196
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,440
that environment is obviously gonna affect the average IQ scores

1197
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,920
of different designated racial groups.

1198
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,120
Now you might protest.

1199
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,680
This also seems like a very obvious point.

1200
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,720
I mean, surely nobody's gonna carry out an IQ test

1201
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,680
in a racially segregated white supremacist state

1202
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,720
and then try to pass off those results as legitimate, right?

1203
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,840
Again, stay tuned, folks.

1204
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,720
Now keeping in mind all the various possible problems

1205
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,880
with IQ testing that we've just discussed,

1206
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,120
let's take a look at a few of the IQ tests

1207
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:57,600
that Herrnstein and Murray cite as evidence for claims in the bell curve.

1208
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,800
Surely they will be properly administered, right?

1209
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,960
After all, Herrnstein and Murray themselves

1210
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,840
discuss many of the same issues that we just have.

1211
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,160
It would follow that given their familiarity

1212
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,520
with these potential problems,

1213
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,320
they would of course endeavor to avoid them.

1214
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,560
So let's see how they do on that front.

1215
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,160
We'll take a look at a particular section of the bell curve now,

1216
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,360
see what the claims are,

1217
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,960
and then have a bit of a dig into the sources backing up those claims.

1218
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,640
And this is from a section titled

1219
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:30,000
How do African Americans compare with blacks in Africa on cognitive tests?

1220
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,120
And I quote,

1221
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,520
This question often arises in the context of black-white comparisons in America,

1222
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,160
the thought being that the African black population

1223
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,720
has not been subjected to the historical legacy

1224
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,360
of American black slavery and discrimination

1225
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,760
and might therefore have higher scores.

1226
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,480
Richard Lynn was able to assemble 11 studies

1227
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,040
in his 1991 review of the literature.

1228
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:55,200
He estimated the median black African IQ to be 75,

1229
01:08:55,200 --> 01:09:00,800
approximately 1.7 standard deviations below the US overall population average,

1230
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,880
about 10 points lower than the current figure for American blacks.

1231
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,440
In summary, African blacks are, on average,

1232
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,280
substantially below African Americans in intelligence test scores.

1233
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,720
Psychometrically, there is little reason to think that these results

1234
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,040
mean anything different about cognitive functioning

1235
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,520
than they mean in non-African populations.

1236
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,240
For our purposes, the main point is that the hypothesis

1237
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:26,160
about the special circumstances of American blacks depressing their test scores

1238
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,120
is not substantiated by the African data.

1239
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,120
So this is Herrnstein and Murray's answer

1240
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,680
to those who point to the legacy of slavery and discrimination in the United States

1241
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,480
as an explanation for the differences in IQ scores

1242
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,720
between its black and white populations.

1243
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,880
They point to black people in Africa and say,

1244
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,680
hey, well, they also got lower scores.

1245
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,720
Black African people haven't been subject to discrimination in America after all,

1246
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,400
so doesn't this prove that discrimination in America

1247
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,480
can't be depressing black IQ scores?

1248
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,800
Well, not really.

1249
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,760
Herrnstein and Murray's decision to limit their concern here

1250
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,160
to American black slavery and discrimination is a huge oversight

1251
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:10,080
because there could also be discrimination in whichever parts of Africa

1252
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,160
they are talking about, if you follow.

1253
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,880
That could be, in a similar way, depressing the scores there, too.

1254
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,920
If that were the case, attempting to use the African data

1255
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,640
as some sort of control test for the American data

1256
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,200
would be fairly ridiculous, to say the least.

1257
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,760
America does not have a monopoly on discrimination and depression, does it?

1258
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,080
And so we need to ask, which parts of Africa are they talking about?

1259
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:38,000
They say that Richard Lin was able to assemble 11 studies

1260
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,800
in his 1991 review of the literature.

1261
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,200
Now, Herrnstein and Murray claiming the acknowledgments

1262
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,600
at the start of the bell curve to have benefited

1263
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,400
especially from the advice of this Richard Lin,

1264
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,720
who they elsewhere call a leading scholar of racial and ethnic differences,

1265
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,920
and they cite his work several times throughout the book.

1266
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,480
So let's take a look at Richard Lin's 1991 review of the literature,

1267
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,800
entitled, Race Differences in Intelligence, A Global Perspective,

1268
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,680
which was published in Mankind Quarterly,

1269
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,920
and remember the name of that journal, folks,

1270
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,400
as we'll be talking more about that later on.

1271
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,640
So the first thing we'll notice about this review

1272
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,360
is that it unfortunately designates people as either

1273
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,640
caucasoids, mongoloids, or negroids,

1274
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,600
including, quote, hybrids of those groups,

1275
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,680
for instance, caucasoid, negroid, hybrids, and so on.

1276
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,120
I can only apologize for having to read out this rubbish.

1277
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,080
So let's look at the 11 studies included in this review

1278
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,360
and see which areas of Africa we are concerned with.

1279
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,200
Well, there's one from what was then known as the Belgian Congo,

1280
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,480
one from Ghana, two from Nigeria, one from Uganda,

1281
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,400
one from Zambia, and five from South Africa.

1282
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,320
And there is rather a lot to comment on here,

1283
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,200
but how about we start with sample sizes?

1284
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,480
Some of them are rather small, you may have noticed.

1285
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:01,440
87 people for Nigeria, 50 people for Uganda, and so on.

1286
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,040
By far the most represented area here is South Africa.

1287
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,360
The number of people tested in South Africa

1288
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,280
was more than double the number of all the other subjects combined.

1289
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,280
And what's the significance of this?

1290
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,320
Well, this review was published in 1991.

1291
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,080
South African apartheid ended in 1994.

1292
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,800
Now, I don't want to get too deep into this right now,

1293
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,240
but for those who don't know,

1294
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,360
apartheid was an explicitly white supremacist system

1295
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,680
of enforced racial segregation.

1296
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,960
Non-white South Africans were openly discriminated against,

1297
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,840
forced from their homes, forbidden to live in certain areas

1298
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,800
and hold certain jobs, and most importantly for us here,

1299
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,040
had to attend segregated schools,

1300
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,920
which were massively underfunded compared to the schools

1301
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,160
that the white South Africans went to,

1302
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,000
many being without electricity or even running water.

1303
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,440
And just so we know the sort of education system we're dealing with here,

1304
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,480
I'll quickly quote some relevant passages from South Africa,

1305
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,440
a country study from the Library of Congress.

1306
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,400
The Bantu Education Act of 1953

1307
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,120
widened the gaps in educational opportunities

1308
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,800
for different racial groups.

1309
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,280
Two of the architects of Bantu education,

1310
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,960
Dr. W.M. Iselin and Dr. Hendrik F. Ferwerd,

1311
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,920
had studied in Germany and adopted many elements

1312
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,200
of National Socialist, Nazi, philosophy.

1313
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,320
The concept of racial purity in particular

1314
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,560
provided a rationalization for keeping black education inferior.

1315
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,120
Ferwerd, then Minister of Native Affairs,

1316
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,760
said that black Africans should be educated

1317
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,160
for their opportunities in life

1318
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,760
and that there was no place for them

1319
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,720
above the level of certain forms of labor.

1320
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,960
The Bantu Education Act helped pave the way

1321
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,920
for labor strife in the 1980s and 1990s

1322
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,120
by institutionalizing a plan to restrict black workers

1323
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,400
to low-paid jobs through deliberately inferior education.

1324
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,600
During the 1960s and 1970s,

1325
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,360
per capita spending on white pupils

1326
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,240
was about ten times greater than educational spending

1327
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,440
on black pupils.

1328
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,560
By the early 1990s, the gap had been reduced by half,

1329
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,960
but in general, standards for teacher qualifications

1330
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,400
and facilities in black schools

1331
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,520
continued to be inferior to those in white schools.

1332
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,880
The discrepancies in education among racial groups were glaring.

1333
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,120
Teacher-pupil ratios in primary schools

1334
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,360
averaged 1 to 18 in white schools,

1335
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,280
1 to 24 in Asian schools,

1336
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,280
1 to 27 in colored schools,

1337
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,440
and 1 to 39 in black schools.

1338
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,200
Moreover, whereas 96% of all teachers in white schools

1339
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,480
had teaching certificates,

1340
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,160
only 15% of teachers in black schools were certified.

1341
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,240
Secondary school pass rates for black pupils

1342
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:37,040
in the nationwide standardized high school graduation exams

1343
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,440
were less than one-half the pass rate for whites.

1344
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,360
You get the point, I think.

1345
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,160
So what Hernstein and Murray have done here

1346
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,520
in attempting to prove that a history of racial discrimination

1347
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,880
in America is not depressing black IQ scores

1348
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,520
is point to a study citing similar scores

1349
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,400
in a system of open racial discrimination.

1350
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,200
This is utterly ridiculous, obviously.

1351
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,760
Anyway, we're now gonna take a look at some of these studies

1352
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,440
compiled by Richard Lin,

1353
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,800
and we'll start with this one, Woburn 1969,

1354
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,680
which apparently reported an IQ score of 86 from Nigeria.

1355
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,080
And here it is, the meaning and stability

1356
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,120
of Raven's matrices test among Africans,

1357
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,960
and let's read a little of that.

1358
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,080
This paper aims to clarify our understanding of factors

1359
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,640
affecting African scores on ability tests,

1360
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,800
Raven's matrices in particular.

1361
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,720
Though the main burden is theoretical,

1362
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,280
some fresh data from Nigeria will be shown.

1363
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,320
During 1965, a testing program was carried out

1364
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,320
among factory workers in Nigeria.

1365
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,360
The results from 86 men will be reported here.

1366
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,760
They were tested individually in English or Pidgin

1367
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,880
by the author with the aid of a trained Nigerian assistant.

1368
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,080
Among the test battery were Raven's progressive matrices

1369
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,560
and an adapted embedded figures test,

1370
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,960
which with an index of educational attainment

1371
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,560
are explained by Woburn.

1372
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,000
Six months after the tests,

1373
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,160
each man was given the matrices again.

1374
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,760
There was no intervening coaching,

1375
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,400
and the test was given as though it was to be a new experience

1376
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,000
with full instructions repeated

1377
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,920
and evidently equally necessary in most cases as previously.

1378
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,160
Men were not overtly asked to pit their presence

1379
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,840
against their previous efforts.

1380
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,080
Results were presented in table one.

1381
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,280
The relation between retested matrices and EFT

1382
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,560
is significantly greater

1383
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,760
than between the initial matrices testing and EFT,

1384
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,600
even though in the former comparisons,

1385
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,000
the tests were done six months apart.

1386
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,800
Table one shows that the overall differences in retesting

1387
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,280
were significant and suggests that improvements

1388
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,800
were found particularly among the lower initial scorers.

1389
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,000
Taken with the improved EFT correlation in table two,

1390
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,560
a strong case can be made that the second testing

1391
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,480
gave a distinctly more valid measure

1392
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,160
of whatever abilities the matrices and EFT involve.

1393
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,960
So to quickly summarize, in 1965,

1394
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,000
researchers gave 86 Nigerian factory workers

1395
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,840
the Raven's Progressive Matrices Test

1396
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,160
and then gave it to them again six months later.

1397
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,600
The second time they took the test,

1398
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,040
they performed better overall,

1399
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,640
and the results better correlated

1400
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,200
with another test they took called the EFT.

1401
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,680
And table one here shows both mean results,

1402
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:10,400
15.9 the first time, increasing to 18.73 the second time.

1403
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,240
What is missing here, you may have noticed, is an IQ score.

1404
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,640
This study does not report an IQ score

1405
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,400
for anyone involved in the test.

1406
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,960
It reports their scores on the matrices test.

1407
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,040
So why then does Lin's review cite Wober 1969

1408
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,080
as having reported an IQ score of 86?

1409
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:32,400
Well, looking at table one, 86 men took the test.

1410
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:33,680
Do you see?

1411
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,160
Now, most likely here, this is a simple typographical error,

1412
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,720
and Lin, or whoever typed up his data,

1413
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,880
accidentally wrote the number of test subjects

1414
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,480
in the IQ field.

1415
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,360
Regardless, though, Lin's review is not accurately

1416
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,560
reporting the IQ score from Wober 1969

1417
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,160
because there wasn't one.

1418
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,680
Lin cites Wober 1969 again in his later book,

1419
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,080
IQ and the Wealth of Nations,

1420
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,600
where he says in 1965, norms for the standard

1421
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,960
progressive matrices were collected by Wober 1969

1422
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,280
for a sample of 86 adult men.

1423
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,760
Their mean score was 15.9.

1424
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,600
And then he later claims that this equates

1425
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,680
to an IQ of 64.

1426
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,240
Now, there are several lies by omission here.

1427
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:21,120
Firstly, Wober 1969 did not report a mean score of 15.9.

1428
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,680
It reported a mean score of 15.9

1429
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:27,120
and a mean score of 18.73.

1430
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,920
It showed how scores go up with retesting.

1431
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,080
And additionally, it claims that a strong case

1432
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,000
can be made that the second testing

1433
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,840
gave a distinctly more valid measure

1434
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,040
of whatever abilities the matrices and EFT involve.

1435
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,680
Lin intentionally chooses to only report

1436
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,200
the lower score here.

1437
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,840
Another lie by omission here is that Lin declines

1438
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,720
to mention that the sample of 86 adult men

1439
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:52,400
were not randomly drawn from the general Nigerian population.

1440
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,720
They were not an accurate representation

1441
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,240
of the society where they lived,

1442
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,320
and nor were they intended to be.

1443
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,560
They were all factory workers.

1444
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,760
Reporting the test results of only 86 men

1445
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,080
who are all employed in the same job

1446
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,840
as representative of a country,

1447
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,280
which at the time had a population of 50 million people,

1448
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,880
is... rubbish.

1449
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,040
Just rubbish.

1450
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,680
Next up, let's talk about this result,

1451
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,440
an IQ of 75 for people in Zambia,

1452
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:27,360
cited from Pons 1974 and Crawford Nutt 1976.

1453
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,280
So the 1976 paper from Crawford Nutt is titled

1454
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,480
Are Black Scores on Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices

1455
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,960
an Artifact of Test Presentation?

1456
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,080
And opens by saying that previous research has shown that

1457
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,400
when the method of test presentation ensures

1458
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,200
that testees understand adequately the requirements

1459
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,880
of the test situation,

1460
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,520
when the method also makes certain that the testees know

1461
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,640
how items of the test are to be responded to,

1462
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,600
and when the method reduces the anxiety of the subjects

1463
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,120
about being tested,

1464
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,160
then the results obtained from the administration of the test

1465
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,560
are remarkably different from those that result

1466
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,280
from administration in which the same test is presented

1467
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,200
in the same way to all testees,

1468
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,440
regardless of their cultural origin.

1469
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,480
It goes on to detail how a researcher named Pons

1470
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,200
gave the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test

1471
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,800
to a group of Zambian copper miners in 1962,

1472
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,040
using the standard method of delivery.

1473
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,040
Then later, Pons administered the test again to another group,

1474
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,800
only this time using a different method of test presentation.

1475
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,240
As table one shows,

1476
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,000
the second group showed a rather dramatic difference in score.

1477
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,080
Now, the thinking behind all this might be

1478
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,400
that a group of Zambian copper miners

1479
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,800
aren't necessarily going to be all that familiar

1480
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,680
with taking academic tests, not to generalize,

1481
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,600
and if you want more accurate results,

1482
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,880
it might be worth taking the time to actually explain to them

1483
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,120
what it is that they're being expected to do.

1484
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,960
Now, Crawford Knott claims

1485
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,720
that the different method of presentation

1486
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,040
did not alter anything about the test itself

1487
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,240
and is based upon suggestions found in the 1960 guide

1488
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,160
to the standard progressive matrices written by John C. Raven,

1489
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:08,640
AKA the guy what invented the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.

1490
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,880
After reporting the findings of Pons,

1491
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,360
Crawford Knott takes things one step further

1492
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:17,200
and tests a selection of pupils from a long-established high school

1493
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:22,080
situated in the black residential area of Soweto near Johannesburg,

1494
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,720
a school that is described as having high standards

1495
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,680
and whose students would be used to being tested.

1496
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,640
Crawford Knott tested two samples of these schoolchildren

1497
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,680
using the same presentation method as described by Pons,

1498
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,400
and the results received were actually slightly higher

1499
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,280
than the equivalent age range of the white group

1500
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,600
on whom the test was normalized.

1501
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,680
Now, you might say, what has Crawford Knott actually proved there?

1502
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:50,320
Test results go up the closer you get to a good school, I suppose.

1503
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,640
This shouldn't be surprising anyone.

1504
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,080
If you test a relatively uneducated group of copper miners,

1505
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,440
you get one result.

1506
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,800
Do that same test in a competitive academic institution

1507
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,720
and you will get a higher result.

1508
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,960
By changing the method of test presentation

1509
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,520
and changing the group which you are testing,

1510
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,600
you can get a whole range of results.

1511
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,320
This is why researchers don't usually test people

1512
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,600
in just one area, one workplace, or one school

1513
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,080
and then try to pass off that singular result

1514
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,600
as representative of the entire country that they live in.

1515
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,560
That would be a remarkably ignorant thing to do.

1516
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:30,240
Speaking of, back to Richard Lin and his claimed IQ of 75 for Zambia,

1517
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,800
which cites both Pons and Crawford Knott

1518
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,480
as the source of the data there.

1519
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,240
So how did that happen?

1520
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,760
Well, what Lin does is, he cites the much lower results

1521
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,760
from the research carried out by Pons,

1522
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,720
which are presented in Crawford Knott's paper,

1523
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:48,240
and then completely ignores Crawford Knott's experiment in the school,

1524
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,960
which reported results above the white norm.

1525
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,840
The entire point of Crawford Knott's paper goes totally unmentioned by Lin,

1526
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:00,240
who simply extracts the data that he wants and discards the rest.

1527
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:03,360
He had data showing a black African test score

1528
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,120
that was above the white norm,

1529
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,000
and he simply decided to ignore it.

1530
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,320
Also, like the previous paper we discussed,

1531
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,560
this study did not report IQ scores for the testees.

1532
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,400
Those are simply concocted by Lin

1533
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,880
out of the Raven's progressive matrices data,

1534
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,120
using a sophisticated statistical technique called guessing.

1535
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,960
So to understand what Lin has done here,

1536
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,200
we need to talk a little about IQ test construction and standardization.

1537
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,200
And let's start with the bell curve.

1538
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,520
Not the book this time, but the statistical distribution.

1539
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:41,040
Now, IQ tests, as we know, return this bell curve, or normal distribution.

1540
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,800
This means that the majority of the scores are clustered around the middle

1541
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,560
and taper off towards the ends of the curve in a symmetrical way.

1542
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,280
But why, you might ask, do they actually return this distribution?

1543
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,520
Well, it's because that's how they're designed.

1544
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,800
Psychometricians design IQ tests so that their results match the bell curve.

1545
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,040
If the test they design is too easy,

1546
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,880
then the bell curve will lean to the right,

1547
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,120
as too many people will get high scores.

1548
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,240
If the test is too hard, it will lean to the left,

1549
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,480
as too many people get low scores.

1550
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:16,400
And if the test doesn't differentiate between people to the right degree,

1551
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,840
then too many people could be at either end of the curve.

1552
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,520
So the test designers tinker with the difficulty of the test

1553
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,840
until the results match the bell curve.

1554
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,960
So why do psychometricians do this?

1555
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,240
Well, it's because that's how they assume intelligence is distributed

1556
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,000
throughout the human population.

1557
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,880
Emphasis on assume here,

1558
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,400
because we do not actually know how intelligence is distributed

1559
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,160
throughout the human population.

1560
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,800
Unless you specifically design for it,

1561
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,720
tests do not necessarily return a bell curve distribution.

1562
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,840
For example here,

1563
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,280
the armed forces qualifying test used in the bell curve

1564
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,840
did not return a bell curve distribution.

1565
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:01,200
It was, after all, designed to test readiness to join the armed forces, not IQ.

1566
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:05,040
As a result, it does not differentiate between people to a large enough degree,

1567
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:09,120
so Hernstein and Murray, to make the results conform to a bell curve,

1568
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,280
recalculated the scores.

1569
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:16,080
Here is a graph of the raw AFQT scores overlaid with Hernstein and Murray's

1570
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:20,400
recalculated bell curve scores from the book Inequality by Design.

1571
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,920
And as we can see, too many people scored too highly on the test

1572
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,400
and there isn't enough differentiation between people

1573
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,800
on the upper end of the scale in particular.

1574
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,160
So yes, that's right.

1575
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,840
In the book The Bell Curve,

1576
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,120
the principal intelligence test the authors use as a source

1577
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,600
did not return a bell curve distribution.

1578
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,240
To transform these results into a bell curve,

1579
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:44,800
Hernstein and Murray exaggerated the slight differences at the end of the scale.

1580
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,880
They basically gave extra credit for being near the tails of the bell curve

1581
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,120
and less for being in the middle.

1582
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:55,600
They did this as they explain in Appendix 2 to correct for skew.

1583
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,880
But remember, in relation to how intelligence is distributed

1584
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,720
throughout the human population,

1585
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,120
these results are only actually skewed

1586
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:07,760
if we assume that intelligence is distributed in a bell curve to begin with.

1587
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,520
This is circular logic.

1588
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,880
We are assuming the result that we are going to get beforehand

1589
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,480
and then designing the test or just manipulating the data

1590
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,560
in order to reach that conclusion.

1591
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,400
Anyway, to get back on track here,

1592
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,120
what does all this have to do with Richard Lin and the Raven's progressive matrices test?

1593
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,280
Well, that test also does not return a bell curve distribution.

1594
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,640
The results are not symmetrically distributed around their mean,

1595
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,600
to quote an article by psychologist Leon Kamin.

1596
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,200
That article also notes that the test's developer, John Raven,

1597
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:44,480
always insisted that the progressive matrices scores cannot be converted into IQs.

1598
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,760
Here is an example of the distribution of matrix test scores

1599
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:52,240
from Raven's paper, Standardization of Progressive Matrices 1938.

1600
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:56,240
And as you can see, those are some very wobbly bell curves right there.

1601
01:26:56,240 --> 01:27:01,120
What the test does give is raw scores which correspond to percentile scores.

1602
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,120
So you can know from your raw score how you compare percentile-wise

1603
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,680
to the group on which the test was normalized.

1604
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:13,040
But these percentiles will not be distributed evenly around their mean in a bell curve.

1605
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:17,680
To calculate IQ, Richard Lin takes the average of these raw scores,

1606
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,000
converts them to a percentile score,

1607
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,720
and then gives what the IQ of that percentile score would correspond to

1608
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:28,240
if the results were in a bell curve distribution.

1609
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:32,560
Basically, Lin is assuming a bell curve exists where there demonstrably isn't one

1610
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,800
and is forcing the data to fit it.

1611
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,480
Another issue here is that in the decades since the Second World War,

1612
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:43,760
scores on the Raven's matrices test similar to IQ test scores had been changing.

1613
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,200
Accordingly, the test had been standardized several times.

1614
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:51,200
So when we're comparing the African results with Western norms,

1615
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,080
we need to identify what norm group we're using

1616
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:59,280
because comparisons with different groups from different times could give different results.

1617
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:04,000
Particularly sharp-eyed viewers would have noticed that Lin does exactly this

1618
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,320
in the quote from his 2002 book,

1619
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,200
IQ and the Wealth of Nations, which I showed earlier,

1620
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:12,160
where he discusses Nigerian IQs, quote,

1621
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:16,000
in terms of the British 1979 standardization.

1622
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,600
Identifying this standardization is important,

1623
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:25,040
as using a different one could lead to a different Nigerian IQ being calculated.

1624
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:29,520
In his 1991 review of the literature cited in the bell curve, however,

1625
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:35,440
Lin does not identify what standardization he's using for the various tests he is comparing.

1626
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,640
What this means is that there is a gap in Lin's calculations

1627
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,480
that can only be filled by faith in his academic honesty,

1628
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,720
which Hearnstein and Murray clearly have,

1629
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,520
but I must confess that I do not.

1630
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,040
Anyway, if you think what Lin did to those last two studies was bad,

1631
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,240
strap in, because this next one is a real bastard.

1632
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:59,600
South Africa IQ of 69, attributed to Owen, 1989,

1633
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,240
which Lin calls the single best study of the Negroid Intelligence.

1634
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,520
So this is test and item bias,

1635
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,520
the suitability of the junior aptitude tests as a common test battery

1636
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,560
for white, Indian, and black pupils in standard 7.

1637
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,600
Owen is not one for catchy names, apparently.

1638
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,000
The abstract to this study starts out,

1639
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,560
This study was undertaken to shed light on problems

1640
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,360
concerning the construction and use of a common test battery

1641
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,920
for various South African population groups.

1642
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,480
You see, this study is testing a test,

1643
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,600
the Junior Aptitude Test, or JAT,

1644
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,880
which was standardized for white pupils in South Africa

1645
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,800
and determining whether it's also a good test to give to non-white groups.

1646
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:46,000
The study selected various schools in South Africa for white, Indian, and black students.

1647
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,120
Although it should be mentioned,

1648
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,480
it was not able to use the majority of the selected black schools,

1649
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:50,960
quote,

1650
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:56,640
and thus they had to test black schools in the KwaZulu region,

1651
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:01,840
one of the areas designated for black inhabitants of South Africa under apartheid.

1652
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,800
I mention the unrest situation here as a reminder that,

1653
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,840
yes, these tests are being carried out under apartheid,

1654
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:13,040
and protests and demonstrations against the segregated school system were ongoing.

1655
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,600
So anyway, the study examined pupils' performances

1656
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,640
on the various sub-tests comprising the JAT,

1657
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,160
and what were the findings?

1658
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,160
Well, the thing I think we should mention first here

1659
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:26,480
is that the tests were given to the black students in KwaZulu in English only,

1660
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:31,600
and several test sections of the JAT relied very heavily upon language ability.

1661
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,120
Now, Owen expected language ability not to matter in the tests

1662
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,760
because the black students in the KwaZulu region

1663
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:41,120
had ostensibly been learning English in their schools.

1664
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,760
Owen apparently either doesn't know or disregards

1665
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,120
that these schools often didn't have necessary teaching equipment,

1666
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,760
only a small amount of their teachers were certified,

1667
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,440
and that pupil-teacher ratios were more than double that of the white schools.

1668
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,720
And to quote the study,

1669
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:59,920
language was not expected to play a significant role in test performance in this investigation.

1670
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,760
However, the results showed that this assumption was completely wrong.

1671
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,480
In fact, language played such an important role,

1672
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,080
and the knowledge of English of the majority of black testees was so poor

1673
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,760
that certain tests, for example the JAT-4 synonyms

1674
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,640
and the JAT-8 memory paragraph, proved to be virtually unusable.

1675
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,200
And let me just quote that again.

1676
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:24,960
Certain tests proved to be virtually unusable.

1677
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,800
Owen also writes elsewhere,

1678
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:31,520
the results of the current investigation clearly show that language played a prominent role

1679
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,160
in all the tests containing language items,

1680
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:38,640
which is a wonderful multiple stab wounds shown to shorten life expectancy,

1681
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:41,280
bit of academic obviousness there.

1682
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:46,400
Language ability was not the only way in which the Junior Aptitude Test was biased, however.

1683
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,840
In a section entitled Item Bias in the Tests of the JAT,

1684
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,880
Owen notes several ways in which the tests were culturally and economically biased.

1685
01:31:54,880 --> 01:32:00,320
For example, he here lists several test items on the first test in the JAT and states,

1686
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,560
A common element in most of these items was that they presuppose knowledge

1687
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,440
or a degree of knowledge on the part of the testee,

1688
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,480
and mentions such things as electrical appliances,

1689
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:14,400
microscopes, and Western types of ladies' accessories.

1690
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,680
Going on to write,

1691
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,560
Thus in the case of both the Indian and Black testees,

1692
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,400
it seems that the single largest cause of bias lay in the fact that the pupils

1693
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,240
were not familiar with the objects represented by the pictures.

1694
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:31,440
Cultural and socioeconomic status factors probably also played a role in this regard.

1695
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,600
So this test is biased, then.

1696
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,800
The study examining it says it is biased,

1697
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,480
but according to Richard Lin,

1698
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:42,960
this is the single best study of the Negroid Intelligence.

1699
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,480
This is the best one.

1700
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,800
The one that tests segregated school children in a non-native language

1701
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,760
and calls its own results virtually unusable.

1702
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,800
In Lin's review,

1703
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,720
this is the most important study for his estimates of Black African IQ.

1704
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,800
Writing about it, he says,

1705
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:04,320
The mean IQ of the sample in comparison with Caucasoid South African norms is 69.

1706
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,160
It is also around the median of the studies listed in Table 3.

1707
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:11,360
It is proposed, therefore, to round this figure up to 70.

1708
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,120
Why?

1709
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:17,280
And take this as the approximate mean for pure Negroids.

1710
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,320
God damn.

1711
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,800
What Lin has done here is ridiculous.

1712
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:26,560
He has taken 11 studies from a period between 1929 and 1991,

1713
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:31,360
with vastly different sample sizes reporting data from different tests,

1714
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,480
most of which didn't even report IQ scores,

1715
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:39,040
transformed the data into what he reckons the equivalent IQ scores were

1716
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,600
using some unknown standardization,

1717
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,240
picked one that was sort of near the middle,

1718
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,960
and said that's the average Black African IQ.

1719
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,920
This is outrageous.

1720
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,440
It is a crime.

1721
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,720
It might actually be a crime, and if it's not, it should be.

1722
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,600
Now, I am far from the first person to criticize

1723
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,480
the Bell Curve's reliance upon Richard Lin as a source.

1724
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,960
Various academics were already well aware of Lin and his dodgy data,

1725
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,040
so when Herrnstein and Murray cited him,

1726
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:11,840
they were immediately attacked with accusations of bias and racism.

1727
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,840
Charles Murray responds to these attacks in the afterword to the Bell Curve,

1728
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,520
and his defense is laughable.

1729
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,800
His first defense is to say that the topic of African IQ

1730
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:26,080
is a tiny piece of the Bell Curve, three paragraphs on pages 288 to 89,

1731
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,520
and in regards to this, two responses jump to mind immediately.

1732
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:34,160
The first is to say, well, maybe you should have spent longer on it then, Charles.

1733
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,000
We were wrong very quickly.

1734
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,640
Isn't a defense against being wrong, is it?

1735
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,400
Maybe if you put a little more effort in,

1736
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,520
you would have seen that Lin's paper was a load of rubbish.

1737
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:48,160
Secondly, this part of the Bell Curve is far more important than Murray makes out.

1738
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,200
He uses Lin's paper to dismiss the arguments

1739
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:55,360
that black-white differences in IQ are caused by environmental factors,

1740
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,120
such as a history of oppression,

1741
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,920
which is the single most common counterargument

1742
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,880
to one of the principal claims in the entire book.

1743
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,440
At no point does Murray actually address any specific criticisms of Lin's work

1744
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,520
or any of its various errors.

1745
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:14,560
He mainly just seems outraged that anyone dares to have criticized him at all, to be honest.

1746
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,280
And it's exactly this sort of academic laziness

1747
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,480
that fed much of the angry response to the Bell Curve.

1748
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,600
Murray refuses to admit that citing Lin was a mistake,

1749
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,720
and simply throws out some newer studies that supposedly show he was right anyway.

1750
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:29,760
So there.

1751
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,000
This speaks to a couple of things.

1752
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,320
Firstly, it is a fatal underestimation of exactly how badly this damages

1753
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,000
the faith that a reader of the Bell Curve can have in its authors.

1754
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,120
After all, this is not the only time they cite Richard Lin.

1755
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,240
He has more than 20 citations in their bibliography,

1756
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,040
and they thank him specifically in the acknowledgments.

1757
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:53,520
If this is the sort of data that Charles Murray is willing to accept as legitimate,

1758
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,800
how can we trust anything he says anywhere in the book?

1759
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,320
How can we trust the new studies he brings up to defend Richard Lin?

1760
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,920
Personally, I think it would be a mistake to even look at these new studies.

1761
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,360
Murray's response to having his previous sources called into question

1762
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,760
is to simply throw out new sources.

1763
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,400
His response to having these called into question would no doubt be to throw out more.

1764
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,560
The responsibility for checking whether his sources are trustworthy or accurate

1765
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,760
has been moved from Murray to his critics.

1766
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,160
They're the ones doing the reading and the fact-checking,

1767
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,800
whereas he never gets held to account.

1768
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:34,000
So long as we all understand that, however, I suppose we can take a brief peek.

1769
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,200
So, Murray says,

1770
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:40,880
Let me turn to two studies post-dating Richard Lin's review that we cite on page 289.

1771
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,600
One was a South African study led by Kenneth Owen,

1772
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:48,320
published in the refereed British journal Personality and Individual Differences.

1773
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:52,320
So this was the suitability of Raven's standard progressive matrices

1774
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,480
for various groups in South Africa,

1775
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,080
a paper that was published in 1992.

1776
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:01,280
So we are still in apartheid South Africa.

1777
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,960
And this study tested black students from the KwaZulu region,

1778
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,080
the same as one of the studies from Richard Lin's review.

1779
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,080
It even has the same author.

1780
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,680
So this is not a great showing with the first study here.

1781
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:16,080
Murray introduces the other study by saying,

1782
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,480
The second example of a recent careful study

1783
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:22,800
was conducted by a black scholar, Fred Cindy, and published in The Psychologist.

1784
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,920
It matched 204 black Zimbabwean pupils

1785
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,600
and 202 white English students from London inner-city schools

1786
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,240
for age, 12 to 14 years old, sex, and educational level,

1787
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:37,200
both samples being characterized as working class,

1788
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,920
and then goes on to say that the white students from London

1789
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:44,240
got higher test results than the black students from Zimbabwe.

1790
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:48,800
However, Murray takes the cue from Richard Lin and leaves out all the context.

1791
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:53,440
The main thing here being that Zimbabwe was a British colony known as Rhodesia

1792
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:58,720
until it gained independence in 1980, following a 15-year civil war.

1793
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:03,280
Rhodesia was a discriminatory racially segregated state.

1794
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:09,360
12 to 14-year-olds in 1994 would have been born around the time of Zimbabwe's independence

1795
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:14,080
to parents who were raised and educated in a segregated British colony.

1796
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:18,560
Which makes the comparison to the children of London as all the more ridiculous here.

1797
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,680
The children of the colonized country are being measured

1798
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:24,480
against the children of the colonizing country.

1799
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,040
Fred Cindy, the professor who offered the study,

1800
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,080
more recently spoke about his earlier work in the following way.

1801
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,760
For many years, African countries have depended upon the use

1802
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,080
of Western-designed psychometric instruments

1803
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,920
such as Raven's progressive matrices and some others.

1804
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:44,720
Such tests, standardized in Western cultures using Western cultural values,

1805
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:47,600
have been found to be useful to a certain extent.

1806
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,760
In many cases, interpretation of results from Western-designed tests

1807
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:57,120
have however been distorted to suit Western stereotypes about other nations.

1808
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,120
Cindy 1994.

1809
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:03,680
A very important point which Lin and Murray would do well to take on board.

1810
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:08,560
Murray reveals a misunderstanding of the criticisms raised against the bell curve

1811
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,000
when he goes on to say that the problem is not as often alleged

1812
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,880
that such studies are written by racists.

1813
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,640
In the two instances just cited,

1814
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:21,040
a charge belied by Owen's scholarly reputation and by Cindy's race,

1815
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:24,000
but that the African story is still so incomplete.

1816
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,240
What Murray gets wrong here,

1817
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:29,200
beyond the implication that a scholarly reputation

1818
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,000
could not also be accompanied by racism,

1819
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,160
is that the allegation is not that these studies are written by racists.

1820
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:39,280
It's that the studies are being deliberately misinterpreted

1821
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:42,080
and misrepresented by racists.

1822
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,000
Racists like Richard Lin,

1823
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,960
who stripped from the studies all context and analysis

1824
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:49,840
and used them to push a racist worldview.

1825
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,520
Murray fails to see that the problem is not that it is impossible

1826
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,000
to find other studies that have similar results to the ones cited in the bell curve.

1827
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,200
It's that he's willing to treat data collected in a segregated white supremacist state

1828
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:08,000
as a legitimate source to inform us about inherent racial differences.

1829
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,840
That is the issue here.

1830
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,120
On a more general note,

1831
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:14,240
what Murray writes in the afterword and how he writes it

1832
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,880
shows us exactly how little respect he has

1833
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,680
for what should be treated as a sensitive topic.

1834
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:23,120
The subject of his writing is potential differences

1835
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,920
in native ability between racial groups,

1836
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,360
and discussing that requires a level of tact and consideration

1837
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,680
that is totally absent here.

1838
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:35,120
You cannot half-ass the science with this stuff.

1839
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:39,920
Murray's refusal to respond directly to criticism of his sources here

1840
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,160
exposes him as a fraud.

1841
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:45,920
We're going to move on now and consider how the bell curve measures intelligence

1842
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:49,920
against socioeconomic status in determining one's life outcomes.

1843
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,560
But I'd like you to keep in mind, if possible,

1844
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,040
several of the things we've talked about so far.

1845
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,680
The difficulty in defining intelligence.

1846
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:00,480
The difficulties in testing for intelligence.

1847
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:04,160
The bell curve's missing genetic evidence for IQ.

1848
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,880
And of course, the incredibly shoddy sources

1849
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,560
that Hernstein and Murray are apparently willing to accept.

1850
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,000
When we see a graph measuring intelligence against environment,

1851
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,880
we should not be fooled into thinking that that intelligence

1852
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,160
was legitimately or accurately calculated.

1853
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,440
Anyway, to the claim.

1854
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:25,280
One's IQ is more important than one's social background

1855
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,280
in determining one's life outcomes.

1856
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:31,600
To address this claim, we first need to define the terms.

1857
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,480
We know by now how Hernstein and Murray have been determining

1858
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,720
the IQ of the people they're examining

1859
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:40,240
by using their scores on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test.

1860
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:43,360
But in order to make comparisons to their IQ,

1861
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:47,840
how is the bell curve determining those people's socioeconomic status?

1862
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:53,920
Let's take as an example poverty from Chapter 5 of the bell curve titled Poverty.

1863
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:56,800
Hernstein and Murray want to compare low intelligence

1864
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,480
with low socioeconomic status as causes for poverty

1865
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,040
to figure out which is more important.

1866
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:08,240
They use the survey respondents' AFQT scores as their data for intelligence,

1867
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:11,760
and they use socioeconomic information provided by the respondents

1868
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,840
to build what they call an index of socioeconomic status.

1869
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:19,360
Both of these are then compared with the likelihood of the respondents

1870
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,760
being below the poverty line a decade later.

1871
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,560
And of course, Hernstein and Murray find that intelligence

1872
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,960
is the better predictor of poverty.

1873
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:30,240
So I guess we'd better examine exactly how Hernstein and Murray

1874
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:33,520
constructed their index of socioeconomic status.

1875
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:38,160
But before we get to that, I'd like to propose a question for us to answer.

1876
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:40,960
What environmental factors would you deem important

1877
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,880
with regards to the likelihood of a young person being in poverty?

1878
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,760
And let's discuss a few possibilities here.

1879
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,480
First up, parental socioeconomic status,

1880
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:55,360
which is usually defined as their level of education, occupation, and income.

1881
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,000
I think we'd all agree that is fairly important.

1882
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,680
Families that have a larger income are less likely to be in poverty.

1883
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:04,640
Better educated parents are more likely to have better jobs

1884
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:07,200
and therefore less likely to have children in poverty.

1885
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,960
This is rather straightforward.

1886
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,280
Family composition is important.

1887
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,840
A family with a particular income and living space

1888
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,720
stretched to take care of six children, say,

1889
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:20,160
is gonna have a harder time than a family with the same income and living space

1890
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,480
but only one child to take care of.

1891
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,960
So number of siblings is important,

1892
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:29,200
as is whether or not the individual was raised in a two-parent family.

1893
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,680
Two parents typically means more resources

1894
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,080
and therefore less chance of being in poverty.

1895
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,960
The area where someone lives is very important.

1896
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,960
One family with a particular income might have a very different living experience

1897
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:45,120
to another family with the same income that lives in a different area.

1898
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,520
And this could be for a variety of reasons.

1899
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:52,640
Average living expenses like rent, food, and other costs that vary from place to place,

1900
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:55,760
the average crime rate, the unemployment rate,

1901
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,600
that can be very important for determining one's chance of being in poverty.

1902
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,200
Seems fairly obvious to mention,

1903
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,920
but you're gonna have an easier time finding an income

1904
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,680
in an area with many jobs than an area with few jobs.

1905
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:11,680
Another reason the area someone lives is important to us here is school quality,

1906
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,600
which should be particularly noteworthy,

1907
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,040
given that we're measuring all of this against performance on an academic test.

1908
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:20,400
How long someone stays in school is also important,

1909
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,800
and how many years of education they completed

1910
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,480
both before and after taking the armed forces qualifying test.

1911
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:30,640
Familial wealth is important, and this is a separate issue to income.

1912
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,400
One person with a particular income,

1913
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:36,720
whose rich parents bought them a house and a car and paid their way through college,

1914
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:40,160
is gonna have a different experience to a person on the same income,

1915
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:43,440
but who has to pay off debt related to all of those things.

1916
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,120
Overall, economic trends can be very important.

1917
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:50,560
You are more likely to be in poverty during a recession.

1918
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,520
The reason that the poverty rate increases during recessions

1919
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,440
is not because everyone collectively loses a few IQ points, is it?

1920
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
And the effects of recession are felt unequally across economic classes

1921
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,920
and different geographical areas.

1922
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,560
One's gender is important.

1923
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,000
Women, for example, are more likely to be in poverty than men are.

1924
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,880
Now, whether you believe this is because women have lower genetic IQs than men do,

1925
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,640
or you're sensible and you believe it's because of environmental reasons,

1926
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:19,840
it is the case.

1927
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,160
I should note here that I'm excluding race

1928
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,560
because this chapter of the bell curve concerns itself

1929
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,680
with only the white respondents to the AFQT.

1930
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:30,160
Your health is important, of course.

1931
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:33,760
People with disabilities, for instance, are more likely to be in poverty,

1932
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,600
and particularly in the US, the cost of medical care and health insurance

1933
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:41,040
can massively affect someone's likelihood of being in poverty.

1934
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:44,640
And we could go on listing things, but we will arbitrarily stop here.

1935
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,720
I trust you get the point by now.

1936
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:49,040
There are lots of different things to consider

1937
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:52,000
when attempting to determine how someone's environment

1938
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,480
might contribute to them being in poverty.

1939
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,880
Which brings us back to the bell curve.

1940
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,040
Which of the various factors on this list

1941
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,280
did Hernstein and Murray think were important

1942
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:05,360
with regards to the likelihood of a young person being in poverty?

1943
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,280
The first one.

1944
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:09,120
Yep, that's all.

1945
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,720
Hernstein and Murray's consideration of environmental factors

1946
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,920
extends to parental education, income, and occupation.

1947
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:16,880
That's all.

1948
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,160
As far as they're concerned,

1949
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:20,960
with regards to the determining predictors of poverty,

1950
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,280
all the other things on this list have no effect.

1951
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,040
Your family's wealth has no effect.

1952
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,360
Family composition, the area where you live,

1953
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:31,760
the quality of the school you went to, the crime rate, all irrelevant.

1954
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,520
What they have done here is substitute environmental factors

1955
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,240
for parental socioeconomic status,

1956
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:41,680
which is a much narrower category of variables.

1957
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:45,360
They simply add together parental education, income, and occupation,

1958
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:49,760
call that parental socioeconomic status, and plot it against IQ.

1959
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:51,680
And this is the graph they come up with.

1960
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:54,800
The comparative roles of IQ and parental SES

1961
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,560
in determining whether young white adults are below the poverty line.

1962
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,840
It shows that people with low IQs are more likely to be in poverty

1963
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,400
than people whose parents had a low SES.

1964
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:05,760
And also the reverse.

1965
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,400
High IQ people are less likely to be in poverty

1966
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,200
than people whose parents had a high SES.

1967
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,520
Cognitive ability is more important

1968
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,760
than parental socioeconomic status in determining poverty, they say.

1969
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,520
But of course, as we have seen,

1970
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,840
their consideration of environmental factors here is laughably narrow.

1971
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,640
They only want to consider as valid things

1972
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,840
that fall under their definition of parental SES.

1973
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,040
And they ignore all the other relevant environmental factors.

1974
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,680
What would happen to this graph if we also considered the various other things

1975
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,880
that Hernstein and Murray leave out of their analysis?

1976
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,640
Now, I don't know how to do regression analysis, unfortunately,

1977
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:47,840
but the book Inequality by Design was written by some people

1978
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,000
who do know how to do regression analysis,

1979
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,880
and they do exactly what we're looking for here.

1980
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:57,600
Firstly, they recreate Hernstein and Murray's calculations using their data.

1981
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:01,040
They then use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Responses

1982
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:04,880
to add more environmental data to the analysis.

1983
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,080
Their first updated graph changes parental SES to parental home environment,

1984
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,880
adding for consideration things like the number of siblings

1985
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,360
and whether the household has two parents.

1986
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:20,800
As we can see, AFQT score is still more important than parental home environment,

1987
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,680
but now the two are much closer together.

1988
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,280
Next up, they add community environment to home environment,

1989
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,720
considering the region where the respondent lived when they took the test

1990
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:32,640
and the school that they attended.

1991
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:37,280
Doing this, we see that AFQT score and social environment are now equal.

1992
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,840
Next, they add for consideration the number of years of education

1993
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,000
of the respondents to the survey.

1994
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,480
And by now, the AFQT score has slipped

1995
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:49,840
below the combined environmental factors in importance.

1996
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:54,000
Using the same statistical methods and data set as the bell curve,

1997
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,760
Inequality by Design's analysis shows that environmental factors

1998
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,480
are more important than AFQT score

1999
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,440
in determining the probability of being in poverty.

2000
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,800
And this is shown using only the limited data available

2001
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,840
in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, remember.

2002
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,120
Inequality by Design adds to the analysis only a few

2003
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:18,160
of the conceivable socioeconomic factors that are ignored by Hernstein and Murray.

2004
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:21,920
If we were to continue adding in available factors to consider,

2005
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,120
the effect of IQ would get weaker and weaker.

2006
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:28,960
And lest you think Inequality by Design's analysis was a one-off,

2007
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:34,240
the authors of Intelligence, Genes, and Success also reanalyzed the NLSY data,

2008
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:36,640
and with regards to how much cognitive ability

2009
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,800
accounts for differences in wages between people, say the following.

2010
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:44,640
However, our results conflict with the predictions of Hernstein and Murray.

2011
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:48,240
Ability factors other than G are economically useful.

2012
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:51,920
Compared with education, family background, and region of residence,

2013
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,880
G explains little of the variance in wages.

2014
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,800
If there exists some X factor that can explain the large residuals

2015
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:03,040
common in wage regressions, it is not measured cognitive ability.

2016
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:08,000
In summary, our re-analyses of the NLSY data originally analyzed by Hernstein and Murray

2017
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,440
show measured cognitive ability is correlated with wages,

2018
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:16,080
but explains little of the variance in wages across individuals and time.

2019
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:21,280
Later in this chapter, Hernstein and Murray use this same narrowly defined parental SES

2020
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:25,520
to consider which young people will drop out of school, get a college degree,

2021
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,920
be unemployed, have children out of wedlock, be on welfare, and so on.

2022
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:33,360
To be fair, sometimes they do add other factors to consider,

2023
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:39,360
but again, only when they personally, subjectively, decide those factors are important.

2024
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:44,160
All their comparisons between IQ and SES that inform their later policy proposals

2025
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:47,440
are based upon this calculated decision to not consider

2026
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,400
the full range of relevant environmental factors.

2027
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:54,480
And there's two other important points that we have to keep in mind here.

2028
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:58,160
The first is that we have been assuming that AFQT score

2029
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:00,960
is a legitimate stand-in for cognitive ability,

2030
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:05,520
which, given all the potential problems with intelligence testing we've already discussed,

2031
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,120
is a bit of a stretch.

2032
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:11,680
The second thing we need to remember is that Hernstein and Murray's estimation of IQ

2033
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:15,600
is that it is only 60% genetically heritable.

2034
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,680
That would mean, according to their flawed understanding of heritability anyway,

2035
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:26,720
that 40% of the IQ score in their calculations originated from environmental factors.

2036
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:32,320
Considering all these things together, the case for IQ here is looking incredibly flimsy.

2037
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:37,600
So as we've seen, once you add more factors to consider, environment trumps IQ.

2038
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:43,200
So we now have to ask, is this a legitimate thing to do, statistically speaking?

2039
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:46,720
The bell curve anticipates being criticized in this manner.

2040
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:50,880
In a section titled, But What About Other Explanations?, they write,

2041
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,680
We can already hear critics saying, if only they'd added this other variable to the analysis,

2042
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:58,560
they would have seen that intelligence has nothing to do with x.

2043
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:03,440
At this point, however, statistical analysis can become a bottomless pit.

2044
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:07,840
It is not uncommon in technical journals to read articles built around the estimated effects

2045
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,560
of a dozen or more independent variables.

2046
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:15,280
Sometimes the entire set of variables is loaded into a single regression equation.

2047
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:19,760
Sometimes sets of equations are used, modeling even more complex relationships

2048
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:23,600
in which all the variables can exert mutual effects on one another.

2049
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,280
Why should we not press forward?

2050
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:30,480
Why not also ask if religious background has an effect on the decision to go on welfare, for example?

2051
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:34,880
It's an interesting question, as are 50 others that might come to mind.

2052
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:37,680
This is the first of two defenses by Hanstein and Murray,

2053
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:41,920
where they argue that it would just be too complicated to consider all the factors.

2054
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:48,000
Why there could be 50 environmental variables affecting someone's likelihood of being in poverty,

2055
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,600
that's just too many.

2056
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,200
It would be too complex.

2057
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,000
Our graph wouldn't make any sense if we did that.

2058
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,080
So instead of 50, we're just gonna consider, I don't know, two.

2059
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,200
This is a result of treating the method of investigation

2060
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:04,480
as more important than getting accurate results.

2061
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:08,240
If you can't use regression analysis to fairly compare IQ

2062
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:11,760
to all the relevant environmental factors, don't.

2063
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,880
You know, you don't actually have to do this.

2064
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:19,440
Hanstein and Murray's second defense is even more telling than the first.

2065
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,800
Our principle was to explore additional dynamics

2066
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,480
when there was another factor that was not only conceivably important,

2067
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:29,440
but for clear logical reasons might be important

2068
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:32,800
because of dynamics having little or nothing to do with IQ.

2069
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:35,440
This last proviso is crucial,

2070
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,560
for one of the most common misuses of regression analysis

2071
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,800
is to introduce an additional variable

2072
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:46,800
that in reality is mostly another expression of variables that are already in the equation.

2073
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,320
So what Hanstein and Murray are saying is that they dismissed variables

2074
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:54,480
if they deemed them to merely be mostly expressions of IQ,

2075
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,640
which is already in the equation.

2076
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,440
They only considered additional factors

2077
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,760
when they had little or nothing to do with IQ

2078
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:04,560
and were, quote, conceivably important.

2079
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,480
Which should lead us to ask a question.

2080
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:11,520
How are Hanstein and Murray deciding which variables are conceivably important?

2081
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,880
And how are they deciding how much they have to do with IQ?

2082
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,000
And the answer, of course, is subjectively.

2083
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,240
They're only considering things that they reckon are important.

2084
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:25,440
You see, the problem with Hanstein and Murray dismissing variables

2085
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:30,400
that they have subjectively decided are merely expressions of cognitive ability here

2086
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:36,000
is that they think that socioeconomic status itself is an expression of cognitive ability.

2087
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:41,200
Later in the book, when criticizing the practice of controlling for SES between racial groups,

2088
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:41,920
they write,

2089
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:47,040
the difficulty comes in interpreting what it means to control for socioeconomic status.

2090
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,320
Matching the status of the groups is usually justified on the grounds

2091
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:55,440
that the scores people earn are caused to some extent by their socioeconomic status.

2092
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:59,360
So if we want to see the real or authentic difference between them,

2093
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:02,240
the contribution of status must be excluded.

2094
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:07,600
The trouble is that socioeconomic status is also a result of cognitive ability,

2095
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,680
as people of high and low cognitive ability

2096
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:13,760
move to correspondingly high and low places in the socioeconomic continuum.

2097
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,000
Now, this is circular logic.

2098
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,840
Hanstein and Murray claim to be limiting which factors they're considering

2099
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:24,240
to avoid including those which are merely expressions of other factors,

2100
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:29,600
but their main comparison here is between cognitive ability and socioeconomic status,

2101
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:33,760
which they elsewhere argue is a result of cognitive ability.

2102
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:40,000
Using this framework, where cognitive ability determines both IQ and socioeconomic status,

2103
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,120
the whole series of comparisons from this chapter of the bell curve

2104
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:45,440
seems cynical and unnecessary.

2105
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:50,000
Hanstein and Murray have already decided what conclusion they're gonna come to,

2106
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,080
that cognitive ability is more important than all the other variables,

2107
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:58,240
and all their statistical comparisons read as them just going through the motions

2108
01:55:58,240 --> 01:55:59,680
to get that result.

2109
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:04,880
In simply declaring socioeconomic status the result of cognitive ability,

2110
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,720
the bell curve brings to mind the chicken and egg problem here.

2111
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:11,440
You see, a lot of disagreements over IQ

2112
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:14,960
stem from different interpretations of the same data.

2113
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:18,320
Let's say you do a study which proves a strong positive correlation

2114
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:22,720
between the amount of time someone has spent in education and their IQ,

2115
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:25,840
and you present those findings to two groups of people.

2116
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:28,720
One group that favors environmental explanations

2117
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:31,600
and one that favors genetic explanations.

2118
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:34,720
Now, of course, the environmentalists will say,

2119
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:36,960
this result makes perfect sense.

2120
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,840
The longer you're in education, the more things you learn,

2121
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,920
the better you get at answering the sorts of questions that show up on IQ tests,

2122
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:48,080
the more familiar you are with taking academic tests in the first place.

2123
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:51,200
IQ clearly stems from environment.

2124
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:54,240
The genetic-minded folks, on the other hand, will say,

2125
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:57,280
of course, this result makes perfect sense.

2126
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:00,480
People with higher IQs favor an academic environment,

2127
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,800
and they're more likely to stay in school longer

2128
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:05,200
because that's the smarter thing to do.

2129
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:07,680
Since they have higher IQs to begin with,

2130
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:09,920
they will naturally make better choices.

2131
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:13,280
Environment clearly stems from IQ.

2132
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:16,560
So which came first, the chicken or the egg?

2133
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,800
Environment or cognitive ability?

2134
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,800
We can phrase this two ways.

2135
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,320
A parent's higher cognitive ability leads to a better environment,

2136
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:28,080
which again leads to a higher cognitive ability in their children.

2137
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,240
Or we can say that a better environment

2138
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,560
leads to a parent's higher cognitive ability,

2139
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:35,920
which then produces a better environment for their children.

2140
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,720
But both of these ways of phrasing are merely presenting

2141
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:43,600
a segment of the overall environment-cognitive ability logic chain.

2142
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:46,160
The bell curve solves the conundrum of whether

2143
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:49,360
cognitive ability or environment should come first by saying...

2144
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,200
cognitive ability.

2145
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:52,720
That's first.

2146
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:56,080
We like that one the most, so that's the one that comes first.

2147
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,480
But of course, this is completely arbitrary,

2148
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:01,440
and also, ultimately, incorrect.

2149
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,120
To understand this, we need to talk about another of the main problems

2150
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:08,000
with the scientific arguments of the bell curve,

2151
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,920
which is that Herrnstein and Murray are conspicuously uninterested

2152
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,880
in the causes of the things that they're talking about.

2153
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,720
Much of the bell curve, for instance, is concerned with proving

2154
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:21,840
that there are substantial differences in cognitive ability

2155
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,400
between different designated racial groups.

2156
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:28,160
But what Herrnstein and Murray never seriously concern themselves with

2157
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:31,120
is why this supposed divergence happened.

2158
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:35,520
Population groups don't evolve to be different for no reason, do they?

2159
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,960
If one group developed better cognitive skills than another group,

2160
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,960
there would have to be some mechanism there

2161
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:44,400
that was leading to higher cognitive ability in that group,

2162
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:48,240
or, I suppose, leading to lower cognitive ability in the other group.

2163
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:51,280
Now, this could simply be direct evolutionary pressure,

2164
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:54,320
as in different levels of cognitive ability in different groups

2165
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,800
are being directly selected for.

2166
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,520
Or it could be an indirect, unintended effect

2167
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,680
of a different trait being selected for,

2168
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,840
or some sort of genetic drift,

2169
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,320
as generations of different population groups

2170
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,320
are isolated enough from each other

2171
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:11,360
to develop in significantly different ways.

2172
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:15,120
Whatever the reason, though, there would have to be a reason.

2173
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:18,080
And we should expect a scientist attempting to argue

2174
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:21,360
for a substantial difference in ability between different groups

2175
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:26,560
to therefore maybe be interested in exactly why this difference came about, right?

2176
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:29,520
One of the only times that Herrnstein and Murray

2177
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,440
show any interest in this question

2178
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:33,920
is in Appendix Five, where they discuss the work

2179
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:37,200
of Canadian psychologist J. Philippe Rushton,

2180
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:41,760
who wrote the book Race, Evolution, and Behavior in 1995.

2181
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:46,720
Rushton alleges that brain and genital size are inversely related,

2182
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:50,800
and that larger genitals correlate with an increased fertility.

2183
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:55,280
So at some point, different designated racial groups diverged from one another

2184
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:59,760
and developed different traits according to some sort of trade-off system.

2185
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:02,560
So it's like a computer game where you have limited points

2186
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,240
to put into your starting stats,

2187
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:08,640
only here the starting stats are int and genital size.

2188
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:14,400
In 1988, Rushton was reprimanded by the University of Western Ontario

2189
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,120
for carrying out two particular studies.

2190
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:19,760
He surveyed first-year psychology students

2191
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,960
and then male customers at a Toronto shopping mall,

2192
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:25,600
asking them questions about their sex lives,

2193
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,440
the size of their penises,

2194
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:30,560
and the exact distance that they ejaculate.

2195
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:34,000
Now, I can only speak for myself here,

2196
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,640
but I can't say I've ever measured.

2197
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:42,080
One therefore wonders how reliable this self-reported data could be.

2198
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,760
Or, who knows, maybe I'm the anomaly here.

2199
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:50,320
Maybe all you penis-havers out there are keeping detailed daily statistics.

2200
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:51,360
I don't know.

2201
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:57,200
One also wonders about exactly how distance is supposed to come into play here.

2202
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,200
For want of a better phrase.

2203
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:03,680
What does this Rushton guy think is going on in the bedroom?

2204
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:07,280
Does he think you have to hit a moving target or something?

2205
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:07,840
I don't know.

2206
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:12,480
Rushton's work also uses the same caucasoid, mongoloid,

2207
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:15,680
negroid categorization that Richard Limb uses.

2208
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:17,920
And to quote a response to Rushton's theories

2209
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,480
by Canadian psychologist Zach Cenovsky,

2210
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:24,000
some of Rushton's references to scientific literature

2211
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,200
with respects to racial differences and sexual characteristics

2212
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:32,480
turned out to be references to a non-scientific semi-pornographic book

2213
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:35,120
and to an article in the penthouse forum.

2214
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:39,280
I am mentioning Rushton and his weird genital theories here,

2215
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:42,640
not just because they're funny to relate, which they certainly are,

2216
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:46,640
but because he and his research are defended in the bell curve.

2217
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:49,760
Herrnstein and Murray relay his ideas before stating,

2218
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:59,920
However, Rushton's work is not that of a crackpot or a bigot,

2219
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:02,320
as many of his critics are given to charging.

2220
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,720
But they're wrong there, of course.

2221
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:07,280
He is a crackpot and a bigot.

2222
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:09,760
Or he was, anyway. He's dead now.

2223
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,960
As for why Herrnstein and Murray seem so disinterested

2224
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:16,160
in examining causes for the things that they're discussing,

2225
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:17,920
I can only speculate here.

2226
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:22,080
But I suspect it's because, at least with regards to the bell curve, anyway,

2227
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:25,280
Herrnstein and Murray are not scientists.

2228
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:30,080
They didn't even submit the bell curve for peer review prior to its publication.

2229
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:34,240
They are here to advance a conservative social and political agenda,

2230
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:39,280
and all the air quotes science is just window dressing for that agenda.

2231
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,520
And that's what we're going to talk about next.

2232
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,560
So then, the politics of the bell curve.

2233
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:49,920
And I'd like to first talk a bit more about why the bell curve was so controversial.

2234
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:55,520
And there's one main reason comprised of two, uh, sub reasons.

2235
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:59,520
The first is that Herrnstein and Murray spend a large part of their book

2236
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:04,080
asserting differences in intelligence between designated racial groups.

2237
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,800
And we have to wonder why they even did this,

2238
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:09,840
because it isn't important at all for their overall point.

2239
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:14,080
Their main argument is that IQ is the most important factor

2240
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:16,400
determining success or failure in life,

2241
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:20,080
and they seemingly don't need the racial element at all to make this point.

2242
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:21,920
Or do they?

2243
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:26,480
In a section titled How Ethnic Differences Fit Into the Story,

2244
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:27,920
they write the following.

2245
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:31,920
In part one, we described the formation of a cognitive elite.

2246
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:35,040
Given the cognitive differences among ethnic and racial groups,

2247
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:38,560
the cognitive elite cannot represent all groups equally,

2248
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:41,920
a statement with implications that we will develop in part four.

2249
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:47,040
Part four being the section of the book comprised of their policy proposals,

2250
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:51,040
and it is these policy proposals that are the second part of the reason

2251
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:54,080
for the bell curve being such a controversial book.

2252
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:58,000
More than either of these things individually being controversial,

2253
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,920
it's how they interact that really produces the controversy.

2254
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:06,000
You see, for all Herrnstein and Murray's posturing about how brave they're being,

2255
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,640
speaking out and breaking taboos and all that,

2256
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:12,240
it is not actually controversial in the scientific community

2257
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:15,920
to simply acknowledge group differences in IQ.

2258
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,000
Let's imagine that instead of the bell curve,

2259
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,080
Herrnstein and Murray had simply published a list of IQ test results

2260
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:24,960
showing differences in IQ in different countries.

2261
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:27,280
Nobody would have cared.

2262
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:29,600
Researchers from across the political spectrum

2263
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:32,560
work with intelligence test data all the time.

2264
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:34,640
Some environment-minded researchers,

2265
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:37,840
because they acknowledge that the group differences exist,

2266
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:40,720
but they want to prove that environmental factors

2267
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:42,560
are the key to understanding them.

2268
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:46,720
Nor is it controversial to assert that differences in cognitive ability

2269
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:49,680
in general are partially due to genetics.

2270
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:55,040
There are a whole host of genetic conditions that can affect someone's cognitive ability.

2271
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:58,160
Right-wingers who characterize lefties as die-hard,

2272
02:04:58,160 --> 02:05:01,520
100% environmentalists miss the point here,

2273
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:04,400
as we'd actually be hasty to point out the ableism

2274
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:07,360
in denying the effects of those genetic conditions.

2275
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:11,920
So it's not simply that Herrnstein and Murray are breaking the supposed taboo

2276
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,840
of discussing IQ differences that sparked the backlash.

2277
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:21,200
It's that they explicitly link those differences to a set of policy proposals.

2278
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:26,400
This is why the bell curve is controversial, because of its political ideas.

2279
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,840
So let's talk about those.

2280
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,880
First off, the enormous glaring problem

2281
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:34,560
with the vast majority of Herrnstein and Murray's policy proposals

2282
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,680
is that they absolutely do not logically follow

2283
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:40,640
from any of their previous claims in the bell curve.

2284
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:45,200
And if it sounds like I'm exaggerating there, trust me, I am not.

2285
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:48,640
Take, for instance, their account of programs like Head Start

2286
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:51,280
that are designed to help disadvantaged kids.

2287
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:54,480
Herrnstein and Murray acknowledge that these programs

2288
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:56,960
can have temporary positive effects,

2289
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:00,480
but they argue that these positive effects fade over time

2290
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:05,280
and become statistically insignificant by the time those children leave school.

2291
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,600
This is taken by Herrnstein and Murray as proof

2292
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:11,200
that there is ultimately nothing to be done to help these kids.

2293
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:14,800
Any temporary positive effects will simply fade away

2294
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:17,200
due to their inferior genetics.

2295
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,440
So we should stop wasting money on them

2296
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:22,800
and instead give it to the naturally gifted children.

2297
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,800
This does not follow, however.

2298
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:27,760
There is an alternative interpretation of this situation,

2299
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:29,360
which is perfectly consistent

2300
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:33,440
with a majority environmental understanding of childhood development.

2301
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:37,120
We can argue that these programs produce a positive effect

2302
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:40,320
because they are changing the children's environment.

2303
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:43,520
Any diminished effects after the programs stop

2304
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:46,080
are because the programs stopped,

2305
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:49,360
thus changing the environment back to the norm.

2306
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,520
So instead of abandoning these programs,

2307
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:53,040
we should instead take them as proof

2308
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:56,880
that environmental changes can produce positive effects

2309
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:00,480
and then expand them, increase their funding,

2310
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:04,080
have equivalent programs for every stage of school life.

2311
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:08,240
Any later diminished effects are proof that we aren't trying hard enough,

2312
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:11,280
not that what we're trying to do is impossible.

2313
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,920
Nearly every policy proposal in the bell curve

2314
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:17,200
has this sort of alternative explanation.

2315
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:21,760
One of their proposals for dissuading low IQ mothers from having children

2316
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:25,040
is to stop the welfare programs that support them.

2317
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:28,720
But as we know, richer people tend to have fewer children,

2318
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:33,120
and birth rates are lower in countries with comprehensive welfare programs.

2319
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:37,680
Making these women poorer will not make them have fewer children.

2320
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:40,160
And besides, Hernstein and Murray are arguing

2321
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:43,120
that these women are resolutely unintelligent.

2322
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:44,320
So if that were true,

2323
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:47,520
why would we be expecting them to be able to plan ahead

2324
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:51,360
and reason logically that having fewer children is a good idea?

2325
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:54,320
That they're not supposed to be able to plan well for the future

2326
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:56,000
is kind of the whole point, right?

2327
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,480
What Hernstein and Murray could have done here

2328
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:03,120
is some very basic comparisons between the United States and other countries.

2329
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:06,640
They scaremonger about the possible effects of welfare programs

2330
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:09,760
which exist in Europe in abundance, for instance.

2331
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,160
But since those European welfare programs

2332
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:14,720
have not led to the sort of utter catastrophe

2333
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:16,720
that Hernstein and Murray prophesize,

2334
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:20,400
they instead choose to focus only on the United States.

2335
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:22,880
Even if Hernstein and Murray had proven

2336
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:26,320
that some groups were genetically less intelligent than others,

2337
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:29,040
cutting welfare would not follow from that.

2338
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:33,360
Rather, one could make the argument that those groups would deserve more welfare

2339
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:37,440
because they would have an unfair disadvantage in school and in work

2340
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:39,440
that would not be their fault.

2341
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:43,520
And even worse than Hernstein and Murray's logic simply not following,

2342
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:49,600
their proposals sometimes actually directly contradict with their previous analysis.

2343
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:52,800
For example, let's talk about affirmative action.

2344
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:57,520
As mentioned earlier, Hernstein and Murray really don't like affirmative action.

2345
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:00,000
And as we've also seen, they are very worried

2346
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,920
about the supposed cognitive stratification of society.

2347
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:06,320
And let's briefly quote them talking about that.

2348
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:09,440
In this penultimate chapter, we speculate about the impact

2349
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:13,120
of cognitive stratification on American life and government.

2350
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:15,920
Predicting the course of society is chancy,

2351
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,280
but certain tendencies seem strong enough to worry about.

2352
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:22,160
An increasingly isolated cognitive elite,

2353
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:24,960
a merging of the cognitive elite with the affluent,

2354
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:27,680
a deteriorating quality of life for people

2355
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:30,960
at the bottom end of the cognitive ability distribution.

2356
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:35,760
Unchecked, these trends will lead the US towards something resembling a caste society

2357
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:38,560
with the underclass mired ever more firmly at the bottom

2358
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:41,840
and the cognitive elite ever more firmly anchored at the top,

2359
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:43,920
restructuring the rules of society

2360
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:47,040
so that it becomes harder and harder for them to lose.

2361
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:49,760
Among the other casualties of this process

2362
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:53,360
would be American civil society as we have known it.

2363
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:58,720
Like other apocalyptic visions, this one is pessimistic, perhaps too much so.

2364
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:01,680
On the other hand, there is much to be pessimistic about.

2365
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:04,960
Now what Hernstein and Murray fail to spot here

2366
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:07,920
is that a policy of aggressive affirmative action

2367
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:11,360
would directly work to check the cognitive partitioning

2368
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:13,760
that they call frightening and apocalyptic.

2369
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,480
If Harvard or some other fancy school

2370
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:19,680
decided they were gonna admit a certain percentage of applicants

2371
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:23,360
based upon some characteristic other than test scores,

2372
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:26,800
then there would be that same number of applicants with higher test scores

2373
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,040
who would therefore not get into Harvard

2374
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:31,920
and have to go to their next choice of college.

2375
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:35,200
And the next smartest people who would have gone to that college

2376
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:38,240
will now not get in and have to go to their next choice

2377
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:40,080
and so on down the line.

2378
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:42,560
And if this ruthless affirmative action policy

2379
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:45,280
was adopted by the group of colleges as a whole,

2380
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,680
the cognitive elite would be forced to spread out

2381
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:49,520
throughout the whole college pool,

2382
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:53,920
which would have the added effect of spreading them out geographically too.

2383
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:56,640
Hernstein and Murray really should have spotted this,

2384
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:59,040
since earlier in the book they talk fondly

2385
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:02,240
about Harvard's policy of admitting legacy applicants,

2386
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:06,080
those usually being people whose fathers had graduated from Harvard.

2387
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:09,520
They also mention applicants being considered for things like

2388
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:13,840
his potential as a quarterback or stroke for the eight-man shell

2389
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,640
and other non-academic qualities.

2390
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:19,920
Curiously, Hernstein and Murray do not criticize

2391
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:24,080
Harvard's practice of admitting people for non-academic reasons.

2392
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:26,560
When it comes to affirmative action, however,

2393
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:30,640
Hernstein and Murray are very clear about that being unfair,

2394
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:31,520
and I quote,

2395
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:34,000
"...to what extent is a society fair

2396
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,400
when people of similar ability and background

2397
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:38,800
are treated as differently as they are now?"

2398
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:42,640
In 1964, the answer would have been unambiguous.

2399
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:45,680
Such a society is manifestly unfair.

2400
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:48,560
The logic was right then, and right now.

2401
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:52,080
So colleges admitting applicants for non-academic reasons,

2402
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:55,120
such as their father having gone there, that's okay.

2403
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:59,760
It's counteracting the dreaded cognitive partitioning of society, after all.

2404
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:03,200
But colleges admitting applicants because of affirmative action,

2405
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:05,440
well that is, rather dramatically,

2406
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:08,320
leaking a poison into the American soul.

2407
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,680
So how do we account for this apparent contradiction

2408
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:13,920
on behalf of Hernstein and Murray?

2409
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:17,360
Well, what would you imagine to be the most likely difference

2410
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:22,480
between a legacy Harvard applicant and an affirmative action applicant?

2411
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:26,000
I will leave it to you to ponder that one.

2412
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:30,320
Instead of the unfair and poisonous racial affirmative action,

2413
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:34,960
Hernstein and Murray argue instead for a race-blind version of affirmative action

2414
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:38,480
based, bizarrely, on test scores.

2415
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:42,720
And I say bizarrely here because this idea would actually accelerate

2416
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:46,160
the supposedly apocalyptic cognitive partitioning.

2417
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:49,040
They say that in the case of two candidates

2418
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:51,040
who are fairly closely matched otherwise,

2419
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:55,520
universities should give the nod to the applicant from the disadvantaged background.

2420
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:58,160
Now, I agree with this in isolation here.

2421
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:00,880
I do think that if you have two similar candidates,

2422
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:03,120
you should admit the less privileged one.

2423
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:07,600
But with regards to Hernstein and Murray's fears of cognitive partitioning, though,

2424
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:10,320
this is exactly what they were worried about.

2425
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:15,120
College is becoming better at collecting all of society's high IQ people together

2426
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:19,520
and funneling them into high IQ jobs in high IQ areas.

2427
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:20,720
They've basically said,

2428
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:25,680
here's an apocalyptic problem and now here's how to make it happen faster.

2429
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:29,360
And actually, regarding the concept of affirmative action,

2430
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:31,840
their logic is all wrong there.

2431
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:36,320
At the start of the chapter titled Affirmative Action in Higher Education,

2432
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:41,200
Hernstein and Murray recount an affirmative action controversy from 1991

2433
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:44,320
where a law student at Georgetown University, quote,

2434
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:47,040
surreptitiously compiled the entrance statistics

2435
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:49,840
for a sample of applicants to Georgetown's law school

2436
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:54,400
and then published the results of his research in the law school student newspaper.

2437
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:57,920
He revealed that the mean on the law school aptitude test

2438
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:02,720
differed by a large margin for accepted black and white students.

2439
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:04,720
Hernstein and Murray dubbed this difference

2440
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:08,640
the ethnic premium or edge that minority applicants

2441
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:12,080
are supposedly being afforded in the admissions process

2442
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:15,440
and go on to detail how they've looked at the college admissions data

2443
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:21,360
from 26 colleges and found that in the classes entering those in 1991 and 92,

2444
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:24,080
the average SAT scores of the black students

2445
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:27,760
were below the average SAT scores of the white students.

2446
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,760
Hernstein and Murray take this as proof

2447
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:34,080
that black students have an unfair edge in the college admissions process.

2448
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:38,720
Quote, the summary statement about affirmative action in undergraduate institutions

2449
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:41,680
is that being either a black or a Latino

2450
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:44,240
is worth a great deal in the admissions process

2451
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:48,080
at every undergraduate school for which we have data.

2452
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:52,720
However, this method of measuring the supposed results of affirmative action

2453
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:54,720
is entirely incorrect.

2454
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:57,680
There is a crucial flaw in the logic here

2455
02:14:57,680 --> 02:15:01,600
and it begins with Hernstein and Murray's decision to begin their analysis

2456
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:05,840
by looking at the college entrance data instead of earlier

2457
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:09,600
by thinking about the wider pool of college applicants.

2458
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:14,160
So black people have historically had lower SAT scores than white people.

2459
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:19,360
Now whether you believe this is due to some fixed genetically originated lower IQ

2460
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:22,960
or you're sensible and you believe it's down to environmental reasons,

2461
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,240
it is the case.

2462
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:28,960
So in any random group of students applying to a college in the United States,

2463
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:33,040
we would expect the scores of the black students to be on average

2464
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:35,600
lower than the white students if you follow.

2465
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:39,520
So what happens next is the college takes a look at this group of applicants

2466
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:43,840
and decides to omit some of them using certain criteria.

2467
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:46,640
So test scores but usually various other things

2468
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:49,840
like extracurricular activities and whatever else.

2469
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:52,320
So all the accepted students get in

2470
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:56,320
and all the denied students go off to apply somewhere else, right?

2471
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:58,720
Then Hernstein and Murray come along to the college

2472
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:01,440
and they notice that the scores of the black students

2473
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:03,680
are on average below the white students

2474
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:08,080
and thus start decrying the terrible unfairness of affirmative action.

2475
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:10,640
But what they've missed here is that this discrepancy

2476
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:13,920
between the average black and white scores would still exist

2477
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:19,040
even if the college admissions process only considered test scores and nothing else.

2478
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:20,640
And let's think about this.

2479
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:23,920
Imagine an American college in 1991

2480
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:26,560
with a certain amount of positions to fill

2481
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:31,040
and they get a larger group of students applying for those positions, right?

2482
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:34,160
So they have to let some in and not others.

2483
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:37,760
In that group of applicants there will be a range of test scores

2484
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:42,720
and the black applicants will have on average lower scores than the white applicants.

2485
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:46,240
And let's say this college only admits people via test scores

2486
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:49,200
so if they have 1,000 positions to fill

2487
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:54,800
they only accept the top 1,000 SAT scores and they send everyone else packing.

2488
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:58,240
Now in this group of 1,000 successful applicants

2489
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:00,960
there will still be both black and white people

2490
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:04,400
but of those black people who scored high enough to get in

2491
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:08,480
they will be on average towards the lower end of the range.

2492
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:12,640
Meaning the black group average will still be lower than the white group average

2493
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:16,000
even though they all scored high enough to get in.

2494
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,320
Even in a world without affirmative action

2495
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:21,600
and even with a totally racially blind admissions policy

2496
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:25,680
and accepting Hearnstein and Murray's positions regarding racial IQ scores

2497
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:31,520
a disparity between black and white SAT scores in college intake groups would still exist.

2498
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:35,600
The only way we could fairly expect the two averages to be the same

2499
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:39,680
is if the black and white students in that 1991 applicant pool

2500
02:17:39,680 --> 02:17:42,800
also had on average the same scores.

2501
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:46,640
And since Hearnstein and Murray have just spent a huge section of their book

2502
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:49,760
arguing for black people's lower cognitive ability

2503
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:52,400
I don't know why they'd be expecting that.

2504
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:55,920
Moving on from affirmative action I'd like to ask a question.

2505
02:17:56,560 --> 02:18:01,040
Can the politics of the bell curve be described as eugenics?

2506
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:02,960
And I mean yes, right?

2507
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:06,800
They're arguing for policies with the agenda of changing birth rates

2508
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:08,800
for particular groups of people.

2509
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:12,320
They want lower IQ mothers to have fewer children.

2510
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:16,800
Hearnstein and Murray stop short of openly embracing eugenics however.

2511
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:21,360
They pull a rhetorical trick by saying they're simply worried about dysgenics.

2512
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:24,080
Dysgenics being the opposite of eugenics there.

2513
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:29,120
So we're not necessarily for it but we are anti the opposite of it.

2514
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:30,240
You know, it's very clever.

2515
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:36,320
One telling quote here is when Hearnstein and Murray talking about the Nazis say the following

2516
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:40,560
followed by the terrors of Nazism and its perversion of eugenics

2517
02:18:40,560 --> 02:18:44,000
that effectively wiped the idea from public discourse in the West.

2518
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:49,760
Now the phrase perversion of eugenics should set off some alarm bells there

2519
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:53,120
implying apparently that there is a good sort of eugenics

2520
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:57,520
and the Nazis just did it wrong or took it too far or something.

2521
02:18:57,520 --> 02:19:02,240
Or maybe there was just something uniquely evil about Nazi eugenics

2522
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:05,920
that wasn't present in the supposedly good eugenics.

2523
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:06,800
Is that true?

2524
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:09,280
Well, let's find out.

2525
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:13,440
The footage you're seeing here is from a movie called Herb Crank.

2526
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:16,000
In English, the Hereditary Defective.

2527
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:22,400
This is a 1936 propaganda film produced by the Nazi party's racial policy office.

2528
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:25,600
It features video shots at German psychiatric hospitals

2529
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:28,320
of people with various types of disabilities

2530
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:31,840
interspersed with text informing the audience, among other things,

2531
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:34,640
of the expense of caring for these people.

2532
02:19:34,640 --> 02:19:40,480
Going on to argue that the prevention of hereditarily sick offspring is a moral duty.

2533
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:43,840
Now I'm not actually showing the images of the people in the video here

2534
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:46,800
as they almost certainly did not consent to be in a film

2535
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:50,480
which was used to propagandize in favor of their sterilization

2536
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:53,920
and I would feel uncomfortable including that footage in my video.

2537
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:58,720
Herb Crank is available online though if you prefer to watch it unedited.

2538
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:00,240
The film ends with the quote,

2539
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:05,120
the farmer who prevents the overgrowth of the weed promotes the valuable.

2540
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:09,120
The purpose of this film was obviously to increase public support

2541
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:12,880
for the involuntary sterilization of people with disabilities,

2542
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:17,600
a Nazi program that would escalate into outright mass murder just a few years later.

2543
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:20,480
Adolf Hitler was reportedly a fan of Herb Crank

2544
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:22,960
and encouraged the production of a sequel titled

2545
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:26,960
Victims of the Past, The Sin Against Blood and Race

2546
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:31,040
which was shown in cinemas throughout Nazi Germany in 1937.

2547
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:34,320
So why am I talking about Herb Crank here?

2548
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:37,840
Is this simply a slippery slope argument perhaps?

2549
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:42,160
Look where all this eugenics rubbish leads to the Nazis and the Holocaust.

2550
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:46,240
Now although I think that would be a fair point to make actually,

2551
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:52,160
no this particular movie has a much more direct link to what we're talking about today.

2552
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:54,160
Now something that might come as a shock to you

2553
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:57,840
and it certainly did to me in the process of researching this video

2554
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:02,640
is the extent of the international eugenics movement prior to World War II.

2555
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,640
Nazi eugenicists were not operating in a bubble

2556
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:10,400
and most importantly for us here is that they had a reciprocal relationship

2557
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:12,080
with American eugenicists.

2558
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:16,240
You see Herb Crank had another big fan in addition to Hitler.

2559
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:21,040
So this guy is Harry H. Loughlin, an American eugenicist,

2560
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:23,520
director of the Eugenics Record Office

2561
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:27,680
and founding member of the American Eugenics Society.

2562
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:30,240
He likes eugenics if you didn't pick up on that.

2563
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:34,080
Now in 1922 Harry Loughlin published a book titled

2564
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:36,960
Eugenical Sterilization in the United States

2565
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:41,840
which included a chapter titled Model Eugenical Sterilization Law.

2566
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:43,360
This model law begins

2567
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:49,600
an act to prevent the procreation of persons socially inadequate from defective inheritance

2568
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:53,440
by authorizing and providing for the eugenical sterilization

2569
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:58,400
of certain potential parents carrying degenerate hereditary qualities.

2570
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:01,520
This law designates a socially inadequate person

2571
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:06,400
as someone who fails chronically in comparison with normal persons

2572
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:08,560
to maintain himself or herself

2573
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:12,560
as a useful member of the organized social life of the state.

2574
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:16,000
These socially inadequate people were not just the ill

2575
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:21,200
but also for example the criminalistic, the inebriate and the dependent

2576
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:27,360
including orphans, ne'er-do-wells, the homeless, tramps and paupers.

2577
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:30,800
18 US states passed laws based upon Loughlin's model

2578
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:34,320
and between them sterilized tens of thousands of people.

2579
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:40,560
And in 1933 somewhere else passed a law which was based upon Loughlin's model.

2580
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:44,480
The law for the prevention of hereditarily diseased offspring

2581
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:48,320
which actually was slightly more moderate than what the model law proposed

2582
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:49,600
if you can believe it.

2583
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:52,320
This was of course Nazi Germany.

2584
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:56,960
Loughlin was later awarded an honorary degree by the University of Heidelberg

2585
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:59,120
for his work on behalf of the quote,

2586
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:01,360
science of racial cleansing.

2587
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:04,640
Loughlin was also an open Nazi party supporter

2588
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:08,080
writing enthusiastically about Nazi Germany's eugenics laws

2589
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:11,200
in a publication titled Eugenic News.

2590
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:14,080
And why shouldn't he be excited about them?

2591
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:15,680
I mean, he wrote them.

2592
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:18,960
In addition to inspiring Nazi party policy

2593
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:22,560
Loughlin also helped to disseminate their propaganda.

2594
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:27,040
In 1936 he purchased an English translation of Erbcrank

2595
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:30,880
and raised funds to have it shown in American high schools,

2596
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:32,080
which it was.

2597
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:34,880
That's right, just a couple of years before the Nazis

2598
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:38,480
started systematically murdering people with disabilities

2599
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:42,560
this Nazi eugenics movie was actually shown in American schools

2600
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:46,480
and this event was reported on favorably in the Nazi press.

2601
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:49,120
Loughlin raised the funds to distribute the film

2602
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:51,600
by writing to Wycliffe Draper

2603
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:54,560
who was another American eugenicist and racist

2604
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:57,760
and importantly for Loughlin, a millionaire.

2605
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:02,880
Together in 1937 Loughlin and Draper founded the Pioneer Fund

2606
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:07,520
the purpose of which was to promote the genetic stock of people quote,

2607
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:11,440
deemed to be descended predominantly from white persons

2608
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:16,640
who settled in the original 13 states prior to the adoption of the constitution.

2609
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:20,720
Now besides subjecting school children to Nazi propaganda

2610
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:24,560
the Pioneer Fund set about supporting massive air quotes

2611
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:27,360
research into race betterment

2612
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:33,040
giving enormous grants to any researcher willing to push a pro-eugenics agenda

2613
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:37,680
and here, dear video watchers, is where we rejoin the bell curve.

2614
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:41,600
Richard Lin, you remember, the guy who thinks the single best study

2615
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:46,160
of the quote, negroid intelligence was carried out under apartheid.

2616
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:50,720
He's received over $600,000 from the Pioneer Fund

2617
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:56,320
and currently, as in now, currently today, is the head of the Pioneer Fund

2618
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:59,440
because it is still going and he is still alive.

2619
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:03,040
Mankind Quarterly, the journal which published Lin's work

2620
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:06,880
that is cited in the bell curve, is funded by the Pioneer Fund.

2621
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:11,120
Mankind Quarterly includes among its founders Henry Garrett

2622
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:15,120
an American psychologist who testified in favor of segregated schools

2623
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:17,520
during Brown versus Board of Education

2624
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:22,400
Corrado Gini, who was president of the Italian Genetics and Eugenics Society

2625
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:23,920
in Fascist Italy

2626
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:26,400
and Othmar Freiherr von Verschuer

2627
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:30,000
who was director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology

2628
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,880
Human Heredity and Eugenics in Nazi Germany

2629
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:35,280
was a member of the Nazi Party

2630
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:39,920
and, believe it or not, the mentor of Joseph Mengele.

2631
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:44,560
Joseph Mengele, of course, being the physician at the Auschwitz concentration camp

2632
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:48,960
infamous for performing human experimentation on the prisoners.

2633
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:53,840
During World War II, Mengele provided Verschuer with human remains from Auschwitz

2634
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:56,720
to use in his research into eugenics.

2635
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:59,920
That is who founded Mankind Quarterly.

2636
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:05,200
Editor of The New Republic, Charles Lane, writing about the bell curve in 1994

2637
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:09,440
noted that five articles from the journal, that's Mankind Quarterly,

2638
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:12,240
are actually cited in the bell curve's bibliography

2639
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:17,040
but the influence on the book from scholars linked to Mankind Quarterly is more significant.

2640
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:21,280
No fewer than 17 researchers cited in the bibliography of the bell curve

2641
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:23,680
have contributed to Mankind Quarterly.

2642
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:29,280
Ten are present or former editors or members of its editorial advisory board.

2643
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:34,640
J. Philippe Rushton, the guy wandering around asking people how far they can ejaculate

2644
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:38,880
he was president of the Pioneer Fund from 2002 to 2012

2645
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:41,760
received hundreds of thousands of dollars from it

2646
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:45,840
and he used Pioneer Funds to mail 40,000 copies of his book

2647
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:49,600
Race, Evolution and Behavior to various social scientists.

2648
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:54,240
Another Pioneer Fund recipient was American anthropologist Donald Swan.

2649
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:59,120
Now in 1966, Donald Swan was arrested on charges of mail fraud.

2650
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:01,600
When the police investigated Swan's apartment

2651
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:05,840
they found an assortment of illegal weapons, a stash of racist literature,

2652
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:08,960
Nazi memorabilia including flags and a helmet

2653
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:12,880
and photographs of Swan with members of the American Nazi Party.

2654
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:14,560
Oops.

2655
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:18,240
Do you remember Linda Gottfriedsen, the author of the public statement

2656
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:20,720
defending the bell curve's claims about intelligence

2657
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:23,680
that I mentioned way back at the start of the video?

2658
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:30,800
Well as of 1994, she'd received $267,000 from the Pioneer Fund.

2659
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:33,120
And speaking of that public statement actually,

2660
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:38,080
the Southern Poverty Law Center notes that more than 20 of the 52 signatories

2661
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:40,640
were themselves Pioneer Fund recipients.

2662
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:46,240
And crucially for us here, the Pioneer Fund wanted to fund Richard Herrnstein.

2663
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:51,360
The head of the fund prior to J. Philippe Rushton was a lawyer called Harry F. Weyer

2664
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:54,720
and in 1994, the year that the bell curve came out,

2665
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:58,320
he told a journalist interviewing him that regarding Herrnstein

2666
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:02,640
we'd have funded him at the drop of a hat but he never asked.

2667
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:05,680
Now the fact that the bell curve includes among its sources

2668
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:08,640
a bunch of people who receive money from the Nazi Fund

2669
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:11,040
and publish papers in the Nazi journal

2670
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:14,960
was understandably cause for concern for many when it was published

2671
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:18,720
and this was used frequently to dismiss the book's arguments.

2672
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:22,400
So Murray includes a very short defense of the Pioneer Fund

2673
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:25,920
in his afterword to the bell curve which reads as follows.

2674
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:30,080
The relationship between the founder of the Pioneer Fund and today's Pioneer Fund

2675
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:34,240
is roughly analogous to that between Henry Ford and today's Ford Foundation.

2676
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:38,720
So he's saying, you know, it may have been founded by pro-Nazi eugenicists

2677
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:40,640
but today it's completely different.

2678
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:45,840
The trouble is, Murray includes absolutely no evidence to back this statement up.

2679
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:47,760
He treats it as a given.

2680
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:53,760
But actually, the Pioneer Fund has been unwavering in its support for eugenics over the years.

2681
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:56,000
Richard Lynn, the current head of the fund,

2682
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,640
works with the explicitly white supremacist publication American Renaissance

2683
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:02,480
and speaks at their conferences.

2684
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:06,640
The white supremacist editor of American Renaissance, Jared Taylor,

2685
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:11,440
who viewers of my other videos will remember, is funded by the Pioneer Fund.

2686
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:15,440
So I don't buy Charles Murray just saying it has changed.

2687
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:18,480
He doesn't give evidence for why he thinks that

2688
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:21,120
and there is ample evidence against it.

2689
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:26,000
Anyway, it's about time to wrap this video up with a few final thoughts, I think.

2690
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:30,560
But let's first briefly summarize our main counter-arguments to the bell curve.

2691
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:34,320
Firstly, the bell curve does not prove that genetics are the primary reason

2692
02:29:34,320 --> 02:29:36,000
for differences in intelligence.

2693
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:40,720
The authors are not geneticists, they're a psychologist and a social scientist.

2694
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:45,680
Their estimates of the importance of genes are based on suppositions and guesses.

2695
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:49,840
After failing to make the case that IQ is genetic in origin,

2696
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:53,600
they compare that IQ not to one's social background,

2697
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:55,840
as the back cover of the book promises,

2698
02:29:55,840 --> 02:30:00,880
but a much more narrowly defined index of parental socioeconomic status,

2699
02:30:00,880 --> 02:30:04,400
which includes only a few of the relevant variables.

2700
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:09,120
The main source of their data is more a test of academic achievement than intelligence

2701
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:13,200
and since it did not return a normal bell curve distribution,

2702
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,600
Hernstein and Murray manipulated the data

2703
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:19,520
to exaggerate what were previously much smaller differences.

2704
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:24,480
After a completely unnecessary section making the case for racial IQ differences,

2705
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:26,880
they include a set of policy proposals,

2706
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:30,800
most of which do not follow logically from their previous analysis

2707
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:33,040
and some of which contradict it.

2708
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:37,360
And of course, Hernstein and Murray's willingness to quote highly questionable data

2709
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:41,520
from even more questionable sources should be very worrisome,

2710
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:44,640
even if you happen to agree with them otherwise.

2711
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:48,080
Having now read a lot of criticism of the bell curve,

2712
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:53,840
I think I've identified a particular difficulty that people have in arguing against it.

2713
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:59,120
And it's a tendency to argue with not the opinions that Hernstein and Murray claim to hold,

2714
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:02,000
but the opinions that they would have to hold

2715
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,360
in order to support the policy proposals which they do.

2716
02:31:05,360 --> 02:31:08,720
For example, it makes no sense to claim that IQ

2717
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:12,080
explains only a tiny amount of the variance between people

2718
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:15,120
and that you cannot know what someone will do from their IQ,

2719
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:16,880
as Hernstein and Murray do,

2720
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:19,840
and then move on to claim that IQ is one of the best ways

2721
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:23,120
of determining an employee's individual productivity

2722
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:26,960
and employers should pick applicants with the highest IQs.

2723
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:31,360
A passing critic of the bell curve who hears this latter claim might then respond,

2724
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:32,720
but that makes no sense.

2725
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:36,400
IQ explains only a tiny amount of the variance between people.

2726
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:39,440
You can't know what someone will do from their IQ.

2727
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:41,920
To which defenders of the bell curve respond,

2728
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:45,760
aha, you didn't read the book because they say that in there.

2729
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:49,840
Now this gotcha tactic, as satisfying as it might be,

2730
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:53,520
does not actually explain the contradiction, however.

2731
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:56,960
This is the main rhetorical trick of the bell curve.

2732
02:31:56,960 --> 02:32:01,200
They pretend to concede to mainstream scientific opinion,

2733
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:06,240
but then propose a set of conservative and eugenicist political policies

2734
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:07,600
as if they hadn't.

2735
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:12,320
Anyone who genuinely believed all the moderate hedging quotes

2736
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:14,800
that Hernstein and Murray put in the bell curve

2737
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:18,000
would not be able to propose the policies that they do.

2738
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:21,440
So the critics of the bell curve see these policies

2739
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:23,680
and start arguing against the opinions

2740
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:27,920
that they assume Hernstein and Murray would therefore have to hold.

2741
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:30,320
Thus the repeated defense of the bell curve

2742
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:34,080
is that the authors can't be racist or biased or bigoted,

2743
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:35,520
as their critics claim,

2744
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:39,200
because in their book they say that they're not.

2745
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:42,000
The critics must therefore have not read the book.

2746
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:45,840
This is not the airtight defense they think it is.

2747
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:48,640
We care about their political proposals,

2748
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:51,200
not how moderate they pretended to be

2749
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,520
in order to camouflage their approach to those political proposals.

2750
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:58,240
One could, if one wanted, go through my video

2751
02:32:58,240 --> 02:33:00,640
and find corresponding quotes in the bell curve

2752
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:03,040
for pretty much all of my counterarguments.

2753
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:07,360
See, they also worry about the dangers of social engineering.

2754
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:11,280
They also paraphrase Lewontin's thought experiment with the plants.

2755
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:14,720
They also talk about the various problems with IQ testing.

2756
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:18,000
They also call the existence of G arguable.

2757
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,160
They say all this in the book,

2758
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:21,840
so therefore they've addressed it

2759
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:25,360
and your counterarguments are nullified, right?

2760
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:28,240
The problem is, putting all that in the book

2761
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:32,800
didn't stop them from advocating for the political policies that they do,

2762
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:33,840
and it should have.

2763
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:37,600
If, with regards to how much genes influence intelligence,

2764
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:39,840
you spend a whole book saying things like

2765
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:43,360
the state of knowledge does not permit a precise estimate,

2766
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:45,920
but then you go on to propose a set of policies

2767
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:51,120
that only make sense if intelligence is definitely primarily genetic in origin,

2768
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:53,200
you are contradicting yourself.

2769
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:55,680
You don't actually care that the state of knowledge

2770
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:57,600
does not permit a precise estimate.

2771
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:01,280
That apparently isn't going to stop you from acting as if it does.

2772
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:05,120
I'm guilty myself of several times arguing against the point

2773
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:07,680
that Herrnstein and Murray should have made

2774
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:10,000
instead of the one that they did make.

2775
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,440
Only a minute ago I said

2776
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:13,600
the bell curve does not prove that genetics

2777
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:16,240
are the primary reason for differences in intelligence,

2778
02:34:16,240 --> 02:34:17,920
to which the offense is, of course,

2779
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:19,920
that they never set out to do such a thing.

2780
02:34:20,480 --> 02:34:21,840
But they should have.

2781
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:23,120
If you don't prove that,

2782
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:25,680
then the rest of the argument doesn't work.

2783
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:28,560
Now, they couldn't have proved that if they wanted to, of course,

2784
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:30,880
because the data is inconclusive.

2785
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:33,920
Herrnstein and Murray acknowledged the data is inconclusive,

2786
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:35,600
but then just keep on trucking,

2787
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:40,000
assuming firstly that later genetics research will prove them correct,

2788
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,960
which it hasn't.

2789
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:44,400
The data is still inconclusive 25 years later.

2790
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:48,320
And secondly, assuming that any data which trends against their position

2791
02:34:48,320 --> 02:34:51,200
is due to strictly temporary effects.

2792
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:53,680
Rising IQ scores are thus explained away

2793
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:57,440
as being due to an increase in test-taking ability or elsewhere,

2794
02:34:57,440 --> 02:35:00,320
as due to the data being distorted by the baby boom.

2795
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:04,560
Rising standards of living can raise a country's average IQ,

2796
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:07,120
but only to a point, it is assumed.

2797
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:09,760
Black and white IQ scores are converging,

2798
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:12,240
but they may be expected to stop,

2799
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:15,280
and the gap could even begin to widen again.

2800
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:19,520
So predicting the future on this issue is little more than guesswork at this point.

2801
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:22,720
All the trends that contradict what the authors of the bell curve

2802
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:26,960
would quite clearly like to be true are assumed to be time-limited.

2803
02:35:26,960 --> 02:35:29,520
You get the sense that Herrnstein and Murray are implying

2804
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:32,000
that once we get to the end of history,

2805
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:36,880
once things stop happening to make the data look like we're wrong,

2806
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:37,920
then you'll see.

2807
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:39,200
You'll all see.

2808
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:43,680
In just a few more years, you'll see that we were right all along.

2809
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:46,400
Of course, to a reader in 2019,

2810
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:48,720
all this, as with much of the rest of the book,

2811
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:50,880
comes off as rather quaint.

2812
02:35:50,880 --> 02:35:53,520
A relic of the 90s, maybe.

2813
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:54,560
Like pogs.

2814
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:58,320
You see, today, of course, we have social media

2815
02:35:58,320 --> 02:36:01,680
and daily get to see just how cognitively elite

2816
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:04,080
the supposed cognitive elite are.

2817
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:07,920
Herrnstein and Murray's theory of intellectual inequality

2818
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:12,400
is, of course, just economic inequality with the license plates changed.

2819
02:36:12,400 --> 02:36:14,640
And I can think of no better illustration of this

2820
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:18,480
than the college admissions bribery scandal from earlier this year.

2821
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:22,480
This was a criminal conspiracy organized by William Rick Singer

2822
02:36:22,480 --> 02:36:25,760
to doctor exam results and bribe college officials

2823
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:28,480
in order to ensure children of rich parents

2824
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:30,720
get into several top universities.

2825
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:35,440
Singer testified that he'd helped more than 750 families

2826
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:37,440
get children into college this way,

2827
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:41,120
and he furthermore claimed that some of the tactics he used to inflate test scores

2828
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:44,880
were widespread outside of his particular scheme.

2829
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:49,280
The problem, of course, is not that the rich are getting smarter,

2830
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,520
it's that the rich are getting richer

2831
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:54,960
and can increasingly rig the system to their own benefit.

2832
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:58,720
The fact that the rich definitely aren't cognitively elite

2833
02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:02,960
is increasingly becoming a problem, thanks to our imbalanced economies.

2834
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:07,040
In 2008, this cognitive elite caused an economic crash

2835
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:10,960
and had to be bailed out by all the middle bell curve average people.

2836
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:15,440
Lastly here, I'd like to say that the bell curve proves, if anything,

2837
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:18,720
that any apprehension the scientific community might have

2838
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:22,800
about discussing possible differences in racial cognitive ability

2839
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:25,200
would be very well justified.

2840
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:27,440
Because what you shouldn't want to happen,

2841
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:31,120
as a scientist presenting inconclusive evidence for such,

2842
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,080
is for someone hearing that inconclusive evidence

2843
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:36,880
to then start using it as a justification

2844
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:40,080
to propose eugenicist political policies.

2845
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:43,200
The bell curve is all this in one package.

2846
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:47,040
Inconclusive evidence and eugenicist politics.

2847
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:50,480
The bell curve has stuck around not because it breaks new ground

2848
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:51,920
or presents new ideas,

2849
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:55,760
but because it is a useful pseudo-scientific justification

2850
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:59,040
for conservatives looking to cut welfare programs

2851
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:03,200
and racists looking to feel justified in their racism.

2852
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:06,640
It is a scabrous piece of racial pornography.

2853
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:10,560
Thanks for watching, folks.

2854
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,800
This one took a bit of time to put together.

2855
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:16,320
I'm sure you've noticed.

2856
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,720
26,000 words, this is.

2857
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:22,080
Thank you, as always, to my patrons for supporting me

2858
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:25,760
so that I can keep making ridiculous videos like this one.

2859
02:38:26,320 --> 02:38:28,880
If you'd like to join this list of lovely people,

2860
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:31,520
I will put a link in the video description below

2861
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:33,760
that you can check out if you like.

2862
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:36,960
And I'd like to give an extra thank you to my patrons this time

2863
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:40,480
for fact-checking a previous draft of this video for me

2864
02:38:40,480 --> 02:38:43,120
and making some very useful suggestions.

2865
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:45,600
This video would not be half as good as it is

2866
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:47,680
without all of your excellent feedback,

2867
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:49,520
so I am very grateful for that.

2868
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:53,040
I'd also like to thank the people who were able to source

2869
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:55,920
a few difficult-to-find studies for me.

2870
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:59,440
Some folks were even kind enough to physically go and photograph

2871
02:38:59,440 --> 02:39:01,760
or scan things that were not available online,

2872
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:05,040
so thank you so much for helping me out there.

2873
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:08,400
Thank you also to the editors who helped me out with this video.

2874
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:11,760
Your contributions and suggestions were fantastic.

2875
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:13,440
Now, with any project of this length,

2876
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:17,120
you inevitably end up with a lot of unused material at the end,

2877
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:19,600
and there is so much that I left out here,

2878
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:21,280
usually for time reasons,

2879
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:23,760
because it would just take too long to explain,

2880
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:26,800
or because it was too complicated and beyond my ability

2881
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:29,520
to present the information in a way that made sense.

2882
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:33,600
If you'd like to look into the various subjects mentioned today

2883
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:35,760
in more depth than I do in the video,

2884
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:39,360
I would recommend checking out the sources and reading list below.

2885
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,320
Righty-ho, that's all from me today, folks.

2886
02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:43,920
I'll see you next time.
