0	3840	Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about The Bell Curve.
3840	10520	The Bell Curve is a 1994 book by psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Murray,
10520	15960	and by way of an introduction here, I'll read the description of the book that's on the back of my copy.
16360	23840	Breaking new ground and old taboos, Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray tell the story of a society in transformation.
23840	31080	At the top, a cognitive elite is forming in which the past key to the best schools and the best jobs is no longer social background,
31080	33080	but high intelligence.
33080	40520	At the bottom, the common denominator of the underclass is increasingly low intelligence rather than racial or social disadvantage.
40520	45720	The Bell Curve describes the state of scientific knowledge about questions that have been on people's minds for years,
45720	49160	but have been considered too sensitive to talk about openly.
49320	56160	Among them, IQ's relationship to crime, unemployment, welfare, child neglect, poverty, and illegitimacy,
56160	61960	ethnic differences in intelligence, trends in fertility among women with different levels of intelligence,
61960	67160	and what policy can do and cannot do to compensate for differences in intelligence.
67160	75280	Brilliantly argued and meticulously documented, The Bell Curve is the essential first step in coming to grips with the nation's social problems.
75320	80920	Even though it is now 25 years old, The Bell Curve's ideas have had quite the lasting impact.
80920	84440	Richard Herrnstein passed away shortly before The Bell Curve was released,
84440	91040	but the other author, Charles Murray, has in recent years, among other things, been on an episode of Making Sense with Sam Harris.
91040	94080	He's been interviewed on Stefan Molyneux's YouTube channel,
94080	97160	had his ideas discussed on the Joe Rogan podcast,
97160	103040	and regular viewers of my channel will remember The Bell Curve being cited in a recent Steven Crowder video.
103120	110280	At the time of the book's release, the backlash against it in certain sections of the media and scientific community was furious.
110280	114480	Dozens of articles were written by scientists and journalists attacking the book,
114480	120080	studies were conducted to debunk its claims, whole books were written to debunk its claims, actually,
120080	123840	and these criticisms were often phrased very harshly.
123840	127680	Columnist Bob Herbert, writing for the New York Times, described the book as
127680	132880	as a scabrous piece of racial pornography masquerading as serious scholarship.
132880	135920	Mr. Murray can protest all he wants, wrote Herbert.
135920	141200	His book is just a genteel way of calling someone the N-word.
141200	146240	This controversy ignited by The Bell Curve has also had quite the lasting impact.
146240	149840	When Charles Murray is invited to speak at college campuses, for instance,
149840	156000	people turn out in protest, often with angry cries of racist, eugenicist, and so on.
156000	164080	And from the enraged reaction to The Bell Curve, a new reader might expect the book to be blatant and unapologetic racist propaganda.
164080	170800	A neo-Nazi screed arguing for the supremacy of the high IQ white race and such things as that.
170800	175600	However, when we actually sit down and read the book, things aren't quite that simple.
175600	177440	Consider the following quotes.
177440	184880	If tomorrow you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that all the cognitive differences between races were 100% genetic in origin,
184880	187360	nothing of any significance should change.
187360	194720	The knowledge would give you no reason to treat individuals differently than if ethnic differences were 100% environmental.
194720	201040	In any case, you are not going to learn tomorrow that all cognitive differences between races are 100% genetic in origin
201040	207760	because the scientific state of knowledge, unfinished as it is, already gives sample evidence that environment is part of the story.
207760	214480	If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other,
214480	219040	we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other.
219040	224960	It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.
224960	226640	What might the mix be?
226640	229200	We are resolutely agnostic on that issue.
229200	233600	As far as we can determine, the evidence does not justify an estimate.
233600	242080	For virtually all the topics we will be discussing, cognitive ability accounts for only small to middling proportions of the variation among people.
242080	251520	It almost always explains less than 20% of the variance, to use the statistician's term, usually less than 10% and often less than 5%.
251520	257280	What this means in English is that you cannot predict what a given person will do from his IQ score.
257280	258960	So what's going on here?
258960	264240	It seems, from these quotes anyway, that the bell curve is actually a fairly reasonable piece of work.
264240	273120	These are all relatively mild, middle-of-the-road statements here, so this hardly seems like a scabrous piece of racial pornography so far.
273120	280960	Charles Murray has used quotes from the bell curve, such as we have just read, to defend himself and his work against accusations of racism.
280960	290720	Murray and other defenders of the bell curve cast the attacks on the book as resulting from a cowardly reluctance to discuss what they see as difficult scientific truths.
290720	296880	In particular, a reluctance to discuss possible differences in intelligence across designated racial groups.
296880	299040	So this is what we're gonna talk about today.
299040	307120	We're gonna take a look at some of the arguments in the bell curve, discuss some of the most common counterarguments, and see if we can figure out what all the fuss is about.
307120	313680	Did the bell curve deserve its harsh criticism, or is it the case that its critics simply cannot handle the truth?
313680	317920	Before we get to all that, though, as you can see, this video is rather long.
317920	325840	I expect people may have to watch this one in multiple parts, so firstly here, let's just take a second to lay out the format of the video today.
325840	330080	First off, we're gonna briefly talk about intelligence and intelligence testing,
330080	336880	and quickly mention a few concepts that are gonna be important going forward, such as Spearman's G and Factor Analysis.
336880	343600	Then we're gonna introduce the bell curve and summarize the arguments of each of its four main sections as fairly as we can.
343600	350480	After that, we'll move on to counterarguments in sections primarily concerned with the concept of a general intelligence,
350480	356960	the possible problems with IQ testing, the bell curve's calculation of IQ versus environmental factors,
356960	361920	and finally, the political arguments and policy proposals found within the book.
361920	367200	I will include time codes to all of these sections below so you can drop out and come back as needed.
367200	368960	Right then, let's get started.
368960	376080	And if we're going to be reading a book that is about intelligence, we should start off by briefly talking about exactly what that is.
376080	380320	Let's imagine that we want to design an intelligence test from scratch.
380320	383920	And to do this, we first have to answer two difficult questions.
383920	387920	The first is, how exactly do we define intelligence?
387920	391360	And this is a particularly tricky thing to do, as we'll see.
391360	397520	Let's start with the dictionary definition of intelligence, which is as good a place to start as any, I suppose.
397520	400080	And this is from the Oxford English Dictionary.
400080	405120	Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.
405120	409040	Now, our first problem here is that this definition is rather broad.
409040	415440	Think about all the activities and groups of activities that could fall under this definition of intelligence.
415440	420400	Is one's ability to solve complicated mathematical sums governed by intelligence?
420400	423920	How about the ability to solve a difficult chess puzzle?
423920	428000	I'd imagine we'd say those things are associated with intelligence, right?
428000	432960	Well, how about the ability to write a great novel or compose a great piece of music?
432960	437360	Are those things influenced by intelligence, or would we merely call that creativity?
438000	445360	Is knowing whether to pass or shoot in a game of basketball or football influenced by intelligence, or would we merely call that talent?
445360	450000	Or are all of these things some mix of intelligence, talent, and creativity?
450000	454240	We can certainly imagine a novel that is written intelligently, for instance.
454240	462160	Could we say this is some sort of creative intelligence, or are intelligence and creativity strictly two entirely different concepts?
462160	466480	Is there a difference between memorizing and applying a mathematical function, say,
466480	472640	and memorizing and carrying out a piano piece or a dance routine or a set of football plays?
473360	476080	If there is a difference, what is it?
476080	482000	By what metric are we declaring some of those things to be governed by intelligence and others not?
482000	485760	Are there such things as social and emotional intelligence?
485760	490480	What we might call the ability to read a room, to be aware of the emotions of others,
490480	493600	and to react appropriately in interactions with them.
493600	498560	Is intelligence involved there, or should we just call that something like being sociable?
498560	505920	All the various things I just mentioned can be argued to fall under the umbrella of acquiring and applying knowledge and skills, right?
505920	510160	Defining exactly what intelligence is is a very difficult thing to do,
510160	515920	and there is a wide range of opinions among scientists and academics about the best way to go about it.
515920	520480	Following the publication of The Bell Curve and inspired by the harsh criticism it received,
520480	522240	a public statement entitled,
522240	529200	Mainstream Science on Intelligence, was written by Professor Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal.
529200	531200	The statement sets out to outline,
531200	535440	conclusions regarded as mainstream among researchers on intelligence,
535440	542240	in particular on the nature, origins, and practical consequences of individual and group differences in intelligence.
542240	547440	The statement was sent to 131 researchers of whom 52 signed it,
547440	550240	many of whom are themselves cited in The Bell Curve.
550240	556560	Important for us here is that mainstream science on intelligence gives the following definition of intelligence.
556560	564400	Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems,
564400	570720	think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.
570720	575440	It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test taking smarts.
575440	580640	Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings,
580640	585360	catching on, making sense of things, or figuring out what to do.
585360	588720	My favorite part of this definition is, among other things,
588720	592960	because intelligence is apparently all of this and some other stuff too.
592960	596800	My point here is that even among researchers who are cited in The Bell Curve
596800	603360	and would put their name to a defense of its ideas, intelligence is a very broadly defined concept.
603360	606800	And even if we can agree on a definition of intelligence,
606800	609440	the second difficult question we have to answer is this.
610000	612400	How exactly do we measure it?
612400	615920	It's not as simple as testing for some other human abilities.
615920	620240	We can measure how fast someone is by using units of time and distance,
620240	624000	and we can measure how strong someone is by using units of weight.
624000	627840	But what do you use to quantify how smart someone is?
627840	630480	What we need here is an intelligence unit.
630480	634320	We need a way to express someone's intelligence as a number.
634320	639120	Now, most people today will recognize IQ as the most common intelligence unit,
639120	642320	and let's briefly talk a little about how that came to be.
642480	648160	So way back in the old days, if we wanted to determine someone's personality traits and abilities,
648160	652640	we could measure their skull, calculate the volume of their brain,
652640	655120	or simply look at their facial features.
655120	659120	Phrenology, however, has fallen out of favor with scientists of late,
659120	663920	although it should be noted the technology sector is currently in the process of reinventing it.
663920	667840	Now, I won't be going all that deeply into the history of intelligence testing today,
667840	671200	so I'll just start off here by saying that researchers eventually,
671200	674880	for the most part anyway, stopped measuring people's skulls
674880	678400	and started trying to measure what was going on inside them.
678400	685200	The first practical IQ test was invented by French psychologist Alfred Binet in 1905.
685200	688880	This test set out to determine the mental age of school children
688880	691840	and was designed with the purpose of identifying those children
691840	696160	who were underperforming compared to their peers so they could be given extra help.
696800	699040	Such noble beginnings here.
699040	703600	Now, Binet, for his part, stressed that intelligence was affected by environmental factors,
703600	707600	was not expressible as a singular fixed numerical value,
707600	710480	and was not exclusively genetic in origin.
710480	714480	His test was designed to identify those who were struggling in school
714480	718480	and not to rank people into some sort of eugenic hierarchy.
718480	723520	Binet died in 1911 and has since spent the majority of his time spinning in his grave
723520	726160	due to everything else we're going to talk about today.
726160	729280	An American psychologist called Henry H. Goddard
729280	733040	translated Binet's intelligence test into English in 1908
733040	737280	and distributed thousands of copies of the test across the United States.
737280	741680	And in 1916, another American psychologist named Louis Terman,
741680	744800	working for the Stanford Graduate School of Education,
744800	749760	revised the test into what we know today as the Stanford-Binet IQ test.
749760	753440	Both Goddard and Terman also worked together with other psychologists
753440	756880	to create the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests,
756880	762400	which were intelligence tests administered to US military recruits during World War I.
762400	765040	Before we go any further, I'd like to pause for a second
765040	768560	and propose a question about our intelligence tests here.
768560	772480	How do we know that they are actually measuring intelligence?
772480	774800	They're called intelligence tests, sure,
774800	779200	but that doesn't necessarily mean they are actually measuring intelligence, does it?
779200	782800	As we discussed earlier, intelligence is a very broad concept.
782800	786320	How do we know we're not merely measuring a tiny segment of it?
786320	790400	Well, in the early 20th century, English psychologist Charles Spearman
790400	793440	used a statistical technique called factor analysis
793440	796640	to identify what he called the G factor.
796640	800320	Spearman noticed that people's test results across a range of subjects
800320	803680	were positively correlated, and reasoned that this was because
803680	808480	of an underlying general intelligence factor, which he dubbed G.
808480	813120	And this G factor supposedly underlies all mental performance,
813120	815360	so no matter the subject being tested,
815360	819360	they are all influenced by this one general intelligence factor.
819360	823920	And psychometricians claim that IQ tests measure this G factor,
823920	828240	psychometricians being people concerned with psychological measurement there.
828240	832080	Now, G answers both of our difficult questions, if you'd noticed.
832080	836160	Thanks to the G factor, the vast range of potential human intelligence
836160	839040	is no longer a barrier to us testing for it,
839040	842960	because it's supposedly all linked to a single underlying factor
842960	847440	that is able to be measured and expressed as a single numerical value.
847440	851280	It's very handy, isn't it, this general intelligence factor?
851280	853440	Suspiciously handy, one might say,
853440	857760	but we'll talk more about G and Spearman's factor analysis later on.
857760	860400	Now, before we conclude our little history lesson here,
860400	862640	there is something else that must be noted,
862640	866560	and it's that early proponents of IQ testing in America and elsewhere
866560	871360	were not motivated solely by some neutral scientific curiosity.
871360	873040	They were eugenicists.
873040	876000	They wanted to use what they could learn from intelligence testing
876000	879840	as a way to improve the genetic quality of the human population
879840	882480	through what amounts to selective breeding.
882480	885760	Henry Goddard, who translated Binet's intelligence test,
885760	890400	proposed segregating the so-called feeble-minded into colonies
890400	892560	separate from the rest of society.
892560	895520	And Lewis Turman, author of the Stanford-Binet test,
895520	900720	wrote the following in a 1916 work called The Uses of Intelligence Tests.
900720	903840	Thus far, intelligence tests have found their chief application
903840	907600	in the identification and grading of the feeble-minded.
907600	909920	It is safe to predict that in the near future,
909920	914000	intelligence tests will bring tens of thousands of these high-grade defectives
914000	916080	under the surveillance of society.
916080	920560	This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness
920560	923840	and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime,
923840	928160	pauperism, and industrial inefficiency, end quote.
928160	933200	And tens of thousands of Americans were forcibly sterilized during the last century,
933200	938240	and low IQ test results were used to justify many of those sterilizations.
938240	942720	The eugenics movement lost a lot of momentum as a result of the Second World War,
942720	945680	during which eugenics became irrevocably associated
945680	948560	with many of the worst crimes of Nazi Germany.
948560	949840	And in the following decades,
949840	952800	many countries distanced themselves from eugenics policies,
952800	957280	and many scientists became more suspicious of not just eugenics itself,
957280	961760	but also the extent of the worth of intelligence testing as a concept.
961760	963920	Now, not to spoil the end of my video here,
963920	968400	but this is a good chunk of the reason that the reaction to the bell curve was so harsh.
968400	971040	The idea that we can use intelligence test results
971040	975920	in order to inform political policy was only half a lifetime before the book was written,
975920	978160	getting people sent to gas chambers.
978160	982000	So it's not surprising that people would be rather suspicious about it.
982000	985040	Let's just say that anyone attempting to resurrect this idea
985040	988000	needs to be incredibly aware of and respectful of
988000	990720	exactly where what they're proposing can lead.
991280	993840	So people are fleeing eugenics in droves
993840	998640	simply because it was used to justify an indefensible crime against humanity,
998640	1004160	and scientists are increasingly skeptical of the extent of the usefulness of intelligence testing
1004160	1009200	and IQ and efforts to rank people according to biology in general.
1009200	1012080	And all this brings us to the bell curve.
1012080	1014240	The empire strikes back.
1014240	1015120	And in this book,
1015120	1018800	Herrnstein and Murray come to the defense of IQ and say now,
1018800	1020800	everyone calm down.
1020800	1023920	Don't throw the baby out with the bath water here.
1023920	1027920	Intelligence testing and IQ are important and useful concepts,
1027920	1032320	and crucially, what we can learn from IQ testing should inform our politics
1032320	1034880	and be used to change our society.
1035440	1039440	So, you know, eugenics, but nice this time.
1039440	1044240	And since we've now arrived at the bell curve, I think it's time for us to read it.
1044240	1047200	Not all of it, right now, we'd be here all day,
1047200	1049360	but I will briefly summarize it here,
1049360	1052960	for the most part using the introductions that precede each chapter.
1052960	1054320	In the introduction to the book,
1054320	1057600	Herrnstein and Murray begin by talking about intelligence.
1057600	1060240	They offer Spearman's definition of intelligence as
1060240	1063520	a person's capacity for complex mental work,
1063520	1067680	and argue that general intelligence can be measured by IQ tests,
1067680	1068400	saying,
1068400	1070720	Furthermore, the classicists point out,
1070720	1074160	the best standardized tests, such as a modern IQ test,
1074160	1077200	do a reasonably good job of measuring IQ.
1077200	1080320	When properly administered, the tests are not measurably biased
1080320	1083520	against socioeconomic, ethnic, or racial subgroups.
1083520	1087520	They predict a wide variety of socially important outcomes.
1087520	1090000	They also defend the practice of IQ testing
1090000	1092640	from critics within the scientific community,
1092640	1096160	notably evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould,
1096160	1099600	whose 1981 book, The Mismeasure of Man, was,
1099600	1101520	quoting the back of my copy here,
1101520	1103760	immediately hailed as a masterwork,
1103760	1106800	the ringing answer to those who would classify people,
1106800	1110720	rank them according to their supposed genetic gifts and limits.
1110720	1113680	In this book, Gould is highly critical of everything from
1113680	1117200	phrenology and craniometry to modern IQ testing.
1117200	1120880	He argues against the concept of a single general intelligence,
1120880	1124400	and he highlights cases where eugenicists and psychometricians
1124400	1128560	had relied upon bad data and flawed statistical techniques,
1128560	1130800	including the case of Cyril Berth,
1130800	1133200	an early proponent of the use of twin studies
1133200	1135520	for examining the heritability of intelligence,
1135520	1140080	who, after he died, was revealed to have just been making up his research data.
1140640	1142640	That's one way to do it, I suppose.
1142640	1145680	The bell curve was written with the Mismeasure of Man in mind,
1145680	1148720	and is in some ways a response to its claims.
1148720	1151360	A newer edition of the Mismeasure of Man was printed
1151360	1154880	with an extra chapter responding to the claims of the bell curve,
1154880	1157200	and a newer edition of the bell curve was printed
1157200	1161120	with an extra chapter responding in part to Stephen Jay Gould.
1161120	1165040	Gould and Murray probably should have just met up and had a fight at this point.
1165040	1167040	On pages 22 and 23,
1167040	1170800	Hans-Nina Murray summarized their main claims about intelligence,
1170800	1172400	which are the following.
1172400	1175840	One, there is such a thing as a general factor of cognitive ability
1175840	1177760	on which human beings differ.
1177760	1181280	Two, all standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement
1181280	1183680	measure this general factor to some degree,
1183680	1188240	but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.
1188240	1191280	Three, IQ scores match, to a first degree,
1191280	1193680	whatever it is that people mean when they use the word
1193680	1196400	intelligent or smart in ordinary language.
1196960	1198960	Four, IQ scores are stable,
1198960	1202160	although not perfectly so over much of a person's life.
1202160	1205680	Five, properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased
1205680	1208400	against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.
1208400	1211760	And six, cognitive ability is substantially heritable,
1211760	1214800	apparently no less than 40% and no more than 80%.
1215360	1216400	And on that last point,
1216400	1218880	Hans-Nina Murray later writes in a section titled
1218880	1221120	How Much Is IQ a Matter of Genes?
1221120	1223120	For purposes of this discussion,
1223120	1227120	we will adopt a middling estimate of 60% heritability,
1227120	1232960	which by extension means that IQ is about 40% a matter of environment.
1232960	1235680	So, on to part one of the bell curve,
1235680	1238720	which is titled The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite,
1238720	1240880	and introduces Hans-Nina Murray's theory
1240880	1243680	of the cognitive partitioning of society.
1244560	1246240	Since World War II, they argue,
1246240	1250560	colleges in the United States have increasingly admitted people by test score
1250560	1254400	rather than things like social standing or familial connections.
1254400	1257120	Where you could once expect to attend a prestigious college
1257120	1258960	if your father had gone there, for instance,
1258960	1262880	increasingly you now need to have competitive test scores.
1262880	1266480	This has led to high IQ people being found disproportionately
1266480	1270000	in the top institutions and geographically close together.
1270000	1273440	The job market is also increasingly IQ focused,
1273440	1276240	as low IQ jobs are replaced by automation,
1276240	1281360	and the best jobs have apparently become more selective of high IQ candidates.
1281360	1285680	IQ is also apparently a very good predictor of job performance.
1285680	1287120	These high IQ people,
1287120	1291280	economically and geographically segregated from the rest of society,
1291280	1293600	are increasingly partnering with each other,
1293600	1296640	and since we're assuming IQ is largely genetic,
1296640	1299360	are producing high IQ offspring.
1299360	1305120	Society is thus stratifying itself into some sort of intelligence-based caste system.
1305120	1306080	At the end of part one,
1306080	1309040	Hans-Nina Murray summarized their claims by saying,
1309040	1311840	One, the cognitive elite is getting richer in an era
1311840	1314640	when everyone else is having to struggle to stay even.
1314640	1318640	Two, the cognitive elite is increasingly segregated physically from everyone else
1318640	1320720	in both the workplace and the neighborhood.
1320720	1325120	And three, the cognitive elite is increasingly likely to intermarry.
1325120	1326880	Part two of the bell curve is titled
1326880	1329280	Cognitive Classes and Social Behavior,
1329280	1331520	and here, Hans-Nina Murray make the case that
1331520	1336320	intelligence is tied to behavior and predictably determines various things,
1336320	1340160	such as the likelihood of being poor, a criminal, a high school dropout,
1340160	1343360	unemployed, an unwed mother, on welfare, and so on.
1343920	1345200	In order to argue this,
1345200	1348400	Hans-Nina Murray first introduced the source of their data,
1348400	1352400	which is the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, or AFQT.
1353120	1359120	This test was taken as part of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
1359120	1362320	The subjects of this survey were aged 14 to 22,
1362320	1366080	and were administered the Armed Forces Qualifying Test in 1980.
1366560	1369600	Researchers then interviewed the group over the following decade,
1369600	1372320	asking them various questions about themselves.
1372320	1376080	Hans-Nina Murray used the respondents' scores on the AFQT
1376080	1378400	to determine the IQ of each person,
1378400	1381920	and then used their later interview answers to calculate to what degree
1381920	1385600	a high IQ is correlated with positive life outcomes,
1385600	1389680	and to what degree a low IQ is correlated with negative outcomes.
1389680	1392000	Throughout the rest of this section of the bell curve,
1392000	1394640	Hans-Nina Murray go further than simply arguing
1394640	1398640	for the correlation between low IQ and those negative life outcomes.
1398640	1402960	They make the case that one's AFQT score correlates with them more strongly
1402960	1405520	than socioeconomic status does.
1405520	1409120	Hans-Nina Murray compare the AFQT scores of each respondent
1409120	1414240	against their calculation of the socioeconomic status of the respondent's parents.
1414240	1417600	So, as the book Inequality by Design puts it,
1417600	1420480	roughly in the bell curve statistical comparisons,
1420480	1426320	the parent's class represents nurture, and the AFQT score represents nature.
1426320	1428480	Looking at various negative life outcomes,
1428480	1432160	like being in poverty, being in jail, being unemployed, and so on,
1432160	1436880	Hans-Nina Murray repeatedly find that for the young respondents to the survey,
1436880	1442800	AFQT score and by proxy IQ score is a more accurate predictor of life outcomes
1442800	1445440	than a parent's socioeconomic status.
1445440	1448400	Hans-Nina Murray conclude this section by stating that
1448400	1451040	a smarter population is more likely to be
1451040	1455280	and more capable of being made into a civil citizenry.
1455280	1458560	Part three of the bell curve is titled The National Context
1458560	1461520	and is where things start getting especially controversial.
1461520	1464240	This is the section of the book where they discuss differences
1464240	1468000	in cognitive ability across designated racial groups.
1468000	1471520	They review published literature on differences in racial IQ scores
1471520	1474640	and find substantial differences between the various groups.
1474640	1477040	They discuss the ways in which tests can be biased,
1477040	1479440	culturally and otherwise, but ultimately conclude
1479440	1483120	that these group differences cannot be explained away by bias.
1483120	1486080	In chapter 15, Hans-Nina Murray talk about how they think
1486080	1489360	cognitive ability in the West is declining, stating,
1489360	1492560	Throughout the West, modernization has brought falling birth rates.
1492560	1496160	The rates fall faster for educated women than the uneducated.
1496160	1499440	Because education is so closely linked with cognitive ability,
1499440	1502160	this tends to produce a dysgenic effect
1502160	1505120	or a downward shift in the ability distribution.
1505120	1508320	Furthermore, education leads women to have their babies later,
1508320	1512160	which alone also produces additional dysgenic pressure.
1512160	1514640	Have you ever seen the movie Idiocracy?
1514640	1516800	Because this is just that, basically.
1516800	1520240	Lower IQ people have more children than higher IQ people,
1520240	1524160	so therefore average IQ scores are going down.
1524160	1526800	However, Hans-Nina Murray run into a problem here,
1526800	1530560	which is that IQ scores had been going up, not down,
1530560	1533760	in the decades prior to the publication of the bell curve.
1533760	1535760	This is known as the Flynn Effect,
1535760	1539440	named for intelligence researcher James R. Flynn, who documented it,
1539440	1541520	and we will talk more about the bell curve's attempt
1541520	1544000	to account for the Flynn Effect later on.
1544000	1545920	Part four of the bell curve is titled
1545920	1549120	Living Together and is Concerned with Social Policy.
1549120	1552640	This is where Hans-Nina Murray start proposing political solutions
1552640	1556240	to the various problems they outlined in the previous chapters.
1556240	1558960	They discuss, and ultimately brand as ineffective,
1558960	1563040	all contemporary attempts to help disadvantaged children succeed in life.
1563600	1567440	Things like better nutrition, better schooling, a better home environment,
1567440	1572320	all these things can possibly, temporarily make people smarter, to a degree.
1572880	1576320	But in the end, Hans-Nina Murray conclude that they will all eventually
1576320	1579760	run into a genetic limit that cannot be worked around.
1579760	1583760	Far more money is spent in ineffective attempts to help the disadvantaged
1583760	1586720	than is spent on the gifted, Hans-Nina Murray contend,
1586720	1590400	and we should thus directly shift the resources upwards
1590400	1592560	to support our best and brightest.
1592560	1595680	And this quote is from the introduction to Chapter 18.
1595680	1599680	Some federal funds now so exclusively focused on the disadvantaged
1599680	1602640	should be reallocated to programs for the gifted.
1602640	1606880	Affirmative action in schools, as it stands, should be scrapped, of course.
1606880	1612240	Hans-Nina Murray argue for a sort of race-blind, score-based affirmative action.
1612240	1616560	They still support colleges accepting applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds,
1616560	1620400	but only if they have comparable test scores to the other applicants.
1620400	1623360	Affirmative action in the job market should also be scrapped,
1623360	1626640	with Hans-Nina Murray arguing that in pursuit of equality,
1626640	1629200	we have actually already overshot it,
1629200	1633600	and that black people actually attain better quality jobs than white people,
1633600	1636480	once you account for their IQs, of course.
1636480	1639840	Hans-Nina Murray argue for encouraging low IQ parents
1639840	1642560	to have fewer children in a couple of different ways.
1643200	1647360	Firstly, they argue for making marriage a prerequisite for parental rights,
1647360	1650960	and they also support cutting off welfare for low-income mothers,
1650960	1654000	stating that we urge generally that these policies,
1654000	1657520	represented by the extensive network of cash and services
1657520	1661440	for low-income women who have babies, be ended.
1661440	1664960	They also argue more generally in favor of individualism,
1664960	1667200	concluding Chapter 21 by writing,
1667200	1672240	Individualism is not only America's heritage, it must be its future.
1672240	1675520	Hans-Nina Murray conclude this part of the bell curve with the following.
1676160	1679840	Inequality of endowments, including intelligence, is a reality.
1679840	1684160	Trying to pretend that inequality does not really exist has led to disaster.
1684160	1689600	Trying to eradicate inequality with artificially manufactured outcomes has led to disaster.
1689600	1694880	It is time for America to once again try living with inequality as life is lived,
1694880	1699040	understanding that each human being has strengths and weaknesses and so on.
1699040	1702080	This is the end of the main text of the bell curve.
1702080	1705360	Then follows seven appendices explaining various things,
1705360	1709520	about the data and statistical methods used in the book, among other things.
1709520	1713760	Additionally, newer versions of the bell curve contain an afterword written in response
1713760	1718240	to various criticisms directed at the book by various scientists and journalists,
1718240	1721280	and we will be quoting from that at several points later on.
1721840	1724000	So then, that was the bell curve.
1724000	1726640	And before we carry on here, I think it would be worthwhile
1726640	1730160	to attempt to summarize the general argument of the book.
1730160	1733920	So here is my understanding of it in four points.
1733920	1737360	One, general intelligence, or G, exists.
1737360	1740800	General intelligence is to some degree heritable, innate,
1740800	1744560	unable to be significantly changed and unevenly distributed,
1744560	1747120	both within and across population groups.
1748000	1751840	Two, IQ tests measure G fairly and accurately.
1752560	1756480	Three, one's IQ is more important than one's social background
1756480	1758720	in determining one's life outcomes.
1759280	1762560	And four, given what we can learn from these points,
1762560	1765360	we should implement conservative social policies,
1765360	1768800	such as limiting welfare, incentivizing marriage,
1768800	1771360	abandoning affirmative action, and more broadly,
1771360	1775840	we should promote a return to a more individualistic society.
1775840	1779280	Now, I'm sure someone could disagree with the conservative adjective
1779280	1781600	in this last point and argue that Herrnstein and Murray
1781600	1785520	merely promote whatever policies seem to best address the problems they discuss.
1786160	1788960	They propose better access to birth control, for instance,
1788960	1791840	which is not typically a conservative policy.
1791840	1794320	Overall, though, their policy recommendations
1794320	1796960	definitely lean heavily to the right.
1796960	1800400	So it's now time to begin looking at the counter arguments,
1800400	1802880	and we will begin with point one on this list
1802880	1805520	and talk about general intelligence.
1805520	1808160	So if we want to understand general intelligence,
1808160	1810720	we first need to understand the statistical technique
1810720	1814400	by which it is calculated, factor analysis.
1814400	1816720	And if we want to understand factor analysis,
1816720	1820320	we first need to talk about correlation and causation.
1820320	1822400	Starting with correlation, then.
1822400	1826720	Correlation is basically statistical association.
1826720	1829040	Stephen Jay Gould in The Mismeasure of Man
1829040	1830720	describes it in the following way.
1831520	1834160	Correlation assesses the tendency of one measure
1834160	1836400	to vary in concert with another.
1836400	1840560	As a child grows, for example, both its arms and legs get longer.
1840560	1843840	This joint tendency to change in the same direction
1843840	1845680	is called a positive correlation.
1846240	1850880	Not all parts of the body display such positive correlation during growth.
1850880	1854160	Teeth, for example, do not grow after they erupt.
1854160	1857520	The relationship between first incisor length and leg length
1857520	1862000	from, say, age 10 to adulthood would represent zero correlation.
1862000	1865520	Legs would get longer while teeth changed not at all.
1865520	1867680	Other correlations can be negative.
1867680	1870640	One measure increases while the other decreases.
1870640	1873760	We begin to lose neurons at a distressingly early age
1873760	1875360	and they are not replaced.
1875360	1878480	Thus, the relationship between leg length and number of neurons
1878480	1881920	after mid-childhood represents negative correlation.
1881920	1885520	Leg length increases while number of neurons decreases.
1885520	1888240	And Gould also includes this handy illustration
1888240	1890880	of some example correlation graphs here.
1890880	1894800	Now, of course, leg length and arm length are positively correlated
1894800	1897200	because they share an underlying cause,
1897200	1900320	which is simply general biological growth.
1900320	1902240	However, we can think of plenty of things
1902240	1905680	that are positively correlated and do not share a cause.
1905680	1908080	You might be familiar with the following examples
1908080	1911920	from the page Spurious Correlations, which I will link below.
1911920	1915840	Per capita cheese consumption correlates with number of people who died
1915840	1917920	by becoming tangled in their bedsheets.
1918560	1922240	Number of letters in winning word of Scripps National Spelling Bee
1922240	1926960	correlates with number of people killed by venomous spiders, and so on.
1926960	1929600	Obviously, these things have nothing to do with each other.
1930160	1931120	Probably.
1931120	1933520	So some correlations are just chance.
1933520	1936880	It would be an error to assume a shared cause there.
1936880	1940960	Correlation does not imply causation, is the saying.
1940960	1945040	Now, in addition to assuming a shared cause when there is not one,
1945040	1949600	another common mistake here is to ignore a shared cause when there is one.
1949600	1952240	For example, when considering arm and leg length
1952240	1954960	to ignore the underlying biological growth
1954960	1959600	and assume that legs are getting longer because arms are, or vice versa.
1959600	1963600	There are lots of different ways to misrepresent correlations, basically.
1963600	1968800	I agree with Gould when he writes the invalid assumption that correlation implies cause
1968800	1974240	is probably among the two or three most serious and common errors of human reasoning.
1974240	1978800	Anyway, one result of us calculating the correlation between arm and leg lengths
1978800	1981920	is that we have simplified the data somewhat.
1981920	1987520	The strong correlation between the two variables means we can basically express them as one,
1987600	1991520	so long as we don't mind losing a little information along the way.
1991520	1994000	But what if instead of just two variables,
1994000	1999680	we wanted to compare correlations between the size of, say, 50 different body parts?
1999680	2003200	Plotting two measurements in a graph is fairly easy.
2003200	2007680	With the addition of a third measurement, though, things start getting a little trickier.
2007680	2012320	This figure from the Mismeasure of Man, where Gould introduces head measurements into the mix,
2012320	2016320	needs another dimension in order to convey the information.
2016320	2020320	And with more variables added in, the data quickly gets too complex
2020320	2023040	to display with a mere three dimensions.
2023040	2025760	And this brings us to factor analysis.
2025760	2029680	Similar to how we simplified arm and leg length to a single dimension,
2030240	2035440	factor analysis can be used to reduce a complex system of correlated variables
2035440	2038880	to a smaller number of underlying factors.
2038880	2043360	And you might find that just a few underlying factors explain the vast majority of the
2043360	2046480	variations in a larger number of variables.
2046480	2051440	And furthermore, you could identify which factor explained the majority of the variation.
2052080	2055760	I won't be going into the exact specifics of how factor analysis works.
2056480	2061040	I couldn't if I wanted to, to be honest, but this is basically how it is used.
2061040	2062240	To quote Gould again,
2062240	2067680	factor analysis is a mathematical technique for reducing a complex system of correlations
2067680	2069280	into fewer dimensions.
2069840	2074080	So you might be wondering, what does all this have to do with intelligence?
2074080	2080160	Well, factor analysis is how psychologist Charles Spearman came up with the concept of the G factor.
2080720	2085600	Spearman looked at a big mass of data showing that people scores on various intelligence tests
2085600	2089760	were positively correlated, carried out a little factor analysis,
2089760	2093920	and identified the most important underlying statistical factor.
2093920	2097360	He then called this G, or general intelligence.
2097360	2103840	So this G is the underlying general mental ability that we are supposedly measuring with IQ tests.
2103840	2107440	However, there are a few problems with this G factor.
2107440	2110000	One is, as the bell curve itself points out,
2110000	2114800	that it's based on statistical analysis rather than direct observation.
2114800	2120000	We are inferring its existence from the data rather than measuring it directly, basically.
2120000	2123280	It is the result of a particular statistical method.
2124000	2128000	Secondly, simplifying the majority of the data down to a single factor
2128000	2131200	can actually obscure a lot of useful information.
2131200	2135760	What if the data shows that people who do well on tests of numerical ability
2135760	2139280	tend to do well on other tests of numerical ability,
2139280	2142320	and people who do well on tests of their language ability
2142320	2146000	tend to do better on other tests of language ability?
2146000	2151120	We can imagine two people who are determined to be statistically as smart as each other,
2151120	2154880	but who excel in completely different areas, right?
2154880	2157600	And there are several different intelligence theories
2157600	2160720	identifying different clusters of mental abilities.
2160720	2164320	Verbal, logical, spatial, mathematical, whatever else.
2164320	2168000	You can go and read about all of those if you're very bored.
2168000	2172720	But what can we take away from our little chat about correlation and factor analysis here?
2172720	2177680	Well, first of all, factor analysis tells us nothing about causation.
2177680	2179840	It deals with correlations.
2179840	2184240	It can show that there might be common factors underlying different variables,
2184240	2190240	but it does not identify for us why those variables vary.
2190240	2195360	As a comparison here, let's say you take a sample of 10,000 random members of the public
2195360	2199360	and you test their athletic performance at various physical tests.
2199360	2204240	Amount of weight lifted, length jumped, speed at running various distances,
2204240	2206000	sit-ups completed, whatever.
2206640	2211840	And let's say that what you find is that people who perform well on one test relative to the group
2211840	2215360	tend to perform well on the other tests relative to the group
2215360	2217760	and vice versa for those who perform poorly.
2218400	2222560	Now you could, if you so fancied, subject this data to factor analysis.
2222560	2227280	Identify numerically the most important underlying factor and name it F
2227280	2229600	for general fitness or something.
2229600	2234560	And you could probably further assign each person an FQ or fitness quotient.
2234560	2240240	However, what you would not have done is explain why some people are fitter than others.
2240240	2244080	You would have said nothing about the heritability of athletic performance,
2244080	2248480	the degree to which genetics and environment contribute to athletic performance.
2248480	2252320	You'd have said nothing about the causes of the data at all.
2252320	2257520	It would be a leap of logic to assume that each person's FQ is innate and unchangeable.
2257520	2261440	The data you have cannot tell you any such thing by itself.
2261440	2265280	You may also find that your singular numerical fitness quotient
2265280	2267760	obscures a lot of useful information.
2267760	2271520	For instance, you might find people who are better at strength exercises
2271520	2274800	tend to be better at other strength exercises and so on.
2274800	2278320	So the mere existence of a general factor of cognitive ability
2278320	2281600	would not explain why there are differences between people.
2282240	2285280	In fact, the G factor is perfectly consistent
2285280	2290000	with a 100% environmental approach to understanding intelligence.
2290000	2292240	We could play devil's advocate here and say,
2292240	2296480	yes, a general factor of intelligence exists and is important,
2296480	2302320	but the variance in G between people is explained entirely by environmental factors.
2302320	2307360	Childhood nutrition, socioeconomic status, school quality, and so on.
2307360	2310640	Absolutely nothing happens in the factor analysis process
2310640	2316240	to tell us about what the causes are for people having different measurable levels of intelligence.
2316320	2320240	And even if we accept a single general intelligence factor exists,
2320240	2324400	that would not necessarily imply a genetic causation.
2324400	2328960	And speaking of genetics, let's next talk about the word heritability.
2329600	2330960	When the bell curve says,
2330960	2333760	cognitive ability is substantially heritable,
2333760	2336800	apparently no less than 40% and no more than 80%,
2337680	2339360	what does that mean exactly?
2339360	2342320	If we average it for 60%, like they do,
2342320	2345920	are we therefore to assume that each person's individual IQ
2345920	2351200	is 60% determined by heritable genetics and 40% by the environment?
2352000	2353680	Well, no.
2353680	2356960	Heritability is unfortunately one of those awkward words
2356960	2361200	which has a common use understanding and a scientific understanding
2361200	2363840	which differ in a few important ways.
2363840	2366240	The common use understanding is something like
2366240	2370160	the ability of a thing to be passed down genetically, right?
2370160	2373360	You can inherit being tall or having red hair,
2373360	2378240	but you can't inherit a scar or a finger lost in an accident, say.
2378240	2382320	The technical academic meaning of heritability is rather different.
2382320	2385760	Heritability is a numerical concept used to estimate
2385760	2391440	the contribution of genetic variance to overall variance of a trait within a group.
2391440	2394720	So basically, heritability estimates the degree to which
2394720	2399440	the variance of a trait within a group is due to genetics.
2399440	2402160	Height is thus a heritable trait.
2402160	2405680	Taller parents will generally have taller offspring, for example,
2405680	2408560	and this is measurable against a population group.
2409360	2413680	Having two arms, however, is not a heritable trait
2413680	2416720	because almost everyone has two arms.
2416720	2418960	And for people who don't have two arms,
2418960	2422400	that variance is usually environmental in nature.
2422400	2425520	Having two arms is genetically determined,
2425520	2428320	but it is not a heritable trait if you follow
2428320	2431440	because genes account for very little of the variance
2431440	2433360	within the population group.
2433360	2435520	Something that is very highly heritable,
2435520	2438320	we would say has a heritability of one.
2438320	2440320	Something that is not heritable at all,
2440320	2442720	we would say has a heritability of zero.
2443360	2446640	If we say something has a heritability of 0.6,
2446640	2450960	then what we mean there is that 60% of the variance of the trait
2450960	2454720	in a population group will be due to genetic factors.
2455280	2459760	What it does not mean is that 60% of the trait in one individual
2459760	2464000	is due to their genes and 40% due to the environment.
2464000	2467440	Heritability tells us about variance within a group,
2468080	2470480	not the makeup of individuals.
2470480	2472560	It is a population statistic.
2472560	2477040	You cannot meaningfully ask what the heritability of your IQ is.
2477040	2478400	So where am I going with this?
2478400	2481040	Well, there's a couple of points that I'd like to make.
2481040	2484640	The first is that a trait can be determined by your genes
2484640	2488880	and be very lowly heritable, such as the presence of arms,
2488880	2490560	and also the inverse of that.
2490560	2493120	A trait could be very highly heritable
2493120	2496240	and not directly genetically determined.
2496240	2499600	One common example used to illustrate this is earrings.
2500240	2502400	What would we say accounts for the variance
2502400	2505520	in whether people wear earrings within a particular group?
2506080	2508080	Well, depending on the group,
2508080	2511040	most of the variance could be due, in one sense,
2511040	2514160	to a genetic factor, biological sex.
2514640	2517920	Wearing earrings would therefore be a heritable trait,
2517920	2520720	but this does not mean that there is an earring gene
2520720	2523040	that is being passed down generationally.
2523040	2525920	The majority of people wearing earrings being women
2525920	2530160	would be due to environmental factors, fashion and gender roles,
2530160	2532240	which are subject to change over time.
2532800	2534560	In more recent years, for example,
2534560	2537840	men in the West have increasingly been wearing earrings.
2537840	2542480	The heritability of the trait of wearing earrings is thus decreasing,
2542480	2546480	because less of the variance is being accounted for by genetics.
2546480	2547680	But crucially here,
2547680	2552000	nothing is actually happening genetically on the earring front.
2552000	2556720	The change in heritability is down to changing environmental factors.
2556720	2559360	When we say something is due to genetics,
2559360	2562720	we need to be very careful about exactly what we mean.
2562720	2564960	A useful categorization here is
2564960	2568720	direct versus indirect genetic determination.
2568720	2571280	We need to be sure to differentiate between things
2571280	2574160	that are directly genetically determined,
2574160	2578160	as in your genes are directly causing some biochemical process
2578160	2579440	to happen within you,
2579440	2582400	and things that are indirectly genetically determined,
2582400	2586320	as a result of your genes interacting with your environment.
2586320	2588960	Women being more likely to wear earrings, for instance,
2588960	2590640	is a heritable trait,
2590640	2594000	but it is not directly genetically determined.
2594000	2597840	This is relevant to us because IQ could be such a trait,
2597840	2600960	where differences in IQ across designated racial groups
2600960	2604240	are caused not by a direct genetic process,
2604240	2607840	but instead by how our genetically determined characteristics
2607840	2610000	interact with our environment,
2610000	2613520	so as to affect our results on IQ tests.
2613520	2614240	For example,
2614240	2618320	let's imagine your genes cause you to have a particular skin color,
2618320	2620560	and you live in a segregated society
2620560	2623920	in which people with that skin color are discriminated against
2623920	2626560	and do not have equal access to education.
2627120	2629760	Now that group's lower results on IQ tests
2629760	2632960	would be, in one sense, because of their genes.
2632960	2635200	And scientists studying genetics
2635200	2637520	might very well find a strong correlation
2637520	2641520	between particular genes and lowered IQ test results,
2641520	2644800	but if we don't take the environment into account,
2644800	2647440	that by itself can't tell us anything.
2647440	2650720	The point here is that a trait could be very highly heritable
2650720	2653360	and correlated strongly with particular genes
2653360	2657040	and still have zero direct genetic determination.
2657040	2659040	Now the idea that wearing earrings
2659040	2662080	can be more of a heritable trait than having ears
2662080	2665520	is admittedly a bit of a difficult concept to grasp at first sight,
2665520	2667600	and I would understand if it took a little time
2667600	2669920	for someone to wrap their head around all this.
2669920	2672720	Right now, though, what I want you to take away from this section,
2672720	2673600	if nothing else,
2673600	2676400	is the idea that something being heritable
2676400	2681680	does not necessarily mean it is actually being directly caused by genetics.
2681680	2685840	My next point is that heritability estimates the causes of variants
2685840	2686960	within a group.
2687520	2692000	It cannot tell us about reasons for differences across groups.
2692000	2693040	And to illustrate this,
2693040	2697360	we will paraphrase a thought experiment by geneticist Richard Lewontin.
2697360	2699360	Let's say we take a packet of seeds
2699360	2703520	and plant them in fertilized soil in a controlled laboratory environment,
2703520	2706000	and we ensure that the growing plants have sufficient
2706000	2708800	and equal amounts of water and light.
2708800	2710800	And doesn't that sound nice?
2710800	2715040	Now height in plants is a heritable trait, just like in humans,
2715040	2718720	and the plants would thus grow to a range of different heights.
2718720	2722560	Height in this experiment would be very highly heritable,
2722560	2726400	because the fact we're ensuring the plants have an equal environment
2726400	2729200	means that the variance in heights in the group
2729200	2731440	is solely down to genetics.
2731440	2733920	Next, let's say we do that experiment again,
2733920	2736560	only this time we plant the seeds in bad soil
2736560	2741440	and give them less but equal within the group amounts of water and light.
2741440	2745440	The thing to understand here is that height in this second experiment
2745440	2749440	would be exactly as heritable as in the previous experiment.
2750000	2754240	All of the plants from the second group have the same group environment,
2754240	2756960	meaning that, again, the group variance in heights
2756960	2759360	would be solely down to genetics.
2759360	2762480	The poor environment will produce smaller plants,
2762480	2766160	but since they are all subject to that environment equally,
2766160	2768240	heritability remains high.
2768240	2772400	The problems arise when we start trying to compare these two groups.
2772400	2775200	Let's say the second group of plants has an average height
2775200	2778880	that is 15% shorter than the first group, for instance.
2778880	2783200	The heritability of height tells us nothing about why that is.
2783200	2786240	Heritability was the same across both groups.
2786240	2790320	If you're trying to figure out why one group of plants grew larger than the other,
2790320	2794400	saying height is heritable tells us nothing useful.
2794400	2798720	The difference between the groups was entirely down to environmental factors,
2798720	2803040	and heritability, despite being high, played no part.
2803040	2805920	The two points we can take from this thought experiment are,
2805920	2810560	firstly, the heritability of traits does not account for group differences,
2810560	2814160	and secondly, a trait having a high heritability
2814160	2819120	does not mean that trait is immutable or unaffected by the environment.
2819120	2823520	For another example of this, height in humans is a highly heritable trait,
2823520	2827360	but the average human height increased substantially over the last century,
2827360	2829680	and this was due to environmental changes,
2829680	2832160	such as better health care and nutrition.
2832160	2833600	Or for another example,
2833600	2838080	North Koreans are, on average, a few inches shorter than South Koreans,
2838080	2842480	and this is down to the different material conditions in those two countries,
2842480	2846000	not some recent radical divergence in genetics.
2846000	2848960	Height is heritable in both North and South Korea,
2848960	2853280	but it's the environment that is the cause of the variance between the groups.
2853840	2857120	This is something that the bell curve crucially misunderstands
2857120	2861120	when talking about the heritability of intelligence and IQ.
2861120	2862880	On page 109, they say,
2862880	2867200	even a heritability of 0.6 leaves room for considerable change
2867200	2870720	if the changes in environments are commensurably large,
2870720	2873680	the implication here being that higher heritabilities
2873680	2876960	would be less affected by changes in the environment,
2876960	2879200	and this is just not how it works.
2879200	2881440	IQ could be 100% heritable
2881440	2884720	and still massively affected by changes in the group environment.
2884720	2887680	Professor Ned Block from New York University
2887680	2890160	makes several of these points about heritability
2890160	2894320	in an article entitled How Heritability Misleads About Race,
2894320	2895520	and then goes on to say,
2895520	2899120	I hope these points remove the temptation exhibited in the bell curve
2899120	2903840	to think of the heritability of IQ as a constant, like the speed of light.
2903840	2906400	Heritability is a population statistic,
2906400	2908640	just like birth rate or number of TVs,
2908640	2912160	and can be expected to change with changing circumstances.
2912160	2915920	These issues are pathetically misunderstood by Charles Murray.
2915920	2918960	In a CNN interview reported in the New Republic,
2918960	2920000	Murray declared,
2920000	2923600	when I, when we, say 60% heritability,
2923600	2926080	it's not 60% of the variation,
2926080	2930080	it is 60% of the IQ in any given person.
2930080	2932720	Later, he repeated that for the average person,
2932720	2936320	60% of the intelligence comes from heredity,
2936320	2939520	and added that this was true of the human species,
2939520	2943040	missing the point that heritability makes no sense for an individual
2943040	2946480	and that heritability statistics are population relative.
2946480	2949600	So if you don't quite understand all this stuff about heritability,
2949600	2953840	don't feel too bad because Charles Murray doesn't understand it either.
2953840	2956240	Or at least he didn't 25 years ago,
2956240	2958960	he may have done his homework since then, who knows.
2958960	2962320	Looking again at the bell curve's list of claims about intelligence,
2962320	2967760	the only one on here that could be said to be making a point about genetics is number six.
2967760	2971040	Cognitive ability is substantially heritable.
2971040	2972240	However, as we've seen,
2972240	2977360	a trait being heritable does not necessarily mean a direct genetic cause.
2977360	2982400	It does not tell us anything about the heritability of a particular individual's intelligence,
2982400	2986880	and it cannot tell us the reason for differences between groups of people.
2986880	2991200	Those differences between people could be caused by environmental factors,
2991200	2995520	because, twist, environments are heritable too.
2995520	2997680	As the bell curve itself points out,
2997680	3001520	non-genetic characteristics can nonetheless run in families.
3001520	3005440	For practical purposes, environments are heritable too.
3006000	3007680	So to summarize this section,
3007680	3012080	we have considered the method by which a general intelligence factor is determined,
3012080	3014800	and also claims about its heritability.
3014800	3017200	But we can conclude from neither of these things
3017200	3022640	that the variance in intelligence between groups of people has a direct genetic cause.
3022640	3025920	The cause could simply be directly due to the environment,
3025920	3030160	or indirectly by way of how genes are interacting with that environment.
3030720	3032960	So why am I listing off all the ways in which
3032960	3038400	Hanstein and Murray do not prove a genetic cause for cognitive ability, you might ask.
3038400	3041680	Their later comparisons of IQ and environmental factors
3041680	3045040	assume that IQ is largely genetic in origin,
3045040	3048640	so presumably they do prove it at some point, right?
3048640	3051040	Well, to put it bluntly, no.
3051040	3054160	In their section, How Much Is IQ a Matter of Genes?,
3054160	3058720	they estimate the heritability of IQ scores by talking about twin studies.
3059280	3064400	We can use studies of identical twins, non-identical twins, and regular siblings
3064400	3067600	to estimate the extent of genetic effects upon IQ
3067600	3073120	by noting the differences in correlations between their scores on intelligence tests.
3073120	3075520	However, there are a few problems with this.
3075520	3078800	Most importantly for us here being that in attempting to learn about
3078800	3082560	genetic cognitive ability via intelligence test scores,
3082560	3085280	we have to make the assumption that intelligence tests
3085280	3088320	are an accurate measure of cognitive ability.
3088320	3090240	But more on that in a moment.
3090240	3095360	Even if we assume that the tests do give an accurate representation of cognitive ability,
3095360	3100400	attempts to use these correlations to construct a simple genetic model for IQ
3100400	3101920	run into several issues.
3102480	3106560	Firstly, the IQs of identical twins do not perfectly correlate,
3106560	3110400	as we would expect them to, given their nearly identical genetics.
3110400	3113280	The correlation of siblings who were raised apart is weaker
3113280	3116240	than the correlation of siblings who were raised together.
3116240	3120080	And probably most troublesome for a purely genetic model here
3120080	3125280	is that there is also some correlation between parents and adopted children.
3125280	3127360	Their scores correlate to some degree,
3127360	3133120	despite there being no immediate genetic link beyond being the same species, of course.
3133120	3137440	So in our search for exactly how much genetics affects cognitive ability,
3137440	3140960	these observations are only ever going to get us so far.
3140960	3146320	It's very difficult to disentangle the genetic effects from the environmental ones.
3146320	3150080	What we really need here is genetics research to advance to the point
3150080	3153680	where we understand exactly which genes influence intelligence
3153680	3156080	and to which degree they influence intelligence.
3156720	3159920	When the bell curve was published, the evidence was not there.
3159920	3161760	As Herndstein and Murray admit,
3161760	3165360	the state of knowledge does not permit a precise estimate.
3165360	3170240	And in 2019, 25 years later, the evidence is still not there.
3170240	3172960	If anything, with regards to the claims in the bell curve,
3172960	3175760	particularly its claims about racial differences,
3175760	3179040	the genetic story has only gotten more complicated.
3179040	3184240	The reason I say designated racial groups instead of racial groups during this video
3184240	3186000	is because on a genetic level,
3186000	3190560	our skin color folk understanding of racial groups can be unhelpful.
3190560	3192720	There can be greater genetic differences
3192720	3196480	within our socially constructed racial groups than between them.
3196480	3200960	I doubt anyone would be so naive as to expect us to one day identify
3200960	3205440	the singular gene that controls both skin color and intelligence.
3206000	3211200	Someone having dark skin and thus being identified and identifying as black
3211200	3213840	could have a whole range of genetic history.
3213840	3217840	You can't read someone's genes by looking at their skin color.
3217840	3221120	This is important for us because the authors of the bell curve
3221120	3224720	use our socially constructed racial groups in their book.
3224720	3226480	Talking about this, they say,
3226480	3229760	what does it mean to be black in America in racial terms
3229760	3232720	when the word black or African-American can be used
3232720	3236400	for people whose ancestry is more European than African?
3236400	3239680	How are we to classify a person whose parents hail from Panama
3239680	3242480	but whose ancestry is predominantly African?
3242480	3245040	Is he a Latino, a black?
3245600	3248160	The rule we follow here is to classify people
3248160	3251600	according to the way they classify themselves.
3251600	3255200	It would be a leap of logic to assume genetic explanations
3255200	3258640	for characteristics of self-identified groups,
3258640	3262560	given that those groups could have a wide range of genetic makeups.
3262560	3265600	My point with all this is that the bell curve's direct evidence
3265600	3268880	of a genetic basis for IQ is missing.
3268880	3271360	Charles Murray's attitude towards this problem
3271440	3273760	in the years since the publication of the book
3273760	3276160	has been to kick the can down the road,
3276160	3279840	assuming that he and Herrnstein were prematurely right,
3279840	3282880	to borrow a phrase from his afterword to the bell curve,
3282880	3286880	and that the accumulating genetic evidence will prove him right
3286880	3289760	if everyone just waits a little longer.
3289760	3293120	And it remains his tactic more than two decades later.
3293120	3295920	In October of this year, Professor Ewan Birney,
3295920	3299200	the director of the European Bioinformatics Institute,
3299200	3300960	published a blog post titled
3300960	3304240	Race, Genetics and Pseudoscience, an explainer,
3304240	3306000	which discusses, among other things,
3306000	3308480	how our traditional racial categorizations
3308480	3312160	are not reflected in actual patterns of genetic variation,
3312160	3316160	how distinct groups within Africa can be as distinct from each other
3316160	3318080	as they are with non-Africans,
3318080	3322240	how race is not a useful or accurate term for geneticists,
3322240	3325520	and it says that it is often suggested that geneticists
3325520	3328400	who emphasize the biological invalidity of race
3328400	3331200	are under the form of political correctness,
3331200	3333360	forced to suppress their real opinions
3333360	3336560	in order to maintain their positions in the academy.
3336560	3338800	Such accusations are unfounded
3338800	3342560	and betray a lack of understanding of what motivates science.
3342560	3346080	Charles Murray responded to this post on Twitter a few days later,
3346080	3346640	saying,
3346640	3350000	I can't understand why people are so eager to go public
3350000	3353440	with positions for which the weight of the accumulating evidence
3353440	3354800	is so unwelcome
3354800	3358640	and that will be definitively settled within a few years.
3358640	3363680	So it seems the evidence for Murray is still just a few years away.
3363680	3365840	With regards to the bell curve, however,
3365840	3368480	it is possible we are being a little unfair
3368480	3371440	when we criticize it for basing much of its analysis
3371440	3373520	on relatively crude estimations.
3374080	3376800	After all, they do admit the evidence is not there,
3376800	3377520	and they say,
3377520	3381600	if the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation
3381600	3383760	has won out to the exclusion of the other,
3383760	3387600	we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other.
3388240	3391040	We should not criticize scientists for saying,
3391040	3394480	the evidence isn't there yet, but here's a rough guess.
3394480	3397520	Presenting such estimates and attempting to disprove them
3397520	3399840	is a key part of the scientific process.
3400480	3404720	Problems arise when we get to part four of the bell curve, however.
3404720	3406320	While it is fine to say,
3406320	3409520	the evidence isn't there yet, but here's a rough guess,
3409520	3411280	it is not so fine to say,
3411280	3413120	the evidence isn't there yet,
3413120	3414560	here's a rough guess.
3414560	3416320	And based upon this rough guess,
3416320	3419280	you should immediately suspend welfare programs
3419280	3421440	for underprivileged children.
3421440	3423120	But we'll talk more about this later
3423120	3425600	when we discuss the politics of the bell curve.
3425600	3428400	For now, though, let's address the assumption I mentioned earlier
3428400	3430240	when talking about twin studies.
3430240	3431760	We have been in this section
3431760	3435440	assuming that we can measure native intelligence accurately.
3435440	3437920	If we cannot measure native intelligence accurately,
3437920	3441040	then much of what we've talked about thus far is irrelevant.
3441040	3444400	So it's now time to talk about IQ tests.
3444400	3448000	So I summarized the bell curve's claims about IQ tests
3448000	3452160	as IQ tests measure G fairly and accurately.
3452160	3454400	I wrote fairly because of their statement,
3454400	3457680	properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased
3457680	3460720	against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.
3460720	3463520	And I wrote the word accurately because of their statement
3463520	3466880	that all standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement
3466880	3469200	measure this general factor to some degree,
3469200	3472560	but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose
3472560	3474640	measure it most accurately.
3474640	3476480	So firstly here, we're going to discuss
3476480	3479600	a few of the possible problems with IQ tests,
3479600	3481200	starting with the various ways
3481200	3483840	in which they can deliver biased results.
3483840	3487120	Now, direct cultural bias in IQ test items
3487120	3490400	is discussed by Herrnstein and Murray in chapter 13.
3490400	3493920	They use an example of a question that includes the word regata,
3493920	3496160	which is a word that might bias the results
3496160	3499280	towards certain cultural and economic groups.
3499280	3502880	And certain historical so-called intelligence test questions
3502880	3504720	have actually been much worse than this.
3505280	3509040	Some of them amounted to nothing more than general knowledge questions.
3509040	3511600	The army alpha test used in World War I
3511600	3513440	asked army recruits to identify
3513440	3516320	what particular celebrities were famous for,
3516320	3519440	in which cities certain cars were manufactured,
3519440	3522320	and the products produced by certain brands.
3522320	3525120	Questions like these obviously have very little to do
3525120	3527280	with any native intellectual ability,
3527280	3528800	they're just testing whether or not
3528800	3531760	you happen to already know the answer.
3531760	3534160	There's no opportunity to work it out,
3534160	3537600	so any psychometricians constructing intelligence tests
3537600	3538880	certainly need to be careful
3538880	3542400	to not include biased test items like these ones.
3542400	3545360	Tests can also be biased for instruction.
3545360	3547440	And what do we mean by instruction here?
3547440	3549680	Well, simply whether or not you've been taught
3549680	3550800	the meaning of a word
3550800	3553520	or the best method for solving a maths problem
3553520	3555200	is going to matter a lot on a test
3555200	3557680	that requires you to draw upon your mathematical
3557680	3559200	and language abilities.
3559200	3560480	As an example here,
3560480	3562400	I'm gonna assume that we all agree
3562400	3565120	it would be unfair to expect a random teenager
3565120	3567840	to, by themselves, during a test,
3567840	3569760	invent trigonometry.
3569760	3571920	If you include trigonometry questions
3571920	3573520	on your intelligence test,
3573520	3574880	what you'll be testing for there
3574880	3577760	will not solely be the intelligence of the respondent,
3577760	3579680	but also whether or not they've been taught
3579680	3581280	trigonometry before,
3581280	3583200	how recently they were taught it,
3583280	3585360	and how well they were taught it.
3585360	3586880	This is relevant for us here
3586880	3589200	because the Armed Forces Qualifying Test,
3589200	3592240	which is the primary source of intelligence test data
3592240	3593280	in the bell curve,
3593280	3595040	had as one of its four sections
3595040	3597440	a mathematics test which included questions
3597440	3601120	examining knowledge of classroom trigonometry and algebra.
3601120	3604000	This is more of a test of scholastic aptitude
3604000	3605520	than native intelligence,
3605520	3607280	and is also testing by proxy
3607280	3610080	the quality of the teaching at the different schools
3610080	3612240	that the AFQT respondents went to.
3612800	3614480	We can't assume that to be equal
3614480	3616960	across thousands of different people, can we?
3616960	3619440	This is one of a few problems with the AFQT
3619440	3620720	that has roots in the fact
3620720	3623280	that it was not designed as an IQ test,
3623280	3625120	but more on that in a second.
3625120	3628640	Another way that IQ tests can be biased is for speed.
3628640	3630720	Think of the definitions of intelligence
3630720	3631840	we've seen so far.
3631840	3635120	A capacity for complex mental work,
3635120	3637440	catching on, making sense of things,
3637440	3639440	and figuring out what to do.
3639440	3641680	And simply because of the way IQ tests
3641680	3642480	are administered,
3642480	3643920	we have to add the words
3643920	3646800	within the time constraints of an academic test
3646800	3648320	to all of those things.
3648320	3650160	IQ tests are by their nature
3650160	3652480	biased towards how fast you can think
3652480	3654560	and away from other important qualities
3654560	3657280	which contribute to overall cognitive ability
3657280	3660720	such as stamina, determination, and discipline.
3660720	3661760	Similar to that point,
3661760	3663920	IQ tests have a more general bias
3663920	3667280	towards familiarity with an academic environment.
3667280	3669440	People unfamiliar with taking tests
3669440	3670720	are going to fare worse
3670720	3672560	than people who are very used to it
3672560	3675600	simply due to being in an unfamiliar environment.
3675600	3677760	Things like anxiety and stress
3677760	3679040	come into play here.
3679040	3681120	Those can affect intelligence test results
3681120	3682800	despite having nothing directly
3682800	3684960	to do with intelligence themselves.
3684960	3686000	Herrnstein and Murray
3686000	3688480	are particularly aware of that last point,
3688480	3689760	and we need to briefly discuss
3689760	3691280	the Flynn effect here.
3691280	3693360	So when IQ tests are constructed,
3693360	3696560	they're standardized using a sample of test takers.
3696560	3698000	Now what that means in practice
3698000	3700080	is the testers will test some people,
3700080	3701760	work out the average score,
3701760	3704560	and set that to correspond to 100.
3704560	3708800	This is why we recognize an IQ of 100 as the average.
3708800	3711040	When those IQ tests are later revised
3711040	3713360	or when new IQ tests are designed,
3713360	3715840	they're also standardized on new groups of people
3715840	3718640	and their average is set again to 100.
3719200	3720720	However, researchers noticed
3720720	3722160	that when newer test subjects
3722160	3724400	take the older versions of a test,
3724400	3727520	their IQ scores are on average higher.
3727520	3730640	So IQ scores have gone up over time, basically,
3730640	3734160	meaning if you believe that IQ tests measure intelligence,
3734160	3737440	then people must be getting more intelligent, right?
3737440	3739440	This is troublesome for Herrnstein and Murray
3739440	3741120	because they argue the opposite,
3741120	3743840	that cognitive ability is deteriorating.
3743840	3745360	And this brings us back to our point
3745360	3748160	about bias towards an academic environment.
3748160	3749520	Addressing the Flynn effect,
3749520	3751680	Herrnstein and Murray write the following.
3751680	3753520	There is a further question to answer.
3753520	3755360	Does a 15-point IQ difference
3755360	3757440	between grandparents and their grandchildren
3757440	3760320	mean that the grandchildren are 15 points smarter?
3760320	3763200	Some experts do not believe that the rise is holy,
3763200	3766240	perhaps not even partly a rise in intelligence,
3766240	3767840	but in the narrower skills
3767840	3771040	involved in intelligence test-taking per se.
3771040	3772240	So this, if it were true,
3772240	3775520	would mean that people are actually getting less intelligent,
3775520	3776960	but at the same time,
3776960	3780240	they are getting better at taking IQ tests.
3780240	3783520	Now, you might say, isn't that a huge contradiction?
3783520	3785920	Aren't they basically admitting that IQ tests
3785920	3789200	measure something other than inborn intelligence?
3789200	3792000	After all, if IQ tests supposedly measure
3792000	3794400	native cognitive ability accurately,
3794400	3796160	how could scores be going up
3796160	3798800	while cognitive ability is going down?
3798800	3800960	However, to be fair to Herrnstein and Murray,
3800960	3802800	it would be hasty to dismiss
3802800	3805440	their dysgenics hypothesis outright.
3805440	3807520	There is another possibility here,
3807520	3811040	and it's that people are getting genetically less intelligent,
3811040	3813920	but the environmental factors affecting intelligence
3813920	3816320	have undergone such large changes
3816320	3818800	that their positive effects upon IQ
3818800	3820160	are more than accounting
3820160	3822720	for the downward genetic ability shift.
3822720	3826000	So roughly, we would have lost a genetic IQ point
3826000	3827280	thanks to dysgenics,
3827280	3830880	but gained two back thanks to a better environment.
3830880	3833120	So what evidence does the bell curve produce
3833120	3835040	in support of this downward trend
3835040	3837200	in genetic cognitive ability?
3837200	3839600	Well, unfortunately for Herrnstein and Murray,
3839600	3841040	their main source of data,
3841040	3843680	the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,
3843680	3845120	is not much use here.
3845760	3848800	Ideally, what we want to do is give IQ tests
3848800	3852000	to the children of women who took part in the AFQT,
3852000	3854880	so we could directly compare child to parent
3854880	3857600	and see if any downwards shift was happening.
3857600	3859280	However, this would be a mistake,
3859280	3860720	as since our data is coming
3860720	3864000	from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,
3864000	3866800	the respondents are, appropriately, young.
3867360	3869440	People who wait longer to have children
3869440	3872160	are typically wealthier and better educated,
3872160	3875280	and thus tend to have children with higher IQs.
3875280	3878560	Limiting ourselves to looking at only young mothers
3878560	3882880	will skew the apparent IQ of the next generation downwards,
3882880	3885040	so it would be an inaccurate thing to do.
3885600	3887440	Herrnstein and Murray are, thankfully,
3887440	3888960	well aware of this problem.
3889840	3892880	Not that it stops them from trying, however.
3892880	3895440	Herrnstein and Murray's dysgenics hypothesis
3895520	3899040	is discussed in Intelligence, Genes, and Success,
3899040	3901520	Scientists Respond to the Bell Curve,
3901520	3905600	a 1997 book which responds to many of the points
3905600	3907040	made in the Bell Curve.
3907040	3908960	The authors of that book, for their part,
3908960	3911120	find no direct empirical evidence,
3911120	3913680	either for or against a dysgenic effect
3913680	3915760	acting upon cognitive ability,
3915760	3918320	stating that, insofar as we are aware,
3918320	3921920	there is nothing but anecdotal evidence for dysgenics.
3921920	3923920	Anyway, let's get back on track.
3923920	3927280	Now, to illustrate another way IQ tests can be biased,
3927280	3929360	I think it would be a good exercise for us all
3929360	3933600	to briefly take a very simple one-question test together.
3933600	3936240	So get your pencil and paper ready, folks.
3936240	3936880	Here it is.
3938000	3939200	Easy, right?
3939200	3942320	An incredibly simple number sequence question there,
3942320	3945440	the sort you'd expect nearly anyone to be able to work out.
3946000	3949040	It's also a fair and unbiased question, of course.
3949040	3951920	I mean, everyone was given the exact same question
3951920	3954960	and the exact same amount of time to answer it, right?
3954960	3958080	What could be more fair and unbiased than that?
3958080	3960320	Now, of course, this question is not fair.
3960320	3963760	It is biased in favor of Japanese people.
3963760	3965920	And anime fans, I guess.
3965920	3968000	The point here is that this question would,
3968000	3970400	in any language, be biased against people
3970400	3972640	who don't speak that language.
3972640	3974960	A question in English is biased against people
3974960	3977120	who don't speak English, isn't it?
3977120	3978400	Now you might protest.
3978400	3980480	This seems like a very obvious point.
3980480	3984240	I mean, surely nobody is gonna give an IQ test in English
3984240	3986880	to a group of people who are not fluent in English
3986880	3990000	and then try to pass off those results as legitimate, right?
3990640	3992880	Well, stay tuned, folks.
3992880	3995840	One point not given due consideration by the bell curve
3995840	3998000	during their discussion of testing bias
3998000	4001120	is that even a completely unbiased test,
4001120	4003760	were it possible to construct such a thing,
4003760	4006080	would still deliver biased results
4006080	4008960	if it were being carried out in a biased system.
4009680	4013040	When Herrnstein and Murray say properly administered IQ tests
4013040	4014880	are not demonstrably biased,
4014880	4017360	they seemingly mean that the tests themselves
4017360	4019920	do not contain words like regatta,
4019920	4023600	not that the tests necessarily deliver fair results.
4023600	4027440	So that is another potential problem with IQ tests to watch out for.
4027440	4031600	Even if we eliminate as much cultural bias as possible from the test,
4031600	4033920	we could still, thanks to the wider environment
4033920	4037840	the tests are taking place in, be receiving biased results.
4037840	4040400	For instance, if you carried out an IQ test
4040400	4043920	in a racially segregated white supremacist state,
4043920	4047440	that environment is obviously gonna affect the average IQ scores
4047440	4049920	of different designated racial groups.
4049920	4051120	Now you might protest.
4051120	4053680	This also seems like a very obvious point.
4053680	4056720	I mean, surely nobody's gonna carry out an IQ test
4056720	4059680	in a racially segregated white supremacist state
4059680	4062720	and then try to pass off those results as legitimate, right?
4063600	4065840	Again, stay tuned, folks.
4065840	4068720	Now keeping in mind all the various possible problems
4068720	4070880	with IQ testing that we've just discussed,
4070880	4073120	let's take a look at a few of the IQ tests
4073120	4077600	that Herrnstein and Murray cite as evidence for claims in the bell curve.
4077600	4080800	Surely they will be properly administered, right?
4080800	4082960	After all, Herrnstein and Murray themselves
4082960	4085840	discuss many of the same issues that we just have.
4085840	4088160	It would follow that given their familiarity
4088160	4089520	with these potential problems,
4089520	4092320	they would of course endeavor to avoid them.
4092320	4094560	So let's see how they do on that front.
4095120	4098160	We'll take a look at a particular section of the bell curve now,
4098160	4099360	see what the claims are,
4099360	4102960	and then have a bit of a dig into the sources backing up those claims.
4102960	4104640	And this is from a section titled
4104640	4110000	How do African Americans compare with blacks in Africa on cognitive tests?
4110000	4111120	And I quote,
4111120	4115520	This question often arises in the context of black-white comparisons in America,
4115520	4118160	the thought being that the African black population
4118160	4120720	has not been subjected to the historical legacy
4120720	4123360	of American black slavery and discrimination
4123360	4125760	and might therefore have higher scores.
4125760	4128480	Richard Lynn was able to assemble 11 studies
4128480	4131040	in his 1991 review of the literature.
4131040	4135200	He estimated the median black African IQ to be 75,
4135200	4140800	approximately 1.7 standard deviations below the US overall population average,
4140800	4144880	about 10 points lower than the current figure for American blacks.
4144880	4147440	In summary, African blacks are, on average,
4147440	4151280	substantially below African Americans in intelligence test scores.
4151840	4154720	Psychometrically, there is little reason to think that these results
4154720	4157040	mean anything different about cognitive functioning
4157040	4159520	than they mean in non-African populations.
4159520	4162240	For our purposes, the main point is that the hypothesis
4162240	4166160	about the special circumstances of American blacks depressing their test scores
4166160	4169120	is not substantiated by the African data.
4169120	4171120	So this is Herrnstein and Murray's answer
4171120	4175680	to those who point to the legacy of slavery and discrimination in the United States
4175680	4178480	as an explanation for the differences in IQ scores
4178480	4180720	between its black and white populations.
4180720	4182880	They point to black people in Africa and say,
4182880	4185680	hey, well, they also got lower scores.
4185680	4190720	Black African people haven't been subject to discrimination in America after all,
4190720	4194400	so doesn't this prove that discrimination in America
4194400	4196480	can't be depressing black IQ scores?
4197040	4198800	Well, not really.
4198800	4201760	Herrnstein and Murray's decision to limit their concern here
4201760	4206160	to American black slavery and discrimination is a huge oversight
4206160	4210080	because there could also be discrimination in whichever parts of Africa
4210080	4212160	they are talking about, if you follow.
4212160	4216880	That could be, in a similar way, depressing the scores there, too.
4216880	4219920	If that were the case, attempting to use the African data
4219920	4222640	as some sort of control test for the American data
4222640	4225200	would be fairly ridiculous, to say the least.
4225200	4229760	America does not have a monopoly on discrimination and depression, does it?
4229760	4234080	And so we need to ask, which parts of Africa are they talking about?
4234080	4238000	They say that Richard Lin was able to assemble 11 studies
4238000	4240800	in his 1991 review of the literature.
4240800	4243200	Now, Herrnstein and Murray claiming the acknowledgments
4243200	4245600	at the start of the bell curve to have benefited
4245600	4248400	especially from the advice of this Richard Lin,
4248400	4252720	who they elsewhere call a leading scholar of racial and ethnic differences,
4252720	4255920	and they cite his work several times throughout the book.
4255920	4260480	So let's take a look at Richard Lin's 1991 review of the literature,
4260480	4264800	entitled, Race Differences in Intelligence, A Global Perspective,
4264800	4267680	which was published in Mankind Quarterly,
4267680	4269920	and remember the name of that journal, folks,
4269920	4272400	as we'll be talking more about that later on.
4272400	4274640	So the first thing we'll notice about this review
4274640	4277360	is that it unfortunately designates people as either
4277360	4280640	caucasoids, mongoloids, or negroids,
4280640	4283600	including, quote, hybrids of those groups,
4283600	4287680	for instance, caucasoid, negroid, hybrids, and so on.
4287680	4291120	I can only apologize for having to read out this rubbish.
4291120	4294080	So let's look at the 11 studies included in this review
4294080	4297360	and see which areas of Africa we are concerned with.
4297360	4301200	Well, there's one from what was then known as the Belgian Congo,
4301200	4304480	one from Ghana, two from Nigeria, one from Uganda,
4304480	4308400	one from Zambia, and five from South Africa.
4308400	4310320	And there is rather a lot to comment on here,
4310320	4313200	but how about we start with sample sizes?
4313200	4316480	Some of them are rather small, you may have noticed.
4316480	4321440	87 people for Nigeria, 50 people for Uganda, and so on.
4321440	4325040	By far the most represented area here is South Africa.
4325040	4327360	The number of people tested in South Africa
4327360	4331280	was more than double the number of all the other subjects combined.
4331280	4333280	And what's the significance of this?
4333280	4336320	Well, this review was published in 1991.
4336320	4340080	South African apartheid ended in 1994.
4340080	4342800	Now, I don't want to get too deep into this right now,
4342800	4344240	but for those who don't know,
4344240	4347360	apartheid was an explicitly white supremacist system
4347360	4349680	of enforced racial segregation.
4349680	4352960	Non-white South Africans were openly discriminated against,
4352960	4355840	forced from their homes, forbidden to live in certain areas
4355840	4358800	and hold certain jobs, and most importantly for us here,
4358800	4361040	had to attend segregated schools,
4361040	4363920	which were massively underfunded compared to the schools
4363920	4366160	that the white South Africans went to,
4366160	4370000	many being without electricity or even running water.
4370000	4373440	And just so we know the sort of education system we're dealing with here,
4373440	4376480	I'll quickly quote some relevant passages from South Africa,
4376480	4379440	a country study from the Library of Congress.
4379440	4382400	The Bantu Education Act of 1953
4382400	4385120	widened the gaps in educational opportunities
4385120	4386800	for different racial groups.
4386800	4389280	Two of the architects of Bantu education,
4389280	4392960	Dr. W.M. Iselin and Dr. Hendrik F. Ferwerd,
4392960	4395920	had studied in Germany and adopted many elements
4395920	4399200	of National Socialist, Nazi, philosophy.
4399760	4402320	The concept of racial purity in particular
4402320	4406560	provided a rationalization for keeping black education inferior.
4406560	4409120	Ferwerd, then Minister of Native Affairs,
4409200	4411760	said that black Africans should be educated
4411760	4414160	for their opportunities in life
4414160	4415760	and that there was no place for them
4415760	4418720	above the level of certain forms of labor.
4418720	4420960	The Bantu Education Act helped pave the way
4420960	4423920	for labor strife in the 1980s and 1990s
4423920	4427120	by institutionalizing a plan to restrict black workers
4427120	4430400	to low-paid jobs through deliberately inferior education.
4431200	4433600	During the 1960s and 1970s,
4433600	4435360	per capita spending on white pupils
4435360	4438240	was about ten times greater than educational spending
4438240	4439440	on black pupils.
4439440	4442560	By the early 1990s, the gap had been reduced by half,
4442560	4444960	but in general, standards for teacher qualifications
4444960	4446400	and facilities in black schools
4446400	4449520	continued to be inferior to those in white schools.
4449520	4452880	The discrepancies in education among racial groups were glaring.
4452880	4455120	Teacher-pupil ratios in primary schools
4455120	4457360	averaged 1 to 18 in white schools,
4457360	4459280	1 to 24 in Asian schools,
4459280	4461280	1 to 27 in colored schools,
4461280	4463440	and 1 to 39 in black schools.
4464080	4467200	Moreover, whereas 96% of all teachers in white schools
4467200	4468480	had teaching certificates,
4468480	4472160	only 15% of teachers in black schools were certified.
4472160	4474240	Secondary school pass rates for black pupils
4474240	4477040	in the nationwide standardized high school graduation exams
4477040	4479440	were less than one-half the pass rate for whites.
4480080	4481360	You get the point, I think.
4481920	4484160	So what Hernstein and Murray have done here
4484160	4487520	in attempting to prove that a history of racial discrimination
4487520	4490880	in America is not depressing black IQ scores
4490880	4493520	is point to a study citing similar scores
4493520	4496400	in a system of open racial discrimination.
4496400	4499200	This is utterly ridiculous, obviously.
4499200	4501760	Anyway, we're now gonna take a look at some of these studies
4501760	4503440	compiled by Richard Lin,
4503440	4506800	and we'll start with this one, Woburn 1969,
4506800	4511680	which apparently reported an IQ score of 86 from Nigeria.
4511680	4514080	And here it is, the meaning and stability
4514080	4517120	of Raven's matrices test among Africans,
4517120	4518960	and let's read a little of that.
4518960	4522080	This paper aims to clarify our understanding of factors
4522080	4524640	affecting African scores on ability tests,
4524640	4526800	Raven's matrices in particular.
4526800	4528720	Though the main burden is theoretical,
4528720	4531280	some fresh data from Nigeria will be shown.
4531280	4534320	During 1965, a testing program was carried out
4534320	4536320	among factory workers in Nigeria.
4536320	4539360	The results from 86 men will be reported here.
4539360	4541760	They were tested individually in English or Pidgin
4541760	4544880	by the author with the aid of a trained Nigerian assistant.
4544880	4548080	Among the test battery were Raven's progressive matrices
4548080	4550560	and an adapted embedded figures test,
4550560	4552960	which with an index of educational attainment
4552960	4554560	are explained by Woburn.
4554560	4556000	Six months after the tests,
4556000	4558160	each man was given the matrices again.
4558160	4559760	There was no intervening coaching,
4559760	4562400	and the test was given as though it was to be a new experience
4562400	4564000	with full instructions repeated
4564000	4567920	and evidently equally necessary in most cases as previously.
4567920	4570160	Men were not overtly asked to pit their presence
4570160	4571840	against their previous efforts.
4571840	4574080	Results were presented in table one.
4574080	4577280	The relation between retested matrices and EFT
4577280	4578560	is significantly greater
4578560	4581760	than between the initial matrices testing and EFT,
4581760	4583600	even though in the former comparisons,
4583600	4586000	the tests were done six months apart.
4586000	4588800	Table one shows that the overall differences in retesting
4588800	4591280	were significant and suggests that improvements
4591280	4594800	were found particularly among the lower initial scorers.
4594800	4598000	Taken with the improved EFT correlation in table two,
4598000	4600560	a strong case can be made that the second testing
4600560	4602480	gave a distinctly more valid measure
4602480	4606160	of whatever abilities the matrices and EFT involve.
4606160	4608960	So to quickly summarize, in 1965,
4608960	4612000	researchers gave 86 Nigerian factory workers
4612000	4613840	the Raven's Progressive Matrices Test
4613840	4616160	and then gave it to them again six months later.
4616160	4617600	The second time they took the test,
4617600	4619040	they performed better overall,
4619040	4620640	and the results better correlated
4620640	4623200	with another test they took called the EFT.
4623200	4625680	And table one here shows both mean results,
4625680	4630400	15.9 the first time, increasing to 18.73 the second time.
4630400	4634240	What is missing here, you may have noticed, is an IQ score.
4634240	4636640	This study does not report an IQ score
4636640	4638400	for anyone involved in the test.
4638400	4640960	It reports their scores on the matrices test.
4641520	4645040	So why then does Lin's review cite Wober 1969
4645040	4648080	as having reported an IQ score of 86?
4648080	4652400	Well, looking at table one, 86 men took the test.
4653120	4653680	Do you see?
4654480	4658160	Now, most likely here, this is a simple typographical error,
4658160	4660720	and Lin, or whoever typed up his data,
4660720	4662880	accidentally wrote the number of test subjects
4662880	4664480	in the IQ field.
4664480	4667360	Regardless, though, Lin's review is not accurately
4667360	4670560	reporting the IQ score from Wober 1969
4670560	4672160	because there wasn't one.
4672160	4675680	Lin cites Wober 1969 again in his later book,
4675680	4678080	IQ and the Wealth of Nations,
4678080	4681600	where he says in 1965, norms for the standard
4681600	4684960	progressive matrices were collected by Wober 1969
4684960	4687280	for a sample of 86 adult men.
4687280	4689760	Their mean score was 15.9.
4689760	4691600	And then he later claims that this equates
4691600	4693680	to an IQ of 64.
4693680	4696240	Now, there are several lies by omission here.
4696240	4701120	Firstly, Wober 1969 did not report a mean score of 15.9.
4701120	4703680	It reported a mean score of 15.9
4703680	4707120	and a mean score of 18.73.
4707120	4709920	It showed how scores go up with retesting.
4709920	4712080	And additionally, it claims that a strong case
4712080	4714000	can be made that the second testing
4714000	4715840	gave a distinctly more valid measure
4715840	4719040	of whatever abilities the matrices and EFT involve.
4719040	4721680	Lin intentionally chooses to only report
4721680	4723200	the lower score here.
4723200	4725840	Another lie by omission here is that Lin declines
4725840	4728720	to mention that the sample of 86 adult men
4728720	4732400	were not randomly drawn from the general Nigerian population.
4732400	4734720	They were not an accurate representation
4734720	4736240	of the society where they lived,
4736240	4738320	and nor were they intended to be.
4738320	4740560	They were all factory workers.
4740560	4743760	Reporting the test results of only 86 men
4743760	4746080	who are all employed in the same job
4746080	4747840	as representative of a country,
4747840	4751280	which at the time had a population of 50 million people,
4751280	4752880	is... rubbish.
4754160	4755040	Just rubbish.
4755680	4757680	Next up, let's talk about this result,
4757680	4761440	an IQ of 75 for people in Zambia,
4761440	4767360	cited from Pons 1974 and Crawford Nutt 1976.
4767360	4771280	So the 1976 paper from Crawford Nutt is titled
4771280	4774480	Are Black Scores on Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices
4774480	4776960	an Artifact of Test Presentation?
4776960	4780080	And opens by saying that previous research has shown that
4780080	4782400	when the method of test presentation ensures
4782400	4785200	that testees understand adequately the requirements
4785200	4786880	of the test situation,
4786880	4789520	when the method also makes certain that the testees know
4789520	4792640	how items of the test are to be responded to,
4792640	4795600	and when the method reduces the anxiety of the subjects
4795600	4797120	about being tested,
4797120	4800160	then the results obtained from the administration of the test
4800160	4802560	are remarkably different from those that result
4802560	4805280	from administration in which the same test is presented
4805280	4807200	in the same way to all testees,
4807200	4809440	regardless of their cultural origin.
4809440	4812480	It goes on to detail how a researcher named Pons
4812480	4815200	gave the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test
4815200	4818800	to a group of Zambian copper miners in 1962,
4818800	4821040	using the standard method of delivery.
4821600	4825040	Then later, Pons administered the test again to another group,
4825040	4828800	only this time using a different method of test presentation.
4828800	4830240	As table one shows,
4830240	4834000	the second group showed a rather dramatic difference in score.
4834000	4836080	Now, the thinking behind all this might be
4836080	4838400	that a group of Zambian copper miners
4838400	4840800	aren't necessarily going to be all that familiar
4840800	4843680	with taking academic tests, not to generalize,
4843680	4845600	and if you want more accurate results,
4845600	4848880	it might be worth taking the time to actually explain to them
4848880	4851120	what it is that they're being expected to do.
4851680	4852960	Now, Crawford Knott claims
4852960	4854720	that the different method of presentation
4854720	4857040	did not alter anything about the test itself
4857040	4860240	and is based upon suggestions found in the 1960 guide
4860240	4864160	to the standard progressive matrices written by John C. Raven,
4864160	4868640	AKA the guy what invented the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.
4868640	4870880	After reporting the findings of Pons,
4870880	4873360	Crawford Knott takes things one step further
4873360	4877200	and tests a selection of pupils from a long-established high school
4877200	4882080	situated in the black residential area of Soweto near Johannesburg,
4882080	4884720	a school that is described as having high standards
4884720	4887680	and whose students would be used to being tested.
4887680	4890640	Crawford Knott tested two samples of these schoolchildren
4890640	4893680	using the same presentation method as described by Pons,
4893680	4896400	and the results received were actually slightly higher
4896400	4899280	than the equivalent age range of the white group
4899280	4901600	on whom the test was normalized.
4901600	4905680	Now, you might say, what has Crawford Knott actually proved there?
4905680	4910320	Test results go up the closer you get to a good school, I suppose.
4910320	4912640	This shouldn't be surprising anyone.
4912640	4916080	If you test a relatively uneducated group of copper miners,
4916080	4917440	you get one result.
4917440	4920800	Do that same test in a competitive academic institution
4920800	4922720	and you will get a higher result.
4922720	4924960	By changing the method of test presentation
4924960	4927520	and changing the group which you are testing,
4927520	4929600	you can get a whole range of results.
4929600	4932320	This is why researchers don't usually test people
4932320	4935600	in just one area, one workplace, or one school
4935600	4938080	and then try to pass off that singular result
4938080	4941600	as representative of the entire country that they live in.
4941600	4944560	That would be a remarkably ignorant thing to do.
4945280	4950240	Speaking of, back to Richard Lin and his claimed IQ of 75 for Zambia,
4950240	4952800	which cites both Pons and Crawford Knott
4952800	4954480	as the source of the data there.
4954480	4956240	So how did that happen?
4956240	4959760	Well, what Lin does is, he cites the much lower results
4959760	4961760	from the research carried out by Pons,
4961760	4964720	which are presented in Crawford Knott's paper,
4964720	4968240	and then completely ignores Crawford Knott's experiment in the school,
4968240	4970960	which reported results above the white norm.
4971600	4975840	The entire point of Crawford Knott's paper goes totally unmentioned by Lin,
4975840	4980240	who simply extracts the data that he wants and discards the rest.
4980240	4983360	He had data showing a black African test score
4983360	4985120	that was above the white norm,
4985120	4988000	and he simply decided to ignore it.
4988000	4990320	Also, like the previous paper we discussed,
4990320	4994560	this study did not report IQ scores for the testees.
4994560	4996400	Those are simply concocted by Lin
4996400	4998880	out of the Raven's progressive matrices data,
4998880	5003120	using a sophisticated statistical technique called guessing.
5003120	5004960	So to understand what Lin has done here,
5004960	5009200	we need to talk a little about IQ test construction and standardization.
5009200	5011200	And let's start with the bell curve.
5011840	5015520	Not the book this time, but the statistical distribution.
5015520	5021040	Now, IQ tests, as we know, return this bell curve, or normal distribution.
5021040	5024800	This means that the majority of the scores are clustered around the middle
5024800	5028560	and taper off towards the ends of the curve in a symmetrical way.
5029120	5033280	But why, you might ask, do they actually return this distribution?
5033280	5035520	Well, it's because that's how they're designed.
5036080	5040800	Psychometricians design IQ tests so that their results match the bell curve.
5040800	5043040	If the test they design is too easy,
5043040	5044880	then the bell curve will lean to the right,
5044880	5047120	as too many people will get high scores.
5047680	5050240	If the test is too hard, it will lean to the left,
5050240	5052480	as too many people get low scores.
5052480	5056400	And if the test doesn't differentiate between people to the right degree,
5056400	5059840	then too many people could be at either end of the curve.
5059840	5063520	So the test designers tinker with the difficulty of the test
5063520	5065840	until the results match the bell curve.
5066400	5068960	So why do psychometricians do this?
5068960	5072240	Well, it's because that's how they assume intelligence is distributed
5072240	5074000	throughout the human population.
5074640	5076880	Emphasis on assume here,
5076880	5080400	because we do not actually know how intelligence is distributed
5080400	5082160	throughout the human population.
5082160	5084800	Unless you specifically design for it,
5084800	5088720	tests do not necessarily return a bell curve distribution.
5088720	5089840	For example here,
5089840	5093280	the armed forces qualifying test used in the bell curve
5093280	5095840	did not return a bell curve distribution.
5095840	5101200	It was, after all, designed to test readiness to join the armed forces, not IQ.
5101200	5105040	As a result, it does not differentiate between people to a large enough degree,
5105040	5109120	so Hernstein and Murray, to make the results conform to a bell curve,
5109120	5111280	recalculated the scores.
5111360	5116080	Here is a graph of the raw AFQT scores overlaid with Hernstein and Murray's
5116080	5120400	recalculated bell curve scores from the book Inequality by Design.
5120400	5123920	And as we can see, too many people scored too highly on the test
5123920	5126400	and there isn't enough differentiation between people
5126400	5128800	on the upper end of the scale in particular.
5128800	5130160	So yes, that's right.
5130160	5131840	In the book The Bell Curve,
5131840	5135120	the principal intelligence test the authors use as a source
5135120	5137600	did not return a bell curve distribution.
5137600	5140240	To transform these results into a bell curve,
5140240	5144800	Hernstein and Murray exaggerated the slight differences at the end of the scale.
5144800	5148880	They basically gave extra credit for being near the tails of the bell curve
5148880	5151120	and less for being in the middle.
5151120	5155600	They did this as they explain in Appendix 2 to correct for skew.
5155600	5158880	But remember, in relation to how intelligence is distributed
5158880	5160720	throughout the human population,
5160720	5163120	these results are only actually skewed
5163120	5167760	if we assume that intelligence is distributed in a bell curve to begin with.
5167760	5169520	This is circular logic.
5169520	5172880	We are assuming the result that we are going to get beforehand
5172880	5176480	and then designing the test or just manipulating the data
5176480	5178560	in order to reach that conclusion.
5178560	5180400	Anyway, to get back on track here,
5180400	5185120	what does all this have to do with Richard Lin and the Raven's progressive matrices test?
5185120	5189280	Well, that test also does not return a bell curve distribution.
5189280	5192640	The results are not symmetrically distributed around their mean,
5192640	5195600	to quote an article by psychologist Leon Kamin.
5195600	5199200	That article also notes that the test's developer, John Raven,
5199200	5204480	always insisted that the progressive matrices scores cannot be converted into IQs.
5204480	5207760	Here is an example of the distribution of matrix test scores
5207760	5212240	from Raven's paper, Standardization of Progressive Matrices 1938.
5212240	5216240	And as you can see, those are some very wobbly bell curves right there.
5216240	5221120	What the test does give is raw scores which correspond to percentile scores.
5221120	5225120	So you can know from your raw score how you compare percentile-wise
5225120	5227680	to the group on which the test was normalized.
5227760	5233040	But these percentiles will not be distributed evenly around their mean in a bell curve.
5233040	5237680	To calculate IQ, Richard Lin takes the average of these raw scores,
5237680	5240000	converts them to a percentile score,
5240000	5244720	and then gives what the IQ of that percentile score would correspond to
5244720	5248240	if the results were in a bell curve distribution.
5248240	5252560	Basically, Lin is assuming a bell curve exists where there demonstrably isn't one
5252560	5254800	and is forcing the data to fit it.
5254800	5258480	Another issue here is that in the decades since the Second World War,
5258480	5263760	scores on the Raven's matrices test similar to IQ test scores had been changing.
5263760	5267200	Accordingly, the test had been standardized several times.
5267200	5271200	So when we're comparing the African results with Western norms,
5271200	5274080	we need to identify what norm group we're using
5274080	5279280	because comparisons with different groups from different times could give different results.
5279280	5284000	Particularly sharp-eyed viewers would have noticed that Lin does exactly this
5284000	5286320	in the quote from his 2002 book,
5286320	5289200	IQ and the Wealth of Nations, which I showed earlier,
5289200	5292160	where he discusses Nigerian IQs, quote,
5292160	5296000	in terms of the British 1979 standardization.
5296560	5299600	Identifying this standardization is important,
5299600	5305040	as using a different one could lead to a different Nigerian IQ being calculated.
5305040	5309520	In his 1991 review of the literature cited in the bell curve, however,
5309520	5315440	Lin does not identify what standardization he's using for the various tests he is comparing.
5315440	5318640	What this means is that there is a gap in Lin's calculations
5318640	5322480	that can only be filled by faith in his academic honesty,
5322480	5324720	which Hearnstein and Murray clearly have,
5324720	5327520	but I must confess that I do not.
5327520	5331040	Anyway, if you think what Lin did to those last two studies was bad,
5331040	5334240	strap in, because this next one is a real bastard.
5334240	5339600	South Africa IQ of 69, attributed to Owen, 1989,
5339600	5344240	which Lin calls the single best study of the Negroid Intelligence.
5345520	5347520	So this is test and item bias,
5347520	5351520	the suitability of the junior aptitude tests as a common test battery
5351520	5354560	for white, Indian, and black pupils in standard 7.
5354560	5357600	Owen is not one for catchy names, apparently.
5357600	5360000	The abstract to this study starts out,
5360000	5362560	This study was undertaken to shed light on problems
5362560	5365360	concerning the construction and use of a common test battery
5365360	5367920	for various South African population groups.
5367920	5370480	You see, this study is testing a test,
5370480	5373600	the Junior Aptitude Test, or JAT,
5373600	5376880	which was standardized for white pupils in South Africa
5376880	5380800	and determining whether it's also a good test to give to non-white groups.
5380800	5386000	The study selected various schools in South Africa for white, Indian, and black students.
5386000	5387120	Although it should be mentioned,
5387200	5390480	it was not able to use the majority of the selected black schools,
5390480	5390960	quote,
5390960	5396640	and thus they had to test black schools in the KwaZulu region,
5396640	5401840	one of the areas designated for black inhabitants of South Africa under apartheid.
5401840	5404800	I mention the unrest situation here as a reminder that,
5404800	5407840	yes, these tests are being carried out under apartheid,
5407840	5413040	and protests and demonstrations against the segregated school system were ongoing.
5413040	5415600	So anyway, the study examined pupils' performances
5415600	5418640	on the various sub-tests comprising the JAT,
5418640	5420160	and what were the findings?
5420160	5422160	Well, the thing I think we should mention first here
5422160	5426480	is that the tests were given to the black students in KwaZulu in English only,
5426480	5431600	and several test sections of the JAT relied very heavily upon language ability.
5431600	5435120	Now, Owen expected language ability not to matter in the tests
5435120	5437760	because the black students in the KwaZulu region
5437760	5441120	had ostensibly been learning English in their schools.
5441120	5443760	Owen apparently either doesn't know or disregards
5443760	5447120	that these schools often didn't have necessary teaching equipment,
5447120	5449760	only a small amount of their teachers were certified,
5449760	5453440	and that pupil-teacher ratios were more than double that of the white schools.
5453440	5454720	And to quote the study,
5454720	5459920	language was not expected to play a significant role in test performance in this investigation.
5459920	5463760	However, the results showed that this assumption was completely wrong.
5463760	5466480	In fact, language played such an important role,
5466480	5470080	and the knowledge of English of the majority of black testees was so poor
5470080	5473760	that certain tests, for example the JAT-4 synonyms
5473760	5478640	and the JAT-8 memory paragraph, proved to be virtually unusable.
5479360	5481200	And let me just quote that again.
5481200	5484960	Certain tests proved to be virtually unusable.
5484960	5486800	Owen also writes elsewhere,
5486800	5491520	the results of the current investigation clearly show that language played a prominent role
5491520	5494160	in all the tests containing language items,
5494160	5498640	which is a wonderful multiple stab wounds shown to shorten life expectancy,
5498640	5501280	bit of academic obviousness there.
5501280	5506400	Language ability was not the only way in which the Junior Aptitude Test was biased, however.
5506400	5509840	In a section entitled Item Bias in the Tests of the JAT,
5509840	5514880	Owen notes several ways in which the tests were culturally and economically biased.
5514880	5520320	For example, he here lists several test items on the first test in the JAT and states,
5520320	5524560	A common element in most of these items was that they presuppose knowledge
5524560	5527440	or a degree of knowledge on the part of the testee,
5527440	5530480	and mentions such things as electrical appliances,
5530480	5534400	microscopes, and Western types of ladies' accessories.
5534400	5535680	Going on to write,
5535680	5538560	Thus in the case of both the Indian and Black testees,
5538560	5542400	it seems that the single largest cause of bias lay in the fact that the pupils
5542400	5546240	were not familiar with the objects represented by the pictures.
5546240	5551440	Cultural and socioeconomic status factors probably also played a role in this regard.
5551440	5553600	So this test is biased, then.
5553600	5556800	The study examining it says it is biased,
5556800	5558480	but according to Richard Lin,
5558480	5562960	this is the single best study of the Negroid Intelligence.
5562960	5564480	This is the best one.
5564480	5568800	The one that tests segregated school children in a non-native language
5568800	5571760	and calls its own results virtually unusable.
5571760	5572800	In Lin's review,
5572800	5576720	this is the most important study for his estimates of Black African IQ.
5577280	5578800	Writing about it, he says,
5578800	5584320	The mean IQ of the sample in comparison with Caucasoid South African norms is 69.
5584320	5588160	It is also around the median of the studies listed in Table 3.
5588160	5591360	It is proposed, therefore, to round this figure up to 70.
5592400	5593120	Why?
5593120	5597280	And take this as the approximate mean for pure Negroids.
5597280	5598320	God damn.
5598320	5600800	What Lin has done here is ridiculous.
5600800	5606560	He has taken 11 studies from a period between 1929 and 1991,
5606560	5611360	with vastly different sample sizes reporting data from different tests,
5611360	5614480	most of which didn't even report IQ scores,
5614480	5619040	transformed the data into what he reckons the equivalent IQ scores were
5619040	5621600	using some unknown standardization,
5621600	5624240	picked one that was sort of near the middle,
5624240	5626960	and said that's the average Black African IQ.
5627600	5629920	This is outrageous.
5629920	5631440	It is a crime.
5631440	5634720	It might actually be a crime, and if it's not, it should be.
5634720	5637600	Now, I am far from the first person to criticize
5637600	5640480	the Bell Curve's reliance upon Richard Lin as a source.
5640960	5644960	Various academics were already well aware of Lin and his dodgy data,
5644960	5647040	so when Herrnstein and Murray cited him,
5647040	5651840	they were immediately attacked with accusations of bias and racism.
5651840	5655840	Charles Murray responds to these attacks in the afterword to the Bell Curve,
5655840	5657520	and his defense is laughable.
5657520	5660800	His first defense is to say that the topic of African IQ
5660800	5666080	is a tiny piece of the Bell Curve, three paragraphs on pages 288 to 89,
5666080	5669520	and in regards to this, two responses jump to mind immediately.
5669600	5674160	The first is to say, well, maybe you should have spent longer on it then, Charles.
5674160	5676000	We were wrong very quickly.
5676000	5678640	Isn't a defense against being wrong, is it?
5678640	5680400	Maybe if you put a little more effort in,
5680400	5683520	you would have seen that Lin's paper was a load of rubbish.
5683520	5688160	Secondly, this part of the Bell Curve is far more important than Murray makes out.
5688160	5691200	He uses Lin's paper to dismiss the arguments
5691200	5695360	that black-white differences in IQ are caused by environmental factors,
5695360	5697120	such as a history of oppression,
5697120	5699920	which is the single most common counterargument
5699920	5702880	to one of the principal claims in the entire book.
5702880	5707440	At no point does Murray actually address any specific criticisms of Lin's work
5707440	5709520	or any of its various errors.
5709520	5714560	He mainly just seems outraged that anyone dares to have criticized him at all, to be honest.
5714560	5717280	And it's exactly this sort of academic laziness
5717280	5720480	that fed much of the angry response to the Bell Curve.
5720480	5723600	Murray refuses to admit that citing Lin was a mistake,
5723600	5728720	and simply throws out some newer studies that supposedly show he was right anyway.
5728720	5729760	So there.
5729760	5732000	This speaks to a couple of things.
5732000	5736320	Firstly, it is a fatal underestimation of exactly how badly this damages
5736320	5740000	the faith that a reader of the Bell Curve can have in its authors.
5740000	5743120	After all, this is not the only time they cite Richard Lin.
5743120	5746240	He has more than 20 citations in their bibliography,
5746240	5749040	and they thank him specifically in the acknowledgments.
5749040	5753520	If this is the sort of data that Charles Murray is willing to accept as legitimate,
5753520	5756800	how can we trust anything he says anywhere in the book?
5756800	5760320	How can we trust the new studies he brings up to defend Richard Lin?
5760960	5765920	Personally, I think it would be a mistake to even look at these new studies.
5765920	5769360	Murray's response to having his previous sources called into question
5769360	5771760	is to simply throw out new sources.
5771760	5776400	His response to having these called into question would no doubt be to throw out more.
5776400	5780560	The responsibility for checking whether his sources are trustworthy or accurate
5780560	5783760	has been moved from Murray to his critics.
5783760	5786160	They're the ones doing the reading and the fact-checking,
5786160	5788800	whereas he never gets held to account.
5788800	5794000	So long as we all understand that, however, I suppose we can take a brief peek.
5794000	5795200	So, Murray says,
5795200	5800880	Let me turn to two studies post-dating Richard Lin's review that we cite on page 289.
5800880	5803600	One was a South African study led by Kenneth Owen,
5803600	5808320	published in the refereed British journal Personality and Individual Differences.
5808320	5812320	So this was the suitability of Raven's standard progressive matrices
5812320	5814480	for various groups in South Africa,
5814480	5818080	a paper that was published in 1992.
5818080	5821280	So we are still in apartheid South Africa.
5821280	5824960	And this study tested black students from the KwaZulu region,
5824960	5828080	the same as one of the studies from Richard Lin's review.
5828080	5830080	It even has the same author.
5830080	5833680	So this is not a great showing with the first study here.
5833680	5836080	Murray introduces the other study by saying,
5836160	5838480	The second example of a recent careful study
5838480	5842800	was conducted by a black scholar, Fred Cindy, and published in The Psychologist.
5842800	5845920	It matched 204 black Zimbabwean pupils
5845920	5849600	and 202 white English students from London inner-city schools
5849600	5854240	for age, 12 to 14 years old, sex, and educational level,
5854240	5857200	both samples being characterized as working class,
5857200	5859920	and then goes on to say that the white students from London
5859920	5864240	got higher test results than the black students from Zimbabwe.
5864240	5868800	However, Murray takes the cue from Richard Lin and leaves out all the context.
5868800	5873440	The main thing here being that Zimbabwe was a British colony known as Rhodesia
5873440	5878720	until it gained independence in 1980, following a 15-year civil war.
5879280	5883280	Rhodesia was a discriminatory racially segregated state.
5883280	5889360	12 to 14-year-olds in 1994 would have been born around the time of Zimbabwe's independence
5889360	5894080	to parents who were raised and educated in a segregated British colony.
5894320	5898560	Which makes the comparison to the children of London as all the more ridiculous here.
5898560	5901680	The children of the colonized country are being measured
5901680	5904480	against the children of the colonizing country.
5904480	5907040	Fred Cindy, the professor who offered the study,
5907040	5910080	more recently spoke about his earlier work in the following way.
5910720	5913760	For many years, African countries have depended upon the use
5913760	5916080	of Western-designed psychometric instruments
5916080	5919920	such as Raven's progressive matrices and some others.
5919920	5924720	Such tests, standardized in Western cultures using Western cultural values,
5924720	5927600	have been found to be useful to a certain extent.
5927600	5931760	In many cases, interpretation of results from Western-designed tests
5931760	5937120	have however been distorted to suit Western stereotypes about other nations.
5937120	5939120	Cindy 1994.
5939120	5943680	A very important point which Lin and Murray would do well to take on board.
5944240	5948560	Murray reveals a misunderstanding of the criticisms raised against the bell curve
5948560	5952000	when he goes on to say that the problem is not as often alleged
5952000	5954880	that such studies are written by racists.
5954880	5956640	In the two instances just cited,
5956640	5961040	a charge belied by Owen's scholarly reputation and by Cindy's race,
5961040	5964000	but that the African story is still so incomplete.
5964640	5966240	What Murray gets wrong here,
5966240	5969200	beyond the implication that a scholarly reputation
5969200	5972000	could not also be accompanied by racism,
5972000	5976160	is that the allegation is not that these studies are written by racists.
5976160	5979280	It's that the studies are being deliberately misinterpreted
5979280	5982080	and misrepresented by racists.
5982080	5984000	Racists like Richard Lin,
5984000	5986960	who stripped from the studies all context and analysis
5986960	5989840	and used them to push a racist worldview.
5989840	5993520	Murray fails to see that the problem is not that it is impossible
5993520	5998000	to find other studies that have similar results to the ones cited in the bell curve.
5998000	6003200	It's that he's willing to treat data collected in a segregated white supremacist state
6003200	6008000	as a legitimate source to inform us about inherent racial differences.
6008000	6009840	That is the issue here.
6009840	6011120	On a more general note,
6011120	6014240	what Murray writes in the afterword and how he writes it
6014240	6016880	shows us exactly how little respect he has
6016880	6019680	for what should be treated as a sensitive topic.
6020240	6023120	The subject of his writing is potential differences
6023120	6025920	in native ability between racial groups,
6025920	6029360	and discussing that requires a level of tact and consideration
6029360	6031680	that is totally absent here.
6031680	6035120	You cannot half-ass the science with this stuff.
6035120	6039920	Murray's refusal to respond directly to criticism of his sources here
6039920	6042160	exposes him as a fraud.
6042160	6045920	We're going to move on now and consider how the bell curve measures intelligence
6045920	6049920	against socioeconomic status in determining one's life outcomes.
6049920	6052560	But I'd like you to keep in mind, if possible,
6052560	6055040	several of the things we've talked about so far.
6055040	6057680	The difficulty in defining intelligence.
6057680	6060480	The difficulties in testing for intelligence.
6060480	6064160	The bell curve's missing genetic evidence for IQ.
6064160	6066880	And of course, the incredibly shoddy sources
6066880	6070560	that Hernstein and Murray are apparently willing to accept.
6070560	6074000	When we see a graph measuring intelligence against environment,
6074000	6076880	we should not be fooled into thinking that that intelligence
6076880	6080160	was legitimately or accurately calculated.
6080160	6081440	Anyway, to the claim.
6081440	6085280	One's IQ is more important than one's social background
6085280	6087280	in determining one's life outcomes.
6087920	6091600	To address this claim, we first need to define the terms.
6091600	6094480	We know by now how Hernstein and Murray have been determining
6094480	6096720	the IQ of the people they're examining
6096720	6100240	by using their scores on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test.
6100240	6103360	But in order to make comparisons to their IQ,
6103360	6107840	how is the bell curve determining those people's socioeconomic status?
6107840	6113920	Let's take as an example poverty from Chapter 5 of the bell curve titled Poverty.
6113920	6116800	Hernstein and Murray want to compare low intelligence
6116800	6120480	with low socioeconomic status as causes for poverty
6120480	6123040	to figure out which is more important.
6123040	6128240	They use the survey respondents' AFQT scores as their data for intelligence,
6128240	6131760	and they use socioeconomic information provided by the respondents
6131760	6135840	to build what they call an index of socioeconomic status.
6136640	6139360	Both of these are then compared with the likelihood of the respondents
6139360	6141760	being below the poverty line a decade later.
6141760	6144560	And of course, Hernstein and Murray find that intelligence
6144560	6146960	is the better predictor of poverty.
6146960	6150240	So I guess we'd better examine exactly how Hernstein and Murray
6150240	6153520	constructed their index of socioeconomic status.
6153520	6158160	But before we get to that, I'd like to propose a question for us to answer.
6158160	6160960	What environmental factors would you deem important
6160960	6164880	with regards to the likelihood of a young person being in poverty?
6164880	6167760	And let's discuss a few possibilities here.
6167760	6170480	First up, parental socioeconomic status,
6170480	6175360	which is usually defined as their level of education, occupation, and income.
6175360	6178000	I think we'd all agree that is fairly important.
6178000	6181680	Families that have a larger income are less likely to be in poverty.
6181680	6184640	Better educated parents are more likely to have better jobs
6184640	6187200	and therefore less likely to have children in poverty.
6187200	6188960	This is rather straightforward.
6188960	6191280	Family composition is important.
6191280	6193840	A family with a particular income and living space
6193840	6196720	stretched to take care of six children, say,
6196720	6200160	is gonna have a harder time than a family with the same income and living space
6200160	6202480	but only one child to take care of.
6202480	6204960	So number of siblings is important,
6204960	6209200	as is whether or not the individual was raised in a two-parent family.
6209200	6211680	Two parents typically means more resources
6211680	6214080	and therefore less chance of being in poverty.
6214080	6216960	The area where someone lives is very important.
6216960	6220960	One family with a particular income might have a very different living experience
6220960	6225120	to another family with the same income that lives in a different area.
6225120	6227520	And this could be for a variety of reasons.
6227520	6232640	Average living expenses like rent, food, and other costs that vary from place to place,
6232640	6235760	the average crime rate, the unemployment rate,
6235760	6239600	that can be very important for determining one's chance of being in poverty.
6239600	6241200	Seems fairly obvious to mention,
6241200	6243920	but you're gonna have an easier time finding an income
6243920	6247680	in an area with many jobs than an area with few jobs.
6247680	6251680	Another reason the area someone lives is important to us here is school quality,
6251680	6253600	which should be particularly noteworthy,
6253600	6257040	given that we're measuring all of this against performance on an academic test.
6257680	6260400	How long someone stays in school is also important,
6260400	6262800	and how many years of education they completed
6262800	6266480	both before and after taking the armed forces qualifying test.
6266480	6270640	Familial wealth is important, and this is a separate issue to income.
6270640	6272400	One person with a particular income,
6272400	6276720	whose rich parents bought them a house and a car and paid their way through college,
6276720	6280160	is gonna have a different experience to a person on the same income,
6280160	6283440	but who has to pay off debt related to all of those things.
6284000	6287120	Overall, economic trends can be very important.
6287120	6290560	You are more likely to be in poverty during a recession.
6290560	6293520	The reason that the poverty rate increases during recessions
6293520	6297440	is not because everyone collectively loses a few IQ points, is it?
6298000	6302000	And the effects of recession are felt unequally across economic classes
6302000	6303920	and different geographical areas.
6304480	6306560	One's gender is important.
6306560	6310000	Women, for example, are more likely to be in poverty than men are.
6310000	6314880	Now, whether you believe this is because women have lower genetic IQs than men do,
6314880	6318640	or you're sensible and you believe it's because of environmental reasons,
6318640	6319840	it is the case.
6319840	6322160	I should note here that I'm excluding race
6322160	6324560	because this chapter of the bell curve concerns itself
6324560	6327680	with only the white respondents to the AFQT.
6327680	6330160	Your health is important, of course.
6330160	6333760	People with disabilities, for instance, are more likely to be in poverty,
6333760	6337600	and particularly in the US, the cost of medical care and health insurance
6337600	6341040	can massively affect someone's likelihood of being in poverty.
6341040	6344640	And we could go on listing things, but we will arbitrarily stop here.
6344880	6346720	I trust you get the point by now.
6346720	6349040	There are lots of different things to consider
6349040	6352000	when attempting to determine how someone's environment
6352000	6354480	might contribute to them being in poverty.
6354480	6356880	Which brings us back to the bell curve.
6356880	6359040	Which of the various factors on this list
6359040	6361280	did Hernstein and Murray think were important
6361280	6365360	with regards to the likelihood of a young person being in poverty?
6366400	6367280	The first one.
6367920	6369120	Yep, that's all.
6369760	6372720	Hernstein and Murray's consideration of environmental factors
6372720	6375920	extends to parental education, income, and occupation.
6375920	6376880	That's all.
6376880	6378160	As far as they're concerned,
6378160	6380960	with regards to the determining predictors of poverty,
6380960	6383280	all the other things on this list have no effect.
6383280	6385040	Your family's wealth has no effect.
6385040	6387360	Family composition, the area where you live,
6387360	6391760	the quality of the school you went to, the crime rate, all irrelevant.
6391760	6395520	What they have done here is substitute environmental factors
6395520	6398240	for parental socioeconomic status,
6398240	6401680	which is a much narrower category of variables.
6401680	6405360	They simply add together parental education, income, and occupation,
6405360	6409760	call that parental socioeconomic status, and plot it against IQ.
6409760	6411680	And this is the graph they come up with.
6411680	6414800	The comparative roles of IQ and parental SES
6414800	6418560	in determining whether young white adults are below the poverty line.
6418560	6421840	It shows that people with low IQs are more likely to be in poverty
6421840	6424400	than people whose parents had a low SES.
6424400	6425760	And also the reverse.
6425760	6428400	High IQ people are less likely to be in poverty
6428400	6431200	than people whose parents had a high SES.
6431200	6433520	Cognitive ability is more important
6433520	6437760	than parental socioeconomic status in determining poverty, they say.
6437760	6439520	But of course, as we have seen,
6439520	6443840	their consideration of environmental factors here is laughably narrow.
6444400	6446640	They only want to consider as valid things
6446640	6449840	that fall under their definition of parental SES.
6449840	6453040	And they ignore all the other relevant environmental factors.
6453600	6457680	What would happen to this graph if we also considered the various other things
6457680	6460880	that Hernstein and Murray leave out of their analysis?
6460960	6464640	Now, I don't know how to do regression analysis, unfortunately,
6464640	6467840	but the book Inequality by Design was written by some people
6467840	6470000	who do know how to do regression analysis,
6470000	6472880	and they do exactly what we're looking for here.
6472880	6477600	Firstly, they recreate Hernstein and Murray's calculations using their data.
6477600	6481040	They then use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Responses
6481040	6484880	to add more environmental data to the analysis.
6484880	6490080	Their first updated graph changes parental SES to parental home environment,
6490080	6492880	adding for consideration things like the number of siblings
6492880	6495360	and whether the household has two parents.
6495360	6500800	As we can see, AFQT score is still more important than parental home environment,
6500800	6503680	but now the two are much closer together.
6503680	6507280	Next up, they add community environment to home environment,
6507280	6510720	considering the region where the respondent lived when they took the test
6510720	6512640	and the school that they attended.
6512640	6517280	Doing this, we see that AFQT score and social environment are now equal.
6518000	6521840	Next, they add for consideration the number of years of education
6521840	6524000	of the respondents to the survey.
6524000	6526480	And by now, the AFQT score has slipped
6526480	6529840	below the combined environmental factors in importance.
6529840	6534000	Using the same statistical methods and data set as the bell curve,
6534000	6537760	Inequality by Design's analysis shows that environmental factors
6537760	6540480	are more important than AFQT score
6540480	6543440	in determining the probability of being in poverty.
6543440	6546800	And this is shown using only the limited data available
6546800	6549840	in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, remember.
6549840	6553120	Inequality by Design adds to the analysis only a few
6553120	6558160	of the conceivable socioeconomic factors that are ignored by Hernstein and Murray.
6558160	6561920	If we were to continue adding in available factors to consider,
6561920	6565120	the effect of IQ would get weaker and weaker.
6565120	6568960	And lest you think Inequality by Design's analysis was a one-off,
6568960	6574240	the authors of Intelligence, Genes, and Success also reanalyzed the NLSY data,
6574240	6576640	and with regards to how much cognitive ability
6576640	6580800	accounts for differences in wages between people, say the following.
6580800	6584640	However, our results conflict with the predictions of Hernstein and Murray.
6584640	6588240	Ability factors other than G are economically useful.
6588240	6591920	Compared with education, family background, and region of residence,
6591920	6594880	G explains little of the variance in wages.
6594880	6598800	If there exists some X factor that can explain the large residuals
6598800	6603040	common in wage regressions, it is not measured cognitive ability.
6603040	6608000	In summary, our re-analyses of the NLSY data originally analyzed by Hernstein and Murray
6608000	6611440	show measured cognitive ability is correlated with wages,
6611440	6616080	but explains little of the variance in wages across individuals and time.
6616080	6621280	Later in this chapter, Hernstein and Murray use this same narrowly defined parental SES
6621280	6625520	to consider which young people will drop out of school, get a college degree,
6625520	6629920	be unemployed, have children out of wedlock, be on welfare, and so on.
6629920	6633360	To be fair, sometimes they do add other factors to consider,
6633360	6639360	but again, only when they personally, subjectively, decide those factors are important.
6639360	6644160	All their comparisons between IQ and SES that inform their later policy proposals
6644160	6647440	are based upon this calculated decision to not consider
6647440	6650400	the full range of relevant environmental factors.
6650400	6654480	And there's two other important points that we have to keep in mind here.
6654480	6658160	The first is that we have been assuming that AFQT score
6658160	6660960	is a legitimate stand-in for cognitive ability,
6660960	6665520	which, given all the potential problems with intelligence testing we've already discussed,
6665520	6667120	is a bit of a stretch.
6667120	6671680	The second thing we need to remember is that Hernstein and Murray's estimation of IQ
6671680	6675600	is that it is only 60% genetically heritable.
6675600	6679680	That would mean, according to their flawed understanding of heritability anyway,
6679680	6686720	that 40% of the IQ score in their calculations originated from environmental factors.
6686720	6692320	Considering all these things together, the case for IQ here is looking incredibly flimsy.
6692320	6697600	So as we've seen, once you add more factors to consider, environment trumps IQ.
6698240	6703200	So we now have to ask, is this a legitimate thing to do, statistically speaking?
6703200	6706720	The bell curve anticipates being criticized in this manner.
6706720	6710880	In a section titled, But What About Other Explanations?, they write,
6710880	6715680	We can already hear critics saying, if only they'd added this other variable to the analysis,
6715680	6718560	they would have seen that intelligence has nothing to do with x.
6719200	6723440	At this point, however, statistical analysis can become a bottomless pit.
6723440	6727840	It is not uncommon in technical journals to read articles built around the estimated effects
6727840	6730560	of a dozen or more independent variables.
6730560	6735280	Sometimes the entire set of variables is loaded into a single regression equation.
6735280	6739760	Sometimes sets of equations are used, modeling even more complex relationships
6739760	6743600	in which all the variables can exert mutual effects on one another.
6743600	6745280	Why should we not press forward?
6745280	6750480	Why not also ask if religious background has an effect on the decision to go on welfare, for example?
6750480	6754880	It's an interesting question, as are 50 others that might come to mind.
6754880	6757680	This is the first of two defenses by Hanstein and Murray,
6757680	6761920	where they argue that it would just be too complicated to consider all the factors.
6762480	6768000	Why there could be 50 environmental variables affecting someone's likelihood of being in poverty,
6768000	6769600	that's just too many.
6769600	6771200	It would be too complex.
6771200	6774000	Our graph wouldn't make any sense if we did that.
6774000	6778080	So instead of 50, we're just gonna consider, I don't know, two.
6778080	6781200	This is a result of treating the method of investigation
6781200	6784480	as more important than getting accurate results.
6784480	6788240	If you can't use regression analysis to fairly compare IQ
6788240	6791760	to all the relevant environmental factors, don't.
6792320	6794880	You know, you don't actually have to do this.
6795440	6799440	Hanstein and Murray's second defense is even more telling than the first.
6800080	6802800	Our principle was to explore additional dynamics
6802800	6806480	when there was another factor that was not only conceivably important,
6806480	6809440	but for clear logical reasons might be important
6809440	6812800	because of dynamics having little or nothing to do with IQ.
6813680	6815440	This last proviso is crucial,
6815440	6818560	for one of the most common misuses of regression analysis
6818560	6820800	is to introduce an additional variable
6820800	6826800	that in reality is mostly another expression of variables that are already in the equation.
6826800	6830320	So what Hanstein and Murray are saying is that they dismissed variables
6830320	6834480	if they deemed them to merely be mostly expressions of IQ,
6834480	6836640	which is already in the equation.
6837440	6839440	They only considered additional factors
6839440	6841760	when they had little or nothing to do with IQ
6841760	6844560	and were, quote, conceivably important.
6844560	6846480	Which should lead us to ask a question.
6846480	6851520	How are Hanstein and Murray deciding which variables are conceivably important?
6851520	6854880	And how are they deciding how much they have to do with IQ?
6854880	6858000	And the answer, of course, is subjectively.
6858000	6862240	They're only considering things that they reckon are important.
6862240	6865440	You see, the problem with Hanstein and Murray dismissing variables
6865440	6870400	that they have subjectively decided are merely expressions of cognitive ability here
6870400	6876000	is that they think that socioeconomic status itself is an expression of cognitive ability.
6876000	6881200	Later in the book, when criticizing the practice of controlling for SES between racial groups,
6881200	6881920	they write,
6881920	6887040	the difficulty comes in interpreting what it means to control for socioeconomic status.
6887040	6890320	Matching the status of the groups is usually justified on the grounds
6890320	6895440	that the scores people earn are caused to some extent by their socioeconomic status.
6895440	6899360	So if we want to see the real or authentic difference between them,
6899360	6902240	the contribution of status must be excluded.
6902240	6907600	The trouble is that socioeconomic status is also a result of cognitive ability,
6907600	6909680	as people of high and low cognitive ability
6909680	6913760	move to correspondingly high and low places in the socioeconomic continuum.
6913760	6916000	Now, this is circular logic.
6916000	6919840	Hanstein and Murray claim to be limiting which factors they're considering
6919840	6924240	to avoid including those which are merely expressions of other factors,
6924240	6929600	but their main comparison here is between cognitive ability and socioeconomic status,
6929600	6933760	which they elsewhere argue is a result of cognitive ability.
6933760	6940000	Using this framework, where cognitive ability determines both IQ and socioeconomic status,
6940000	6943120	the whole series of comparisons from this chapter of the bell curve
6943120	6945440	seems cynical and unnecessary.
6945520	6950000	Hanstein and Murray have already decided what conclusion they're gonna come to,
6950000	6954080	that cognitive ability is more important than all the other variables,
6954080	6958240	and all their statistical comparisons read as them just going through the motions
6958240	6959680	to get that result.
6959680	6964880	In simply declaring socioeconomic status the result of cognitive ability,
6964880	6968720	the bell curve brings to mind the chicken and egg problem here.
6969280	6971440	You see, a lot of disagreements over IQ
6971440	6974960	stem from different interpretations of the same data.
6974960	6978320	Let's say you do a study which proves a strong positive correlation
6978320	6982720	between the amount of time someone has spent in education and their IQ,
6982720	6985840	and you present those findings to two groups of people.
6985840	6988720	One group that favors environmental explanations
6988720	6991600	and one that favors genetic explanations.
6991600	6994720	Now, of course, the environmentalists will say,
6994720	6996960	this result makes perfect sense.
6996960	6999840	The longer you're in education, the more things you learn,
6999840	7003920	the better you get at answering the sorts of questions that show up on IQ tests,
7003920	7008080	the more familiar you are with taking academic tests in the first place.
7008080	7011200	IQ clearly stems from environment.
7011200	7014240	The genetic-minded folks, on the other hand, will say,
7014240	7017280	of course, this result makes perfect sense.
7017280	7020480	People with higher IQs favor an academic environment,
7020480	7022800	and they're more likely to stay in school longer
7022800	7025200	because that's the smarter thing to do.
7025200	7027680	Since they have higher IQs to begin with,
7027680	7029920	they will naturally make better choices.
7029920	7033280	Environment clearly stems from IQ.
7033280	7036560	So which came first, the chicken or the egg?
7036560	7038800	Environment or cognitive ability?
7038800	7040800	We can phrase this two ways.
7040800	7044320	A parent's higher cognitive ability leads to a better environment,
7044320	7048080	which again leads to a higher cognitive ability in their children.
7048080	7050240	Or we can say that a better environment
7050240	7052560	leads to a parent's higher cognitive ability,
7052560	7055920	which then produces a better environment for their children.
7055920	7058720	But both of these ways of phrasing are merely presenting
7058720	7063600	a segment of the overall environment-cognitive ability logic chain.
7063600	7066160	The bell curve solves the conundrum of whether
7066160	7069360	cognitive ability or environment should come first by saying...
7070080	7071200	cognitive ability.
7071920	7072720	That's first.
7072720	7076080	We like that one the most, so that's the one that comes first.
7076080	7078480	But of course, this is completely arbitrary,
7078480	7081440	and also, ultimately, incorrect.
7081440	7085120	To understand this, we need to talk about another of the main problems
7085120	7088000	with the scientific arguments of the bell curve,
7088000	7091920	which is that Herrnstein and Murray are conspicuously uninterested
7091920	7094880	in the causes of the things that they're talking about.
7095840	7098720	Much of the bell curve, for instance, is concerned with proving
7098720	7101840	that there are substantial differences in cognitive ability
7101840	7104400	between different designated racial groups.
7104400	7108160	But what Herrnstein and Murray never seriously concern themselves with
7108160	7111120	is why this supposed divergence happened.
7111120	7115520	Population groups don't evolve to be different for no reason, do they?
7115520	7118960	If one group developed better cognitive skills than another group,
7118960	7120960	there would have to be some mechanism there
7120960	7124400	that was leading to higher cognitive ability in that group,
7124400	7128240	or, I suppose, leading to lower cognitive ability in the other group.
7128240	7131280	Now, this could simply be direct evolutionary pressure,
7131280	7134320	as in different levels of cognitive ability in different groups
7134320	7136800	are being directly selected for.
7136800	7139520	Or it could be an indirect, unintended effect
7139520	7141680	of a different trait being selected for,
7141680	7143840	or some sort of genetic drift,
7143840	7146320	as generations of different population groups
7146320	7148320	are isolated enough from each other
7148320	7151360	to develop in significantly different ways.
7151360	7155120	Whatever the reason, though, there would have to be a reason.
7155120	7158080	And we should expect a scientist attempting to argue
7158080	7161360	for a substantial difference in ability between different groups
7161360	7166560	to therefore maybe be interested in exactly why this difference came about, right?
7167120	7169520	One of the only times that Herrnstein and Murray
7169520	7171440	show any interest in this question
7171440	7173920	is in Appendix Five, where they discuss the work
7173920	7177200	of Canadian psychologist J. Philippe Rushton,
7177200	7181760	who wrote the book Race, Evolution, and Behavior in 1995.
7181760	7186720	Rushton alleges that brain and genital size are inversely related,
7186720	7190800	and that larger genitals correlate with an increased fertility.
7190800	7195280	So at some point, different designated racial groups diverged from one another
7195280	7199760	and developed different traits according to some sort of trade-off system.
7199760	7202560	So it's like a computer game where you have limited points
7202560	7204240	to put into your starting stats,
7204240	7208640	only here the starting stats are int and genital size.
7209440	7214400	In 1988, Rushton was reprimanded by the University of Western Ontario
7214400	7217120	for carrying out two particular studies.
7217120	7219760	He surveyed first-year psychology students
7219760	7222960	and then male customers at a Toronto shopping mall,
7222960	7225600	asking them questions about their sex lives,
7225600	7227440	the size of their penises,
7227440	7230560	and the exact distance that they ejaculate.
7231440	7234000	Now, I can only speak for myself here,
7234640	7236640	but I can't say I've ever measured.
7237760	7242080	One therefore wonders how reliable this self-reported data could be.
7242800	7245760	Or, who knows, maybe I'm the anomaly here.
7245760	7250320	Maybe all you penis-havers out there are keeping detailed daily statistics.
7250320	7251360	I don't know.
7251360	7257200	One also wonders about exactly how distance is supposed to come into play here.
7257440	7259200	For want of a better phrase.
7259760	7263680	What does this Rushton guy think is going on in the bedroom?
7263680	7267280	Does he think you have to hit a moving target or something?
7267280	7267840	I don't know.
7268560	7272480	Rushton's work also uses the same caucasoid, mongoloid,
7272480	7275680	negroid categorization that Richard Limb uses.
7275680	7277920	And to quote a response to Rushton's theories
7277920	7280480	by Canadian psychologist Zach Cenovsky,
7281280	7284000	some of Rushton's references to scientific literature
7284000	7287200	with respects to racial differences and sexual characteristics
7287200	7292480	turned out to be references to a non-scientific semi-pornographic book
7292480	7295120	and to an article in the penthouse forum.
7295840	7299280	I am mentioning Rushton and his weird genital theories here,
7299280	7302640	not just because they're funny to relate, which they certainly are,
7302640	7306640	but because he and his research are defended in the bell curve.
7306640	7309760	Herrnstein and Murray relay his ideas before stating,
7309840	7319920	However, Rushton's work is not that of a crackpot or a bigot,
7319920	7322320	as many of his critics are given to charging.
7322880	7324720	But they're wrong there, of course.
7324720	7327280	He is a crackpot and a bigot.
7327280	7329760	Or he was, anyway. He's dead now.
7329760	7332960	As for why Herrnstein and Murray seem so disinterested
7332960	7336160	in examining causes for the things that they're discussing,
7336160	7337920	I can only speculate here.
7337920	7342080	But I suspect it's because, at least with regards to the bell curve, anyway,
7342080	7345280	Herrnstein and Murray are not scientists.
7345280	7350080	They didn't even submit the bell curve for peer review prior to its publication.
7350080	7354240	They are here to advance a conservative social and political agenda,
7354240	7359280	and all the air quotes science is just window dressing for that agenda.
7359280	7361520	And that's what we're going to talk about next.
7361520	7364560	So then, the politics of the bell curve.
7364640	7369920	And I'd like to first talk a bit more about why the bell curve was so controversial.
7369920	7375520	And there's one main reason comprised of two, uh, sub reasons.
7376160	7379520	The first is that Herrnstein and Murray spend a large part of their book
7379520	7384080	asserting differences in intelligence between designated racial groups.
7384080	7386800	And we have to wonder why they even did this,
7386800	7389840	because it isn't important at all for their overall point.
7390480	7394080	Their main argument is that IQ is the most important factor
7394080	7396400	determining success or failure in life,
7396400	7400080	and they seemingly don't need the racial element at all to make this point.
7400720	7401920	Or do they?
7402560	7406480	In a section titled How Ethnic Differences Fit Into the Story,
7406480	7407920	they write the following.
7407920	7411920	In part one, we described the formation of a cognitive elite.
7411920	7415040	Given the cognitive differences among ethnic and racial groups,
7415040	7418560	the cognitive elite cannot represent all groups equally,
7418560	7421920	a statement with implications that we will develop in part four.
7422640	7427040	Part four being the section of the book comprised of their policy proposals,
7427040	7431040	and it is these policy proposals that are the second part of the reason
7431040	7434080	for the bell curve being such a controversial book.
7434080	7438000	More than either of these things individually being controversial,
7438000	7441920	it's how they interact that really produces the controversy.
7441920	7446000	You see, for all Herrnstein and Murray's posturing about how brave they're being,
7446000	7448640	speaking out and breaking taboos and all that,
7448640	7452240	it is not actually controversial in the scientific community
7452240	7455920	to simply acknowledge group differences in IQ.
7455920	7458000	Let's imagine that instead of the bell curve,
7458000	7462080	Herrnstein and Murray had simply published a list of IQ test results
7462080	7464960	showing differences in IQ in different countries.
7465600	7467280	Nobody would have cared.
7467280	7469600	Researchers from across the political spectrum
7469600	7472560	work with intelligence test data all the time.
7472560	7474640	Some environment-minded researchers,
7474640	7477840	because they acknowledge that the group differences exist,
7477840	7480720	but they want to prove that environmental factors
7480720	7482560	are the key to understanding them.
7482560	7486720	Nor is it controversial to assert that differences in cognitive ability
7486720	7489680	in general are partially due to genetics.
7489680	7495040	There are a whole host of genetic conditions that can affect someone's cognitive ability.
7495040	7498160	Right-wingers who characterize lefties as die-hard,
7498160	7501520	100% environmentalists miss the point here,
7501520	7504400	as we'd actually be hasty to point out the ableism
7504400	7507360	in denying the effects of those genetic conditions.
7507840	7511920	So it's not simply that Herrnstein and Murray are breaking the supposed taboo
7511920	7515840	of discussing IQ differences that sparked the backlash.
7515840	7521200	It's that they explicitly link those differences to a set of policy proposals.
7521200	7526400	This is why the bell curve is controversial, because of its political ideas.
7526400	7527840	So let's talk about those.
7528560	7530880	First off, the enormous glaring problem
7530880	7534560	with the vast majority of Herrnstein and Murray's policy proposals
7534560	7537680	is that they absolutely do not logically follow
7537680	7540640	from any of their previous claims in the bell curve.
7540640	7545200	And if it sounds like I'm exaggerating there, trust me, I am not.
7545200	7548640	Take, for instance, their account of programs like Head Start
7548640	7551280	that are designed to help disadvantaged kids.
7551840	7554480	Herrnstein and Murray acknowledge that these programs
7554480	7556960	can have temporary positive effects,
7556960	7560480	but they argue that these positive effects fade over time
7560480	7565280	and become statistically insignificant by the time those children leave school.
7565280	7567600	This is taken by Herrnstein and Murray as proof
7567600	7571200	that there is ultimately nothing to be done to help these kids.
7571200	7574800	Any temporary positive effects will simply fade away
7574800	7577200	due to their inferior genetics.
7577200	7579440	So we should stop wasting money on them
7579440	7582800	and instead give it to the naturally gifted children.
7582800	7584800	This does not follow, however.
7584800	7587760	There is an alternative interpretation of this situation,
7587760	7589360	which is perfectly consistent
7589360	7593440	with a majority environmental understanding of childhood development.
7594160	7597120	We can argue that these programs produce a positive effect
7597120	7600320	because they are changing the children's environment.
7600320	7603520	Any diminished effects after the programs stop
7603520	7606080	are because the programs stopped,
7606080	7609360	thus changing the environment back to the norm.
7609360	7611520	So instead of abandoning these programs,
7611520	7613040	we should instead take them as proof
7613040	7616880	that environmental changes can produce positive effects
7616880	7620480	and then expand them, increase their funding,
7620480	7624080	have equivalent programs for every stage of school life.
7624080	7628240	Any later diminished effects are proof that we aren't trying hard enough,
7628240	7631280	not that what we're trying to do is impossible.
7631280	7633920	Nearly every policy proposal in the bell curve
7633920	7637200	has this sort of alternative explanation.
7637200	7641760	One of their proposals for dissuading low IQ mothers from having children
7641760	7645040	is to stop the welfare programs that support them.
7645040	7648720	But as we know, richer people tend to have fewer children,
7648720	7653120	and birth rates are lower in countries with comprehensive welfare programs.
7653760	7657680	Making these women poorer will not make them have fewer children.
7657680	7660160	And besides, Hernstein and Murray are arguing
7660160	7663120	that these women are resolutely unintelligent.
7663120	7664320	So if that were true,
7664320	7667520	why would we be expecting them to be able to plan ahead
7667520	7671360	and reason logically that having fewer children is a good idea?
7671360	7674320	That they're not supposed to be able to plan well for the future
7674320	7676000	is kind of the whole point, right?
7676560	7678480	What Hernstein and Murray could have done here
7678480	7683120	is some very basic comparisons between the United States and other countries.
7683120	7686640	They scaremonger about the possible effects of welfare programs
7686640	7689760	which exist in Europe in abundance, for instance.
7689760	7692160	But since those European welfare programs
7692160	7694720	have not led to the sort of utter catastrophe
7694720	7696720	that Hernstein and Murray prophesize,
7696720	7700400	they instead choose to focus only on the United States.
7700400	7702880	Even if Hernstein and Murray had proven
7702880	7706320	that some groups were genetically less intelligent than others,
7706320	7709040	cutting welfare would not follow from that.
7709040	7713360	Rather, one could make the argument that those groups would deserve more welfare
7713360	7717440	because they would have an unfair disadvantage in school and in work
7717440	7719440	that would not be their fault.
7719440	7723520	And even worse than Hernstein and Murray's logic simply not following,
7723520	7729600	their proposals sometimes actually directly contradict with their previous analysis.
7729600	7732800	For example, let's talk about affirmative action.
7732800	7737520	As mentioned earlier, Hernstein and Murray really don't like affirmative action.
7737520	7740000	And as we've also seen, they are very worried
7740000	7743920	about the supposed cognitive stratification of society.
7743920	7746320	And let's briefly quote them talking about that.
7746320	7749440	In this penultimate chapter, we speculate about the impact
7749440	7753120	of cognitive stratification on American life and government.
7753120	7755920	Predicting the course of society is chancy,
7755920	7759280	but certain tendencies seem strong enough to worry about.
7759280	7762160	An increasingly isolated cognitive elite,
7762160	7764960	a merging of the cognitive elite with the affluent,
7764960	7767680	a deteriorating quality of life for people
7767680	7770960	at the bottom end of the cognitive ability distribution.
7770960	7775760	Unchecked, these trends will lead the US towards something resembling a caste society
7775760	7778560	with the underclass mired ever more firmly at the bottom
7778560	7781840	and the cognitive elite ever more firmly anchored at the top,
7781840	7783920	restructuring the rules of society
7783920	7787040	so that it becomes harder and harder for them to lose.
7787680	7789760	Among the other casualties of this process
7789760	7793360	would be American civil society as we have known it.
7793360	7798720	Like other apocalyptic visions, this one is pessimistic, perhaps too much so.
7798720	7801680	On the other hand, there is much to be pessimistic about.
7802240	7804960	Now what Hernstein and Murray fail to spot here
7804960	7807920	is that a policy of aggressive affirmative action
7807920	7811360	would directly work to check the cognitive partitioning
7811360	7813760	that they call frightening and apocalyptic.
7814320	7816480	If Harvard or some other fancy school
7816480	7819680	decided they were gonna admit a certain percentage of applicants
7819680	7823360	based upon some characteristic other than test scores,
7823360	7826800	then there would be that same number of applicants with higher test scores
7826800	7829040	who would therefore not get into Harvard
7829040	7831920	and have to go to their next choice of college.
7831920	7835200	And the next smartest people who would have gone to that college
7835200	7838240	will now not get in and have to go to their next choice
7838240	7840080	and so on down the line.
7840080	7842560	And if this ruthless affirmative action policy
7842640	7845280	was adopted by the group of colleges as a whole,
7845280	7847680	the cognitive elite would be forced to spread out
7847680	7849520	throughout the whole college pool,
7849520	7853920	which would have the added effect of spreading them out geographically too.
7853920	7856640	Hernstein and Murray really should have spotted this,
7856640	7859040	since earlier in the book they talk fondly
7859040	7862240	about Harvard's policy of admitting legacy applicants,
7862240	7866080	those usually being people whose fathers had graduated from Harvard.
7866640	7869520	They also mention applicants being considered for things like
7869520	7873840	his potential as a quarterback or stroke for the eight-man shell
7873840	7876640	and other non-academic qualities.
7876640	7879920	Curiously, Hernstein and Murray do not criticize
7879920	7884080	Harvard's practice of admitting people for non-academic reasons.
7884080	7886560	When it comes to affirmative action, however,
7886560	7890640	Hernstein and Murray are very clear about that being unfair,
7890640	7891520	and I quote,
7891520	7894000	"...to what extent is a society fair
7894000	7896400	when people of similar ability and background
7896400	7898800	are treated as differently as they are now?"
7898800	7902640	In 1964, the answer would have been unambiguous.
7902640	7905680	Such a society is manifestly unfair.
7905680	7908560	The logic was right then, and right now.
7908560	7912080	So colleges admitting applicants for non-academic reasons,
7912080	7915120	such as their father having gone there, that's okay.
7915120	7919760	It's counteracting the dreaded cognitive partitioning of society, after all.
7919760	7923200	But colleges admitting applicants because of affirmative action,
7923200	7925440	well that is, rather dramatically,
7925440	7928320	leaking a poison into the American soul.
7928880	7931680	So how do we account for this apparent contradiction
7931680	7933920	on behalf of Hernstein and Murray?
7933920	7937360	Well, what would you imagine to be the most likely difference
7937360	7942480	between a legacy Harvard applicant and an affirmative action applicant?
7943120	7946000	I will leave it to you to ponder that one.
7946000	7950320	Instead of the unfair and poisonous racial affirmative action,
7950320	7954960	Hernstein and Murray argue instead for a race-blind version of affirmative action
7954960	7958480	based, bizarrely, on test scores.
7958480	7962720	And I say bizarrely here because this idea would actually accelerate
7962720	7966160	the supposedly apocalyptic cognitive partitioning.
7966960	7969040	They say that in the case of two candidates
7969040	7971040	who are fairly closely matched otherwise,
7971040	7975520	universities should give the nod to the applicant from the disadvantaged background.
7975520	7978160	Now, I agree with this in isolation here.
7978160	7980880	I do think that if you have two similar candidates,
7980880	7983120	you should admit the less privileged one.
7983120	7987600	But with regards to Hernstein and Murray's fears of cognitive partitioning, though,
7987600	7990320	this is exactly what they were worried about.
7990320	7995120	College is becoming better at collecting all of society's high IQ people together
7995120	7999520	and funneling them into high IQ jobs in high IQ areas.
7999520	8000720	They've basically said,
8000720	8005680	here's an apocalyptic problem and now here's how to make it happen faster.
8006240	8009360	And actually, regarding the concept of affirmative action,
8009360	8011840	their logic is all wrong there.
8011840	8016320	At the start of the chapter titled Affirmative Action in Higher Education,
8016320	8021200	Hernstein and Murray recount an affirmative action controversy from 1991
8021200	8024320	where a law student at Georgetown University, quote,
8024320	8027040	surreptitiously compiled the entrance statistics
8027040	8029840	for a sample of applicants to Georgetown's law school
8029840	8034400	and then published the results of his research in the law school student newspaper.
8034400	8037920	He revealed that the mean on the law school aptitude test
8037920	8042720	differed by a large margin for accepted black and white students.
8042720	8044720	Hernstein and Murray dubbed this difference
8044720	8048640	the ethnic premium or edge that minority applicants
8048640	8052080	are supposedly being afforded in the admissions process
8052080	8055440	and go on to detail how they've looked at the college admissions data
8055440	8061360	from 26 colleges and found that in the classes entering those in 1991 and 92,
8061360	8064080	the average SAT scores of the black students
8064080	8067760	were below the average SAT scores of the white students.
8067760	8069760	Hernstein and Murray take this as proof
8069760	8074080	that black students have an unfair edge in the college admissions process.
8074080	8078720	Quote, the summary statement about affirmative action in undergraduate institutions
8078720	8081680	is that being either a black or a Latino
8081680	8084240	is worth a great deal in the admissions process
8084240	8088080	at every undergraduate school for which we have data.
8088080	8092720	However, this method of measuring the supposed results of affirmative action
8092720	8094720	is entirely incorrect.
8094720	8097680	There is a crucial flaw in the logic here
8097680	8101600	and it begins with Hernstein and Murray's decision to begin their analysis
8101600	8105840	by looking at the college entrance data instead of earlier
8105840	8109600	by thinking about the wider pool of college applicants.
8109600	8114160	So black people have historically had lower SAT scores than white people.
8114160	8119360	Now whether you believe this is due to some fixed genetically originated lower IQ
8119360	8122960	or you're sensible and you believe it's down to environmental reasons,
8122960	8124240	it is the case.
8124240	8128960	So in any random group of students applying to a college in the United States,
8128960	8133040	we would expect the scores of the black students to be on average
8133040	8135600	lower than the white students if you follow.
8135600	8139520	So what happens next is the college takes a look at this group of applicants
8139520	8143840	and decides to omit some of them using certain criteria.
8143840	8146640	So test scores but usually various other things
8146640	8149840	like extracurricular activities and whatever else.
8149840	8152320	So all the accepted students get in
8152320	8156320	and all the denied students go off to apply somewhere else, right?
8156320	8158720	Then Hernstein and Murray come along to the college
8158720	8161440	and they notice that the scores of the black students
8161440	8163680	are on average below the white students
8163680	8168080	and thus start decrying the terrible unfairness of affirmative action.
8168080	8170640	But what they've missed here is that this discrepancy
8170640	8173920	between the average black and white scores would still exist
8173920	8179040	even if the college admissions process only considered test scores and nothing else.
8179040	8180640	And let's think about this.
8180640	8183920	Imagine an American college in 1991
8183920	8186560	with a certain amount of positions to fill
8186560	8191040	and they get a larger group of students applying for those positions, right?
8191040	8194160	So they have to let some in and not others.
8194160	8197760	In that group of applicants there will be a range of test scores
8197760	8202720	and the black applicants will have on average lower scores than the white applicants.
8202720	8206240	And let's say this college only admits people via test scores
8206240	8209200	so if they have 1,000 positions to fill
8209200	8214800	they only accept the top 1,000 SAT scores and they send everyone else packing.
8214800	8218240	Now in this group of 1,000 successful applicants
8218240	8220960	there will still be both black and white people
8220960	8224400	but of those black people who scored high enough to get in
8224400	8228480	they will be on average towards the lower end of the range.
8228480	8232640	Meaning the black group average will still be lower than the white group average
8232640	8236000	even though they all scored high enough to get in.
8236000	8238320	Even in a world without affirmative action
8238320	8241600	and even with a totally racially blind admissions policy
8241600	8245680	and accepting Hearnstein and Murray's positions regarding racial IQ scores
8245680	8251520	a disparity between black and white SAT scores in college intake groups would still exist.
8251520	8255600	The only way we could fairly expect the two averages to be the same
8255600	8259680	is if the black and white students in that 1991 applicant pool
8259680	8262800	also had on average the same scores.
8262800	8266640	And since Hearnstein and Murray have just spent a huge section of their book
8266640	8269760	arguing for black people's lower cognitive ability
8269760	8272400	I don't know why they'd be expecting that.
8272400	8275920	Moving on from affirmative action I'd like to ask a question.
8276560	8281040	Can the politics of the bell curve be described as eugenics?
8281040	8282960	And I mean yes, right?
8282960	8286800	They're arguing for policies with the agenda of changing birth rates
8286800	8288800	for particular groups of people.
8288800	8292320	They want lower IQ mothers to have fewer children.
8292320	8296800	Hearnstein and Murray stop short of openly embracing eugenics however.
8296800	8301360	They pull a rhetorical trick by saying they're simply worried about dysgenics.
8301360	8304080	Dysgenics being the opposite of eugenics there.
8304080	8309120	So we're not necessarily for it but we are anti the opposite of it.
8309120	8310240	You know, it's very clever.
8310240	8316320	One telling quote here is when Hearnstein and Murray talking about the Nazis say the following
8316320	8320560	followed by the terrors of Nazism and its perversion of eugenics
8320560	8324000	that effectively wiped the idea from public discourse in the West.
8324640	8329760	Now the phrase perversion of eugenics should set off some alarm bells there
8329760	8333120	implying apparently that there is a good sort of eugenics
8333120	8337520	and the Nazis just did it wrong or took it too far or something.
8337520	8342240	Or maybe there was just something uniquely evil about Nazi eugenics
8342240	8345920	that wasn't present in the supposedly good eugenics.
8345920	8346800	Is that true?
8347440	8349280	Well, let's find out.
8349280	8353440	The footage you're seeing here is from a movie called Herb Crank.
8353440	8356000	In English, the Hereditary Defective.
8356560	8362400	This is a 1936 propaganda film produced by the Nazi party's racial policy office.
8362400	8365600	It features video shots at German psychiatric hospitals
8365600	8368320	of people with various types of disabilities
8368320	8371840	interspersed with text informing the audience, among other things,
8371840	8374640	of the expense of caring for these people.
8374640	8380480	Going on to argue that the prevention of hereditarily sick offspring is a moral duty.
8380480	8383840	Now I'm not actually showing the images of the people in the video here
8383840	8386800	as they almost certainly did not consent to be in a film
8386800	8390480	which was used to propagandize in favor of their sterilization
8390480	8393920	and I would feel uncomfortable including that footage in my video.
8394480	8398720	Herb Crank is available online though if you prefer to watch it unedited.
8398720	8400240	The film ends with the quote,
8400240	8405120	the farmer who prevents the overgrowth of the weed promotes the valuable.
8405760	8409120	The purpose of this film was obviously to increase public support
8409120	8412880	for the involuntary sterilization of people with disabilities,
8412880	8417600	a Nazi program that would escalate into outright mass murder just a few years later.
8417600	8420480	Adolf Hitler was reportedly a fan of Herb Crank
8420480	8422960	and encouraged the production of a sequel titled
8422960	8426960	Victims of the Past, The Sin Against Blood and Race
8426960	8431040	which was shown in cinemas throughout Nazi Germany in 1937.
8431760	8434320	So why am I talking about Herb Crank here?
8434320	8437840	Is this simply a slippery slope argument perhaps?
8437840	8442160	Look where all this eugenics rubbish leads to the Nazis and the Holocaust.
8443120	8446240	Now although I think that would be a fair point to make actually,
8446880	8452160	no this particular movie has a much more direct link to what we're talking about today.
8452160	8454160	Now something that might come as a shock to you
8454160	8457840	and it certainly did to me in the process of researching this video
8457840	8462640	is the extent of the international eugenics movement prior to World War II.
8463280	8466640	Nazi eugenicists were not operating in a bubble
8466640	8470400	and most importantly for us here is that they had a reciprocal relationship
8470400	8472080	with American eugenicists.
8472080	8476240	You see Herb Crank had another big fan in addition to Hitler.
8476800	8481040	So this guy is Harry H. Loughlin, an American eugenicist,
8481040	8483520	director of the Eugenics Record Office
8483520	8487680	and founding member of the American Eugenics Society.
8487680	8490240	He likes eugenics if you didn't pick up on that.
8490240	8494080	Now in 1922 Harry Loughlin published a book titled
8494080	8496960	Eugenical Sterilization in the United States
8496960	8501840	which included a chapter titled Model Eugenical Sterilization Law.
8501840	8503360	This model law begins
8503360	8509600	an act to prevent the procreation of persons socially inadequate from defective inheritance
8509600	8513440	by authorizing and providing for the eugenical sterilization
8513440	8518400	of certain potential parents carrying degenerate hereditary qualities.
8518400	8521520	This law designates a socially inadequate person
8521520	8526400	as someone who fails chronically in comparison with normal persons
8526400	8528560	to maintain himself or herself
8528560	8532560	as a useful member of the organized social life of the state.
8532560	8536000	These socially inadequate people were not just the ill
8536000	8541200	but also for example the criminalistic, the inebriate and the dependent
8541200	8547360	including orphans, ne'er-do-wells, the homeless, tramps and paupers.
8547360	8550800	18 US states passed laws based upon Loughlin's model
8550800	8554320	and between them sterilized tens of thousands of people.
8554320	8560560	And in 1933 somewhere else passed a law which was based upon Loughlin's model.
8560560	8564480	The law for the prevention of hereditarily diseased offspring
8564480	8568320	which actually was slightly more moderate than what the model law proposed
8568320	8569600	if you can believe it.
8569600	8572320	This was of course Nazi Germany.
8572320	8576960	Loughlin was later awarded an honorary degree by the University of Heidelberg
8576960	8579120	for his work on behalf of the quote,
8579120	8581360	science of racial cleansing.
8581360	8584640	Loughlin was also an open Nazi party supporter
8584640	8588080	writing enthusiastically about Nazi Germany's eugenics laws
8588080	8591200	in a publication titled Eugenic News.
8591760	8594080	And why shouldn't he be excited about them?
8594080	8595680	I mean, he wrote them.
8595680	8598960	In addition to inspiring Nazi party policy
8598960	8602560	Loughlin also helped to disseminate their propaganda.
8602640	8607040	In 1936 he purchased an English translation of Erbcrank
8607040	8610880	and raised funds to have it shown in American high schools,
8610880	8612080	which it was.
8612080	8614880	That's right, just a couple of years before the Nazis
8614880	8618480	started systematically murdering people with disabilities
8618480	8622560	this Nazi eugenics movie was actually shown in American schools
8622560	8626480	and this event was reported on favorably in the Nazi press.
8626480	8629120	Loughlin raised the funds to distribute the film
8629120	8631600	by writing to Wycliffe Draper
8631600	8634560	who was another American eugenicist and racist
8634560	8637760	and importantly for Loughlin, a millionaire.
8637760	8642880	Together in 1937 Loughlin and Draper founded the Pioneer Fund
8642880	8647520	the purpose of which was to promote the genetic stock of people quote,
8647520	8651440	deemed to be descended predominantly from white persons
8651440	8656640	who settled in the original 13 states prior to the adoption of the constitution.
8656640	8660720	Now besides subjecting school children to Nazi propaganda
8660720	8664560	the Pioneer Fund set about supporting massive air quotes
8664560	8667360	research into race betterment
8667360	8673040	giving enormous grants to any researcher willing to push a pro-eugenics agenda
8673040	8677680	and here, dear video watchers, is where we rejoin the bell curve.
8677680	8681600	Richard Lin, you remember, the guy who thinks the single best study
8681600	8686160	of the quote, negroid intelligence was carried out under apartheid.
8686160	8690720	He's received over $600,000 from the Pioneer Fund
8690720	8696320	and currently, as in now, currently today, is the head of the Pioneer Fund
8696320	8699440	because it is still going and he is still alive.
8699440	8703040	Mankind Quarterly, the journal which published Lin's work
8703040	8706880	that is cited in the bell curve, is funded by the Pioneer Fund.
8707520	8711120	Mankind Quarterly includes among its founders Henry Garrett
8711120	8715120	an American psychologist who testified in favor of segregated schools
8715120	8717520	during Brown versus Board of Education
8717520	8722400	Corrado Gini, who was president of the Italian Genetics and Eugenics Society
8722400	8723920	in Fascist Italy
8723920	8726400	and Othmar Freiherr von Verschuer
8726400	8730000	who was director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology
8730000	8732880	Human Heredity and Eugenics in Nazi Germany
8732880	8735280	was a member of the Nazi Party
8735280	8739920	and, believe it or not, the mentor of Joseph Mengele.
8739920	8744560	Joseph Mengele, of course, being the physician at the Auschwitz concentration camp
8744560	8748960	infamous for performing human experimentation on the prisoners.
8748960	8753840	During World War II, Mengele provided Verschuer with human remains from Auschwitz
8753840	8756720	to use in his research into eugenics.
8756720	8759920	That is who founded Mankind Quarterly.
8759920	8765200	Editor of The New Republic, Charles Lane, writing about the bell curve in 1994
8765200	8769440	noted that five articles from the journal, that's Mankind Quarterly,
8769440	8772240	are actually cited in the bell curve's bibliography
8772240	8777040	but the influence on the book from scholars linked to Mankind Quarterly is more significant.
8777040	8781280	No fewer than 17 researchers cited in the bibliography of the bell curve
8781280	8783680	have contributed to Mankind Quarterly.
8783680	8789280	Ten are present or former editors or members of its editorial advisory board.
8789280	8794640	J. Philippe Rushton, the guy wandering around asking people how far they can ejaculate
8794640	8798880	he was president of the Pioneer Fund from 2002 to 2012
8798880	8801760	received hundreds of thousands of dollars from it
8801760	8805840	and he used Pioneer Funds to mail 40,000 copies of his book
8805840	8809600	Race, Evolution and Behavior to various social scientists.
8809600	8814240	Another Pioneer Fund recipient was American anthropologist Donald Swan.
8814240	8819120	Now in 1966, Donald Swan was arrested on charges of mail fraud.
8819120	8821600	When the police investigated Swan's apartment
8821600	8825840	they found an assortment of illegal weapons, a stash of racist literature,
8825840	8828960	Nazi memorabilia including flags and a helmet
8828960	8832880	and photographs of Swan with members of the American Nazi Party.
8833680	8834560	Oops.
8834560	8838240	Do you remember Linda Gottfriedsen, the author of the public statement
8838240	8840720	defending the bell curve's claims about intelligence
8840720	8843680	that I mentioned way back at the start of the video?
8843680	8850800	Well as of 1994, she'd received $267,000 from the Pioneer Fund.
8850800	8853120	And speaking of that public statement actually,
8853120	8858080	the Southern Poverty Law Center notes that more than 20 of the 52 signatories
8858080	8860640	were themselves Pioneer Fund recipients.
8860640	8866240	And crucially for us here, the Pioneer Fund wanted to fund Richard Herrnstein.
8866240	8871360	The head of the fund prior to J. Philippe Rushton was a lawyer called Harry F. Weyer
8871360	8874720	and in 1994, the year that the bell curve came out,
8874720	8878320	he told a journalist interviewing him that regarding Herrnstein
8878320	8882640	we'd have funded him at the drop of a hat but he never asked.
8882640	8885680	Now the fact that the bell curve includes among its sources
8885680	8888640	a bunch of people who receive money from the Nazi Fund
8888640	8891040	and publish papers in the Nazi journal
8891040	8894960	was understandably cause for concern for many when it was published
8894960	8898720	and this was used frequently to dismiss the book's arguments.
8898720	8902400	So Murray includes a very short defense of the Pioneer Fund
8902400	8905920	in his afterword to the bell curve which reads as follows.
8905920	8910080	The relationship between the founder of the Pioneer Fund and today's Pioneer Fund
8910080	8914240	is roughly analogous to that between Henry Ford and today's Ford Foundation.
8914240	8918720	So he's saying, you know, it may have been founded by pro-Nazi eugenicists
8918720	8920640	but today it's completely different.
8921200	8925840	The trouble is, Murray includes absolutely no evidence to back this statement up.
8925840	8927760	He treats it as a given.
8927760	8933760	But actually, the Pioneer Fund has been unwavering in its support for eugenics over the years.
8933760	8936000	Richard Lynn, the current head of the fund,
8936000	8940640	works with the explicitly white supremacist publication American Renaissance
8940640	8942480	and speaks at their conferences.
8942480	8946640	The white supremacist editor of American Renaissance, Jared Taylor,
8946640	8951440	who viewers of my other videos will remember, is funded by the Pioneer Fund.
8951440	8955440	So I don't buy Charles Murray just saying it has changed.
8955440	8958480	He doesn't give evidence for why he thinks that
8958480	8961120	and there is ample evidence against it.
8961120	8966000	Anyway, it's about time to wrap this video up with a few final thoughts, I think.
8966000	8970560	But let's first briefly summarize our main counter-arguments to the bell curve.
8970560	8974320	Firstly, the bell curve does not prove that genetics are the primary reason
8974320	8976000	for differences in intelligence.
8976000	8980720	The authors are not geneticists, they're a psychologist and a social scientist.
8980720	8985680	Their estimates of the importance of genes are based on suppositions and guesses.
8986400	8989840	After failing to make the case that IQ is genetic in origin,
8989840	8993600	they compare that IQ not to one's social background,
8993600	8995840	as the back cover of the book promises,
8995840	9000880	but a much more narrowly defined index of parental socioeconomic status,
9000880	9004400	which includes only a few of the relevant variables.
9004400	9009120	The main source of their data is more a test of academic achievement than intelligence
9009120	9013200	and since it did not return a normal bell curve distribution,
9013200	9015600	Hernstein and Murray manipulated the data
9015600	9019520	to exaggerate what were previously much smaller differences.
9019520	9024480	After a completely unnecessary section making the case for racial IQ differences,
9024480	9026880	they include a set of policy proposals,
9026880	9030800	most of which do not follow logically from their previous analysis
9030800	9033040	and some of which contradict it.
9033040	9037360	And of course, Hernstein and Murray's willingness to quote highly questionable data
9037360	9041520	from even more questionable sources should be very worrisome,
9041520	9044640	even if you happen to agree with them otherwise.
9044640	9048080	Having now read a lot of criticism of the bell curve,
9048080	9053840	I think I've identified a particular difficulty that people have in arguing against it.
9053840	9059120	And it's a tendency to argue with not the opinions that Hernstein and Murray claim to hold,
9059120	9062000	but the opinions that they would have to hold
9062000	9065360	in order to support the policy proposals which they do.
9065360	9068720	For example, it makes no sense to claim that IQ
9068720	9072080	explains only a tiny amount of the variance between people
9072080	9075120	and that you cannot know what someone will do from their IQ,
9075120	9076880	as Hernstein and Murray do,
9076880	9079840	and then move on to claim that IQ is one of the best ways
9079840	9083120	of determining an employee's individual productivity
9083120	9086960	and employers should pick applicants with the highest IQs.
9086960	9091360	A passing critic of the bell curve who hears this latter claim might then respond,
9091360	9092720	but that makes no sense.
9092720	9096400	IQ explains only a tiny amount of the variance between people.
9096400	9099440	You can't know what someone will do from their IQ.
9099440	9101920	To which defenders of the bell curve respond,
9101920	9105760	aha, you didn't read the book because they say that in there.
9106320	9109840	Now this gotcha tactic, as satisfying as it might be,
9109920	9113520	does not actually explain the contradiction, however.
9113520	9116960	This is the main rhetorical trick of the bell curve.
9116960	9121200	They pretend to concede to mainstream scientific opinion,
9121200	9126240	but then propose a set of conservative and eugenicist political policies
9126240	9127600	as if they hadn't.
9128160	9132320	Anyone who genuinely believed all the moderate hedging quotes
9132320	9134800	that Hernstein and Murray put in the bell curve
9134800	9138000	would not be able to propose the policies that they do.
9138560	9141440	So the critics of the bell curve see these policies
9141440	9143680	and start arguing against the opinions
9143680	9147920	that they assume Hernstein and Murray would therefore have to hold.
9147920	9150320	Thus the repeated defense of the bell curve
9150320	9154080	is that the authors can't be racist or biased or bigoted,
9154080	9155520	as their critics claim,
9155520	9159200	because in their book they say that they're not.
9159200	9162000	The critics must therefore have not read the book.
9162640	9165840	This is not the airtight defense they think it is.
9165840	9168640	We care about their political proposals,
9168640	9171200	not how moderate they pretended to be
9171200	9175520	in order to camouflage their approach to those political proposals.
9175520	9178240	One could, if one wanted, go through my video
9178240	9180640	and find corresponding quotes in the bell curve
9180640	9183040	for pretty much all of my counterarguments.
9183680	9187360	See, they also worry about the dangers of social engineering.
9187360	9191280	They also paraphrase Lewontin's thought experiment with the plants.
9191280	9194720	They also talk about the various problems with IQ testing.
9194720	9198000	They also call the existence of G arguable.
9198000	9200160	They say all this in the book,
9200160	9201840	so therefore they've addressed it
9201840	9205360	and your counterarguments are nullified, right?
9205360	9208240	The problem is, putting all that in the book
9208240	9212800	didn't stop them from advocating for the political policies that they do,
9212800	9213840	and it should have.
9214400	9217600	If, with regards to how much genes influence intelligence,
9217600	9219840	you spend a whole book saying things like
9219840	9223360	the state of knowledge does not permit a precise estimate,
9223440	9225920	but then you go on to propose a set of policies
9225920	9231120	that only make sense if intelligence is definitely primarily genetic in origin,
9231120	9233200	you are contradicting yourself.
9233200	9235680	You don't actually care that the state of knowledge
9235680	9237600	does not permit a precise estimate.
9237600	9241280	That apparently isn't going to stop you from acting as if it does.
9241280	9245120	I'm guilty myself of several times arguing against the point
9245120	9247680	that Herrnstein and Murray should have made
9247680	9250000	instead of the one that they did make.
9250000	9251440	Only a minute ago I said
9251440	9253600	the bell curve does not prove that genetics
9253600	9256240	are the primary reason for differences in intelligence,
9256240	9257920	to which the offense is, of course,
9257920	9259920	that they never set out to do such a thing.
9260480	9261840	But they should have.
9261840	9263120	If you don't prove that,
9263120	9265680	then the rest of the argument doesn't work.
9265680	9268560	Now, they couldn't have proved that if they wanted to, of course,
9268560	9270880	because the data is inconclusive.
9270880	9273920	Herrnstein and Murray acknowledged the data is inconclusive,
9273920	9275600	but then just keep on trucking,
9275600	9280000	assuming firstly that later genetics research will prove them correct,
9280000	9280960	which it hasn't.
9281040	9284400	The data is still inconclusive 25 years later.
9284400	9288320	And secondly, assuming that any data which trends against their position
9288320	9291200	is due to strictly temporary effects.
9291200	9293680	Rising IQ scores are thus explained away
9293680	9297440	as being due to an increase in test-taking ability or elsewhere,
9297440	9300320	as due to the data being distorted by the baby boom.
9300880	9304560	Rising standards of living can raise a country's average IQ,
9304560	9307120	but only to a point, it is assumed.
9307120	9309760	Black and white IQ scores are converging,
9309760	9312240	but they may be expected to stop,
9312240	9315280	and the gap could even begin to widen again.
9315280	9319520	So predicting the future on this issue is little more than guesswork at this point.
9319520	9322720	All the trends that contradict what the authors of the bell curve
9322720	9326960	would quite clearly like to be true are assumed to be time-limited.
9326960	9329520	You get the sense that Herrnstein and Murray are implying
9329520	9332000	that once we get to the end of history,
9332000	9336880	once things stop happening to make the data look like we're wrong,
9336880	9337920	then you'll see.
9337920	9339200	You'll all see.
9339200	9343680	In just a few more years, you'll see that we were right all along.
9343680	9346400	Of course, to a reader in 2019,
9346400	9348720	all this, as with much of the rest of the book,
9348720	9350880	comes off as rather quaint.
9350880	9353520	A relic of the 90s, maybe.
9353520	9354560	Like pogs.
9355120	9358320	You see, today, of course, we have social media
9358320	9361680	and daily get to see just how cognitively elite
9361680	9364080	the supposed cognitive elite are.
9364640	9367920	Herrnstein and Murray's theory of intellectual inequality
9367920	9372400	is, of course, just economic inequality with the license plates changed.
9372400	9374640	And I can think of no better illustration of this
9374640	9378480	than the college admissions bribery scandal from earlier this year.
9378480	9382480	This was a criminal conspiracy organized by William Rick Singer
9382480	9385760	to doctor exam results and bribe college officials
9385760	9388480	in order to ensure children of rich parents
9388480	9390720	get into several top universities.
9391520	9395440	Singer testified that he'd helped more than 750 families
9395440	9397440	get children into college this way,
9397520	9401120	and he furthermore claimed that some of the tactics he used to inflate test scores
9401120	9404880	were widespread outside of his particular scheme.
9404880	9409280	The problem, of course, is not that the rich are getting smarter,
9409280	9411520	it's that the rich are getting richer
9411520	9414960	and can increasingly rig the system to their own benefit.
9414960	9418720	The fact that the rich definitely aren't cognitively elite
9418720	9422960	is increasingly becoming a problem, thanks to our imbalanced economies.
9422960	9427040	In 2008, this cognitive elite caused an economic crash
9427040	9430960	and had to be bailed out by all the middle bell curve average people.
9430960	9435440	Lastly here, I'd like to say that the bell curve proves, if anything,
9435440	9438720	that any apprehension the scientific community might have
9438720	9442800	about discussing possible differences in racial cognitive ability
9442800	9445200	would be very well justified.
9445200	9447440	Because what you shouldn't want to happen,
9447440	9451120	as a scientist presenting inconclusive evidence for such,
9451120	9454080	is for someone hearing that inconclusive evidence
9454080	9456880	to then start using it as a justification
9456880	9460080	to propose eugenicist political policies.
9460080	9463200	The bell curve is all this in one package.
9463200	9467040	Inconclusive evidence and eugenicist politics.
9467040	9470480	The bell curve has stuck around not because it breaks new ground
9470480	9471920	or presents new ideas,
9471920	9475760	but because it is a useful pseudo-scientific justification
9475760	9479040	for conservatives looking to cut welfare programs
9479040	9483200	and racists looking to feel justified in their racism.
9483200	9486640	It is a scabrous piece of racial pornography.
9489120	9490560	Thanks for watching, folks.
9492480	9494800	This one took a bit of time to put together.
9494800	9496320	I'm sure you've noticed.
9496320	9498720	26,000 words, this is.
9499280	9502080	Thank you, as always, to my patrons for supporting me
9502080	9505760	so that I can keep making ridiculous videos like this one.
9506320	9508880	If you'd like to join this list of lovely people,
9508880	9511520	I will put a link in the video description below
9511520	9513760	that you can check out if you like.
9513760	9516960	And I'd like to give an extra thank you to my patrons this time
9516960	9520480	for fact-checking a previous draft of this video for me
9520480	9523120	and making some very useful suggestions.
9523120	9525600	This video would not be half as good as it is
9525600	9527680	without all of your excellent feedback,
9527680	9529520	so I am very grateful for that.
9530480	9533040	I'd also like to thank the people who were able to source
9533040	9535920	a few difficult-to-find studies for me.
9535920	9539440	Some folks were even kind enough to physically go and photograph
9539440	9541760	or scan things that were not available online,
9541760	9545040	so thank you so much for helping me out there.
9545040	9548400	Thank you also to the editors who helped me out with this video.
9548400	9551760	Your contributions and suggestions were fantastic.
9551760	9553440	Now, with any project of this length,
9553440	9557120	you inevitably end up with a lot of unused material at the end,
9557120	9559600	and there is so much that I left out here,
9559600	9561280	usually for time reasons,
9561280	9563760	because it would just take too long to explain,
9563760	9566800	or because it was too complicated and beyond my ability
9566800	9569520	to present the information in a way that made sense.
9570080	9573600	If you'd like to look into the various subjects mentioned today
9573600	9575760	in more depth than I do in the video,
9575760	9579360	I would recommend checking out the sources and reading list below.
9580000	9582320	Righty-ho, that's all from me today, folks.
9582320	9583920	I'll see you next time.
