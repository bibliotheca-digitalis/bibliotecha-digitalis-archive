00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
Hello, everyone. This is a video about YouTuber Thunderf00t, and specifically his latest video about Anita Sarkeesian,

00:08.320 --> 00:14.240
entitled, Anita Sarkeesian Banned Sexy Girls in Video Games.

00:14.240 --> 00:21.480
But first off, I wanna briefly look at a video he put out a few weeks ago called, somewhat obnoxiously,

00:21.480 --> 00:28.240
I Don't Debate Enemies, I Bury Them, in which he's talking about ideas for future videos.

00:28.240 --> 00:29.680
Let's take a listen.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.320
Turns out, Anita Sarkeesian's again going with the, with the trope versus women in video games.

00:38.320 --> 00:46.480
And... the whole thing is basically one giant cherry pick.

00:46.480 --> 00:54.800
That's right, Anita Sarkeesian is at it once again, talking about sexism in video games.

00:54.960 --> 01:01.760
How irrational of her to keep banging on that same drum over and over.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.320
You'd really think she'd have something else to talk about by now, wouldn't you?

01:06.320 --> 01:09.760
Now, before we move on, I just wanna point out two things here.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.840
First off is Thunderf00t's use of the word cherry pick.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.360
Apparently, he's not a fan of cherry picking.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.520
Just file that away in your short-term memory for a little while.

01:21.520 --> 01:27.920
Secondly, if we look at one of the top-rated comments on that video, Ted Cruz...

01:27.920 --> 01:30.160
Ted Cruz, wow, says,

01:30.160 --> 01:39.360
"'I don't care what you do, as long as it's not Anita. I'm fucking tired of her. Stick to science, 227 likes.'"

01:39.360 --> 01:43.280
You see, Thunderf00t's got something of a thing for Anita,

01:43.280 --> 01:49.840
and he doesn't seem to be able to shut up about her... at all. Ever.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.920
And sure enough, against the emphatic objections of his audience,

01:53.920 --> 01:58.640
he decided to make another video about Anita, and we're gonna talk about it.

01:58.640 --> 02:03.120
So, first things first, it can be a little hard to follow Thunderf00t's point at times.

02:03.120 --> 02:10.240
His video appears to be about 75% constructed out of older videos he's made about Anita Sarkeesian,

02:10.240 --> 02:15.520
and as a result, he can tend to wander a little bit, or a lot, away from the point,

02:15.520 --> 02:19.040
and he doesn't really stick to a clear argumentative thread.

02:19.040 --> 02:24.000
So, I've had to do a lot of untangling of his arguments over the course of making this video,

02:24.000 --> 02:29.280
and so, to avoid accusations of hypocrisy here, I'd recommend you go and watch his video.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.200
I'll put a link in the description.

02:31.200 --> 02:36.240
I'd encourage everyone to watch Anita's video and Thunderf00t's response,

02:36.240 --> 02:40.960
and that way, you can be sure that I'm not misrepresenting his arguments.

02:40.960 --> 02:47.280
Secondly, this is a video about how Thunderf00t misrepresents Anita's opinions and misleads his audience.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.320
I'm not going to be talking about Anita Sarkeesian or the arguments in her videos

02:52.320 --> 02:58.000
beyond explaining where Thunderf00t has misunderstood or misrepresented them.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.920
I agree with some of Anita's points, and I disagree with others, but this video isn't about her,

03:03.920 --> 03:06.800
so I'm not going to be going into any of that right now.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.800
And with the disclaimers out of the way, let's get started.

03:10.800 --> 03:16.560
So, Thunderf00t opens this video with Anita talking about Overwatch, and let's take a look.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.040
The five female characters introduced consisted of the Slender Adventurer Tracer,

03:21.040 --> 03:25.040
the Slender Healer Mercy, the Slender Support Character Symmetra,

03:25.040 --> 03:30.800
the Slender Sniper Widowmaker, and the Slender but well-armored Security Chief Pharah.

03:30.800 --> 03:35.040
Overwatch was hardly alone in having all of its female characters share a similar physique.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.240
Well, I ain't that the truth, because in 20...

03:38.240 --> 03:42.480
Now, massive Blizzard fanboy that I am, I noticed something here.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.960
Watching Thunderf00t's clips of Anita,

03:44.960 --> 03:49.280
she appears to be cherry-picking her examples from the Overwatch cast.

03:49.280 --> 03:54.880
She seems to only be talking about certain characters in the game, and ignoring the other characters.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.480
And I'm not the only one to notice this apparent oversight.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.880
User Duaneef says,

04:00.880 --> 04:04.480
What about Mei, Zarya, and Ana?

04:04.480 --> 04:06.400
MoppyPuppy says,

04:06.400 --> 04:11.680
Did Anita just skip over Mei and Zarya and expect no one to notice?

04:11.680 --> 04:13.680
Zed7Games says,

04:13.680 --> 04:17.520
I've don't seen the video, but she did miss Zarya?

04:17.520 --> 04:22.320
I mean, that character invalidates her entire argument 100%.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.320
User Charles Darwin...

04:24.320 --> 04:26.000
Charles Darwin? Wow.

04:26.000 --> 04:26.800
...says,

04:26.800 --> 04:32.560
Doesn't Overwatch also have a female character named Mei who isn't exactly Slender?

04:32.560 --> 04:37.040
But then again, facts never really mattered to Sarkeesian.

04:37.040 --> 04:43.520
And there's a couple of hundred other people who all commented, echoing similar points.

04:43.520 --> 04:48.320
For non-Overwatch players out there, there are three female characters in the game

04:48.320 --> 04:52.400
that aren't the typical young and slender type that Anita's talking about.

04:52.400 --> 04:56.240
There's Zarya, who is a large, muscled Russian weightlifter.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.640
There's Ana, who's an older Egyptian sniper lady.

05:00.640 --> 05:05.680
And there's Mei, who is lovely and amazing, and she's my friend.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.920
So, what's going on here?

05:07.920 --> 05:11.760
Is Anita really trying to get away with only mentioning the characters

05:11.760 --> 05:15.200
that support her arguments, and not the characters that don't?

05:15.920 --> 05:19.280
You know, why didn't Anita talk about these three characters?

05:19.280 --> 05:20.480
Oh, but what's this?

05:21.040 --> 05:22.960
He says, feigning shock.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.000
She did mention those three characters.

05:26.640 --> 05:31.600
Which means all the people scrolling past right now didn't watch Anita's video.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.320
So let's do better than those guys, and actually watch Anita's video.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.120
And here's the first time she mentions Overwatch.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.280
At their annual BlizzCon event in 2014,

05:41.280 --> 05:43.920
the wildly successful game studio Blizzard Entertainment

05:43.920 --> 05:46.800
showed off a new game they had in the works called Overwatch.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.560
And from that first reveal it was clear,

05:48.560 --> 05:51.760
the appeal of Overwatch resided in its cast of characters.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.520
A diverse assortment of heroes, each with unique traits and abilities.

05:55.520 --> 05:59.680
You see, Anita is specifically talking about the 2014

05:59.680 --> 06:02.000
Overwatch character announcement trailer,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.120
which did not feature Zarya, Ana, or Mei.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.560
And in which Bastion got a shield in front of him when he was in turret form,

06:08.560 --> 06:12.960
which is frankly ridiculous and imbalanced, and I'm glad they ditched that.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.560
And later on in Anita's video, when she's giving examples of games

06:16.560 --> 06:21.760
which do feature women with different body types, she returns to Overwatch.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.760
Let's go back to Overwatch for a moment.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.360
Since that initial reveal, a few female heroes have been added to the roster.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.960
There's Mei and Zarya, both of whom have body types that are notably different

06:30.960 --> 06:33.360
from those of the originally announced female characters.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.640
Ana, reporting for duty.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.760
And more recently, Blizzard announced the game's next hero, Ana,

06:39.760 --> 06:42.400
who's both an older woman and a woman of color.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.960
And she goes on to call these character designs welcome and encouraging.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.160
Of course, Thunderf00t neglected to show any of that in his video.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.400
He edited out Anita's introduction of the trailer and neglected to mention it.

06:54.400 --> 06:58.720
And he didn't show her talking positively about the other characters in the game.

06:58.720 --> 07:04.160
And he therefore left his fans with an incorrect impression of Anita's arguments.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.840
He actually cherry-picked in such a manner that led his fans to believe

07:07.840 --> 07:12.960
Anita was the one cherry-picking, which is a neat trick, so well done in that regard.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.280
After Overwatch, Anita moves on to talk about the character rosters of some other games.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.000
And there's one particularly shameless example

07:22.000 --> 07:25.840
of Thunderf00t taking what Anita says out of context here.

07:25.840 --> 07:30.800
Let's first watch Anita's clip, and then we'll see what Thunderf00t does to it.

07:30.800 --> 07:35.200
Similarly, when we look at the champions on offer in the hugely popular MOBA League of Legends,

07:35.200 --> 07:38.720
we see the designers employing a wonderful range of body shapes and proportions

07:38.720 --> 07:40.640
across dozens of male characters.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.280
From the classic muscular warrior physique of Taric,

07:43.280 --> 07:45.120
to the hefty beer belly of Gragas,

07:45.120 --> 07:48.240
to the cartoonishly disproportionate body of Dr. Mundo,

07:48.240 --> 07:52.800
there isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type,

07:52.800 --> 07:56.640
and the value of these characters is definitely not connected to their sexual desirability.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.120
But when we look at the female heroes,

07:59.120 --> 08:02.560
there's nothing approaching the diversity we see on the male side of the roster.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.800
And here's Thunderf00t's take on that bit.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.400
While female heroes are mostly relegated to being standard humanoid characters

08:08.400 --> 08:10.720
with conventionally attractive facial features,

08:10.720 --> 08:14.960
female characters across the board are often limited to that same specific body type.

08:14.960 --> 08:19.600
"-There isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.160
There isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type.

08:24.160 --> 08:28.820
There isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type.

08:28.820 --> 08:31.280
Really, Anita? Yeah, sure about that."

08:31.280 --> 08:36.240
You see, Anita was specifically talking about the lineup of League of Legends there.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.880
Thunderf00t just lifted one line out of it,

08:38.880 --> 08:44.240
and repeated it over and over, pretending that Anita was talking about all video games.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.480
But she wasn't. Was she, Thunderf00t?

08:48.480 --> 08:54.640
And the other audio clip is from when Anita is talking specifically about the lineup of Dota 2.

08:54.640 --> 08:59.600
"-Likewise, in Dota 2, male heroes can be handsome or comical, outlandish or grotesque,

08:59.600 --> 09:03.200
while female heroes are mostly relegated to being standard humanoid characters

09:03.200 --> 09:05.760
with conventionally attractive facial features."

09:05.760 --> 09:10.880
Thunderf00t took two out-of-context audio clips and stitched them together

09:10.880 --> 09:15.120
to make it appear that Anita is arguing something that she isn't.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.080
But even if we take Thunderf00t's point seriously here,

09:18.080 --> 09:20.880
just look at some of the examples he's used to illustrate

09:20.880 --> 09:24.080
that all men have a default body type in video games.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.160
Firstly, Kratos, the god of war.

09:28.720 --> 09:35.200
Secondly, Michael from GTA V, who is a middle-aged, slightly fat man.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.840
So apparently, they're- they're the same thing.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.960
They're the same thing in Thunderf00t's head.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.680
So let's talk about another game that Thunderf00t misleads his audience over,

09:45.680 --> 09:48.320
and that's the excellent Beyond Good and Evil.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.440
"-Slender- Slender- Slender- Slender- Slender- Adventurer- Slender figure

09:51.440 --> 09:55.040
with prominent breasts is viewed as the standard for female character design."

09:55.040 --> 09:59.840
"-But oddly, that standard for female character design didn't stop feminist frequency

09:59.840 --> 10:05.520
from recommending Jade from Beyond Good and Evil as a positive feminist character."

10:05.520 --> 10:08.960
So I'll pause old Thunderf00t there just to point something out.

10:08.960 --> 10:14.000
Um, in her video, Anita never said that Slender characters in games were sexist.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.480
She never even said that having Slender characters in games was harmful.

10:18.480 --> 10:22.400
Watch the following clip and see if you can't follow along with her argument.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.080
"-Rather than seeing such an exciting range of female characters,

10:26.080 --> 10:28.960
we mostly get the same body type over and over again.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.800
One designed to be sexually appealing to the presumed straight male player.

10:32.800 --> 10:37.760
This reliance on the same body type for so many female characters isn't just boring, it's harmful."

10:37.760 --> 10:39.920
Now, which of the following did she say?

10:40.560 --> 10:42.720
Slender characters in games are harmful?

10:43.360 --> 10:48.640
Or, an over-reliance on one specific body type in games is harmful?

10:48.640 --> 10:52.080
Now, some people seem to really struggle with this point, so I'll give you a hint.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.920
Those two sentences do not say the same thing.

10:55.920 --> 11:01.920
"-No one who was a slender, normatively beautiful, cut-price Lara Croft here.

11:01.920 --> 11:07.760
You know, the one with the skin-tight pink top hugging Jade's normatively beautiful body

11:07.760 --> 11:11.440
and revealing that fantastic pancake-flat midriff."

11:11.440 --> 11:14.320
Now, if you watch Anita's video about Beyond Good and Evil,

11:14.320 --> 11:19.760
she does actually address Jade's appearance, and she even calls Jade's top silly.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.800
Thunderfunk neglected to include that in his video, obviously.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.880
But for the most part, Anita is much more interested

11:26.880 --> 11:30.720
in the presentation of Jade's character than her appearance.

11:30.720 --> 11:36.640
She likes that Jade has everyday motivations, she's presented as smart and capable and all that.

11:36.640 --> 11:41.920
You see, Thunderfunk, appearance isn't everything when it comes to character design.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.960
And speaking of Jade's everyday motivations, here's what Thunderfunk has to say about that.

11:46.960 --> 11:52.080
"-And of course, she had realistic concerns that normal people could relate to."

11:52.080 --> 11:54.960
"-We definitely need more games with warm, compassionate,

11:54.960 --> 11:59.120
multi-talented characters who have realistic and relatable concerns."

11:59.120 --> 12:02.240
"-Like stopping a giant alien invasion."

12:02.240 --> 12:07.920
Now, actually, Jade's relatable concerns that Anita's talking about in that section of her video

12:07.920 --> 12:12.240
are paying the bills and taking care of her adopted family.

12:12.240 --> 12:17.680
You see, if you watch a whole video and don't just cherry-pick lines out of it, this is obvious.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.760
"-Games often give us heroes who are either fantastically wealthy,

12:21.760 --> 12:24.480
like the Bruce Waynes and Lara Crofts of the world,

12:24.480 --> 12:27.760
or who at least don't have practical everyday concerns about money.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.040
But money's not just an abstract concept for Jade,

12:31.040 --> 12:34.000
she's a working-class character with real financial struggles.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.240
This is established at the very beginning of the game when we learn that the orphanage's

12:38.240 --> 12:42.720
electricity has been shut off and Uncle Page's hovercraft is in dire need of repair."

12:43.360 --> 12:46.560
And Thunderfunk has a bit more to say about Beyond Good and Evil.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.520
"-Got damseled twice in one game."

12:50.080 --> 12:54.480
"-But you are not like them. You are mine, Johnny.

12:54.480 --> 12:58.080
And I am going to kill the human part of you."

13:05.440 --> 13:10.320
"-Because while a damsel in distress reinforces long-standing regressive myths about women as a group..."

13:10.320 --> 13:18.960
"-Come home."

13:18.960 --> 13:21.760
So what he's done here is notice a few things.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.720
Firstly, Anita likes Jade.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.680
Secondly, Anita doesn't like damsels in distress.

13:29.680 --> 13:34.160
And thirdly, Jade is helped out by a male character.

13:34.160 --> 13:39.120
And then steam starts coming out of his ears and his head spins around like a cartoon robot

13:39.120 --> 13:40.640
trying to divide by zero.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.720
But here's what he missed.

13:42.720 --> 13:49.760
"-Free yourself, Jade! I'll create a diversion!"

13:57.440 --> 14:01.840
It may seem like a minor detail, but the fact that Page tells Jade to free herself

14:01.840 --> 14:04.880
instead of doing it for her is incredibly important.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.760
He assists her, but he doesn't rescue her.

14:07.760 --> 14:11.120
He knows that even in this situation, she's far from helpless.

14:11.120 --> 14:16.000
And the fact that Page treats her as a capable partner encourages us to see her that way too.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.160
You see, Anita actually likes this take on the damsel thing.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.720
She didn't ignore it or overlook it.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.120
She thinks this is the way to do it right.

14:25.680 --> 14:30.160
She even included Beyond Good and Evil as a positive example of a male character

14:30.160 --> 14:34.560
helping a female character way back in her damsels in distress videos.

14:35.520 --> 14:39.520
"-Now, I'm certainly not arguing that all stories must include completely fearless,

14:39.520 --> 14:43.760
hyper-individualistic, heroic women who pull themselves up by their bootstraps

14:43.760 --> 14:45.440
and never need anything from anyone.

14:46.080 --> 14:50.240
Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with offering or occasionally needing assistance."

14:53.040 --> 14:56.800
Of course, Thunderf00t neglected to mention any of that in his video.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.880
And actually, he went a little further than just not mentioning it this time.

15:00.960 --> 15:05.280
And this is me thinking like a video editor again here, but indulge me.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.800
So Thunderf00t's making his video, and he wants to include the scene

15:08.800 --> 15:14.240
where Jade is imprisoned by the alien thing so he can make his damsel in distress comparison.

15:14.240 --> 15:18.880
And now, we know he has Anita's video on Beyond Good and Evil in his video editor

15:18.880 --> 15:23.760
because he uses clips from it, which means he's already got the scene right there.

15:23.760 --> 15:29.840
So why not take the easy path and just use this footage of the scene to illustrate his point?

15:29.840 --> 15:34.480
Now, the problem for Thunderf00t here is the feminist frequency border on the video.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.120
You see, having this border would tip his audience off

15:37.120 --> 15:40.720
to the fact that Anita does actually talk about this scene.

15:40.720 --> 15:46.720
So instead of using that footage, he has to go out and specifically download the cutscene by itself.

15:46.720 --> 15:51.760
And this gives his audience the impression that Anita doesn't address that part of the game.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.920
Is that intentional or unintentional?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.680
Who knows.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.960
Now, the next cherry pick of Thunderf00t's that I want to talk about

15:58.960 --> 16:02.480
has to do with Anita's appearance at the unhelpfully named

16:03.120 --> 16:05.680
The Conference in Sweden last year.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.400
And let's watch the start of his argument.

16:25.840 --> 16:32.560
So first things first, all of the games that Anita has ever found problematic have an adult rating.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.480
All of them? Well, that's what he said.

16:36.480 --> 16:41.760
So either Thunderf00t is just exaggerating in order to mislead his audience,

16:41.760 --> 16:45.360
or he thinks Super Princess Peach has an M rating.

16:45.920 --> 16:49.920
You see, Anita talks about problematic things in all kinds of games,

16:49.920 --> 16:52.160
not just ones with a mature rating.

16:52.160 --> 16:57.680
And talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you automatically have to hate it.

16:58.320 --> 17:02.640
I mean, a lot of Anita's videos even start out with that exact disclaimer.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.680
Now let's watch the next part of Thunderf00t's argument.

17:15.680 --> 17:28.080
And here's where the cherry pick comes in.

17:28.080 --> 17:33.520
If you watch Anita's full talk at the The Conference, stupid name,

17:33.520 --> 17:38.000
you'll see that in this section, Anita is talking specifically about attitudes

17:38.000 --> 17:42.160
towards casual gamers and what are considered casual games.

17:45.680 --> 17:59.120
The image she puts up are all games of a specific type,

17:59.120 --> 18:03.760
because they're the kinds of games she's talking about in that part of her speech.

18:03.760 --> 18:08.480
She didn't just come out and apropos of nothing show a slide of some games and say,

18:08.560 --> 18:10.800
These are my favorite video games.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.040
You know, it's got a context.

18:13.040 --> 18:17.840
She's talking about patronizing attitudes towards casual gamers.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.200
That's why she has an image of some casual games.

18:21.200 --> 18:25.280
And speaking of patronizing, let's watch Thunderf00t prove her point for her.

18:38.480 --> 18:51.920
Now, the next part of Thunderf00t's video I want to talk about

18:51.920 --> 18:54.480
strays into some weird territory.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.440
Let's give it a watch.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.400
Well, Anita, allow me to tell you.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.160
It's to make her look good.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.960
And before you launch into a diatribe about how all those

19:06.960 --> 19:11.360
gender signifies to mean all women and reduce them to mere sex objects,

19:11.360 --> 19:16.480
you know, because it's not like you in real life would ever use appearance enhancing cosmetics,

19:16.480 --> 19:23.200
you know, like like bright red lipstick to imply arousal or eye makeup to draw people's attention

19:23.200 --> 19:28.960
to your eyes or midriff bearing outfits, high heels to add height and hip sway for the

19:29.440 --> 19:30.640
evil male gaze.

19:30.640 --> 19:35.760
And of course, why not a low cut figure hugging top to draw your

19:35.760 --> 19:40.720
presumably straight male audience's attention to that part of your body.

19:40.720 --> 19:46.400
So first off here, Thunderf00t, Philip, what the fuck, man?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.600
Are you doing okay?

19:47.600 --> 19:50.720
Like in general, is everything all right over there, dude?

19:50.720 --> 19:54.080
Because that's some weird shit you just did right there.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.680
Secondly, let's look at this argument here.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.000
You know, if we can find it.

20:00.800 --> 20:06.640
So I think he's saying that because Anita criticizes video game women

20:07.360 --> 20:13.280
who are presented like this, she shouldn't dress like this.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.560
So let's unravel this thing.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.680
The video where Anita talks about this character is called

20:19.680 --> 20:24.400
Lingerie is Not Armor, and it's about inappropriate clothing in games.

20:25.040 --> 20:29.680
Now the character in question is some sort of special forces operative or something

20:29.680 --> 20:35.040
from a Resident Evil game, but she dresses inappropriately for the job.

20:35.040 --> 20:35.840
That's the point.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.200
It's not that she's trying to look good.

20:39.200 --> 20:43.680
It's that she's trying to look good while fighting off a zombie invasion

20:43.680 --> 20:44.800
or whatever it is she does.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.360
Her clothes don't fit her role.

20:47.920 --> 20:51.280
None of this is to say that characters in games should never be sexual.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.320
Far from it.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.520
Sexuality and sexualization are very different things.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.840
The sexualization of female characters is about designing them, dressing them,

20:59.840 --> 21:02.560
or framing them in ways that are specifically intended

21:02.560 --> 21:06.160
to be sexually appealing to presumed male viewers or players.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.440
Anita's not saying women shouldn't ever try to look good.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.680
The argument's about appropriate clothing for a situation.

21:13.680 --> 21:18.080
And one example of a time when it is appropriate to dress up and try and look nice

21:18.080 --> 21:20.240
is a fancy launch event for your new thing.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.000
Whatever the thing was.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.080
Additionally, Thunderf-

21:25.280 --> 21:26.800
What's a midriff?

21:26.800 --> 21:30.080
Eye makeup to draw people's attention to your eyes.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.080
Or midriff-bearing outfits.

21:32.080 --> 21:32.960
A midriff?

21:33.520 --> 21:34.320
Well, that's okay.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.560
Maybe you just misspoke that one time.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.320
And revealing that fantastic pancake-flat midriff.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.120
Oh, right.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.720
He thinks it's called a midriff.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.360
Okay, Phil, I'm gonna do you a favor now.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.200
You see this part of the body here?

21:47.760 --> 21:48.880
That's a midriff.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.520
There's no such thing as a midriff.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.520
And Thunderf- isn't done talking about this launch event.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.960
Why is he even looking up photographs of Anita Sarkeesian?

21:58.960 --> 22:03.600
And when I say white male, I mean white male.

22:03.600 --> 22:08.800
This is the premiere of Anita Sarkeesian's new video series about ordinary women.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.080
I've got a game for you.

22:10.080 --> 22:15.440
It's called spot the woman or minority in his social justice warrior hipster crowd.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.320
And if your cherry-pick detector isn't going off by now, I'd get it looked at.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.800
You see, I went and looked up all the other photographs of this event.

22:24.800 --> 22:30.160
And so, as crass and stupid as this is, and with my full apologies,

22:30.800 --> 22:35.920
let's play spot the minority with your host, Thunderf00t.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.920
And when I say white male, I mean white male.

22:40.560 --> 22:45.760
This is the premiere of Anita Sarkeesian's new video series about ordinary women.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.040
I've got a game for you.

22:47.040 --> 22:52.400
It's called spot the woman or minority in his social justice warrior hipster crowd.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.840
So, the last instance of cherry picking I want to talk about

22:55.840 --> 22:59.760
is the clip that Thunderf00t chooses to close his video out on.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.240
And he really did save the best for last.

23:02.240 --> 23:06.160
Rather than taking you as the archetypal straw feminist

23:06.160 --> 23:09.200
that you complained about all those many years ago.

23:09.200 --> 23:13.520
You know, the one who finds every slight little thing sexist.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.480
The girls are influenced by Femme Fatale's malicious rhetoric

23:16.480 --> 23:20.880
to see benign, routine, everyday things as a conspiracy against women,

23:20.880 --> 23:22.080
and against them personally.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.440
Everything is sexist, everything is racist,

23:25.440 --> 23:28.720
everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.

23:29.680 --> 23:32.000
Well, that seems fairly damning, doesn't it?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.560
Straight from the horse's mouth, as they say.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.800
Everything's racist and sexist.

23:37.520 --> 23:40.320
Every little thing, that's what she said.

23:41.040 --> 23:45.040
But I don't know, something about that clip seemed a little off to me

23:45.040 --> 23:47.440
and my cherry pick detector was going off again,

23:47.440 --> 23:53.120
so I decided to go and look up the circumstances in which Anita said this statement.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.120
Which is harder than it seems, you know.

23:55.120 --> 23:59.280
Unlike old Thunderf00t there, I don't have a folder on my desktop

23:59.280 --> 24:04.320
filled with videos of Anita Sarkeesian and photographs of Anita Sarkeesian

24:04.320 --> 24:06.640
and articles written by Anita Sarkeesian,

24:07.440 --> 24:10.240
secret love letters to Anita Sarkeesian, and so on,

24:10.240 --> 24:12.320
so I just had to go googling for it.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.880
And I found it. It's from All About Women 2015,

24:16.880 --> 24:21.680
the How To Be A Feminist panel, at around 33 minutes in.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.520
And before we watch the full clip,

24:23.520 --> 24:27.280
let's just once again see how Thunderf00t chose to present it.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.240
The girls are influenced by Femme Fatale's malicious rhetoric

24:30.320 --> 24:34.640
to see benign, routine, everyday things as a conspiracy against women

24:34.640 --> 24:35.920
and against them personally.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.280
Everything is sexist, everything is racist,

24:39.280 --> 24:42.480
everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.120
And now here's the actual clip.

24:46.240 --> 24:50.800
I'm intrigued by Anita, I'll come back to you, I'm intrigued by Anita saying

24:50.800 --> 24:52.880
she had to learn about systems,

24:53.440 --> 24:57.840
you had to learn about the sociology of systems and structural change,

24:57.840 --> 25:00.720
and it was obviously quite a journey for you.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.000
Yeah, absolutely.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.120
I sort of joke about how it was the most liberating thing

25:05.120 --> 25:06.080
that ever happened to me,

25:06.080 --> 25:08.480
and also the most frustrating for everyone around me.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.640
Because when you start learning about systems,

25:11.360 --> 25:15.120
everything is sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic,

25:15.120 --> 25:19.440
and you have to point it all out to everyone all the time.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.800
So there's a good year of my life.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.640
There's a good year of my life where it was just,

25:24.640 --> 25:26.560
I was the most obnoxious person to be around.

25:27.280 --> 25:30.800
And there's not really much I need to say about that, I don't think.

25:31.760 --> 25:36.720
So some closing thoughts on Thunderf00t's weird obsession with Anita Sarkeesian.

25:37.360 --> 25:41.920
You'd really think that after so much practice arguing against Anita,

25:41.920 --> 25:44.480
Thunderf00t would be better at it.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.840
If Anita's arguments were so easily refuted,

25:47.840 --> 25:51.440
Thunderf00t wouldn't have to resort to twisting her words,

25:51.440 --> 25:53.360
showing out-of-context clips,

25:53.920 --> 25:57.760
only showing half of her arguments and not the conclusion,

25:57.760 --> 25:59.760
cherry-picking photographs,

25:59.760 --> 26:03.120
and making weird comparisons to Anita's own appearance.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.360
Thunderf00t, stop embarrassing yourself, man.

26:08.080 --> 26:08.640
Give it up.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.360
Your fans don't even want to watch this.

26:12.080 --> 26:12.640
Stick to...

26:14.320 --> 26:16.400
whatever else it is you do.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.480
I- I don't know what you do.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.880
Dicking about with thermal cameras or something.
