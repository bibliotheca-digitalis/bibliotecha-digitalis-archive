00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Hello, everyone. This is a video about YouTuber Thunderf00t, and specifically his latest video about Anita Sarkeesian,

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,240
entitled, Anita Sarkeesian Banned Sexy Girls in Video Games.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,480
But first off, I wanna briefly look at a video he put out a few weeks ago called, somewhat obnoxiously,

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,240
I Don't Debate Enemies, I Bury Them, in which he's talking about ideas for future videos.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,680
Let's take a listen.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,320
Turns out, Anita Sarkeesian's again going with the, with the trope versus women in video games.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,480
And... the whole thing is basically one giant cherry pick.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,800
That's right, Anita Sarkeesian is at it once again, talking about sexism in video games.

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,760
How irrational of her to keep banging on that same drum over and over.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,320
You'd really think she'd have something else to talk about by now, wouldn't you?

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,760
Now, before we move on, I just wanna point out two things here.

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
First off is Thunderf00t's use of the word cherry pick.

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,360
Apparently, he's not a fan of cherry picking.

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,520
Just file that away in your short-term memory for a little while.

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,920
Secondly, if we look at one of the top-rated comments on that video, Ted Cruz...

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,160
Ted Cruz, wow, says,

17
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:39,360
"'I don't care what you do, as long as it's not Anita. I'm fucking tired of her. Stick to science, 227 likes.'"

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,280
You see, Thunderf00t's got something of a thing for Anita,

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,840
and he doesn't seem to be able to shut up about her... at all. Ever.

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,920
And sure enough, against the emphatic objections of his audience,

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,640
he decided to make another video about Anita, and we're gonna talk about it.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,120
So, first things first, it can be a little hard to follow Thunderf00t's point at times.

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:10,240
His video appears to be about 75% constructed out of older videos he's made about Anita Sarkeesian,

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,520
and as a result, he can tend to wander a little bit, or a lot, away from the point,

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,040
and he doesn't really stick to a clear argumentative thread.

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,000
So, I've had to do a lot of untangling of his arguments over the course of making this video,

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,280
and so, to avoid accusations of hypocrisy here, I'd recommend you go and watch his video.

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
I'll put a link in the description.

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,240
I'd encourage everyone to watch Anita's video and Thunderf00t's response,

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,960
and that way, you can be sure that I'm not misrepresenting his arguments.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:47,280
Secondly, this is a video about how Thunderf00t misrepresents Anita's opinions and misleads his audience.

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm not going to be talking about Anita Sarkeesian or the arguments in her videos

33
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,000
beyond explaining where Thunderf00t has misunderstood or misrepresented them.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,920
I agree with some of Anita's points, and I disagree with others, but this video isn't about her,

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,800
so I'm not going to be going into any of that right now.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
And with the disclaimers out of the way, let's get started.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,560
So, Thunderf00t opens this video with Anita talking about Overwatch, and let's take a look.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,040
The five female characters introduced consisted of the Slender Adventurer Tracer,

39
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
the Slender Healer Mercy, the Slender Support Character Symmetra,

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,800
the Slender Sniper Widowmaker, and the Slender but well-armored Security Chief Pharah.

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,040
Overwatch was hardly alone in having all of its female characters share a similar physique.

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,240
Well, I ain't that the truth, because in 20...

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,480
Now, massive Blizzard fanboy that I am, I noticed something here.

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,960
Watching Thunderf00t's clips of Anita,

45
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,280
she appears to be cherry-picking her examples from the Overwatch cast.

46
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,880
She seems to only be talking about certain characters in the game, and ignoring the other characters.

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,480
And I'm not the only one to notice this apparent oversight.

48
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,880
User Duaneef says,

49
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,480
What about Mei, Zarya, and Ana?

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
MoppyPuppy says,

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Did Anita just skip over Mei and Zarya and expect no one to notice?

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Zed7Games says,

53
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,520
I've don't seen the video, but she did miss Zarya?

54
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,320
I mean, that character invalidates her entire argument 100%.

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
User Charles Darwin...

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
Charles Darwin? Wow.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
...says,

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,560
Doesn't Overwatch also have a female character named Mei who isn't exactly Slender?

59
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,040
But then again, facts never really mattered to Sarkeesian.

60
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,520
And there's a couple of hundred other people who all commented, echoing similar points.

61
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,320
For non-Overwatch players out there, there are three female characters in the game

62
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
that aren't the typical young and slender type that Anita's talking about.

63
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,240
There's Zarya, who is a large, muscled Russian weightlifter.

64
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,640
There's Ana, who's an older Egyptian sniper lady.

65
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,680
And there's Mei, who is lovely and amazing, and she's my friend.

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,920
So, what's going on here?

67
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Is Anita really trying to get away with only mentioning the characters

68
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,200
that support her arguments, and not the characters that don't?

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,280
You know, why didn't Anita talk about these three characters?

70
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,480
Oh, but what's this?

71
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,960
He says, feigning shock.

72
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,000
She did mention those three characters.

73
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,600
Which means all the people scrolling past right now didn't watch Anita's video.

74
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,320
So let's do better than those guys, and actually watch Anita's video.

75
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,120
And here's the first time she mentions Overwatch.

76
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,280
At their annual BlizzCon event in 2014,

77
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,920
the wildly successful game studio Blizzard Entertainment

78
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,800
showed off a new game they had in the works called Overwatch.

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
And from that first reveal it was clear,

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,760
the appeal of Overwatch resided in its cast of characters.

81
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,520
A diverse assortment of heroes, each with unique traits and abilities.

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,680
You see, Anita is specifically talking about the 2014

83
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,000
Overwatch character announcement trailer,

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
which did not feature Zarya, Ana, or Mei.

85
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,560
And in which Bastion got a shield in front of him when he was in turret form,

86
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,960
which is frankly ridiculous and imbalanced, and I'm glad they ditched that.

87
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,560
And later on in Anita's video, when she's giving examples of games

88
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,760
which do feature women with different body types, she returns to Overwatch.

89
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Let's go back to Overwatch for a moment.

90
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,360
Since that initial reveal, a few female heroes have been added to the roster.

91
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
There's Mei and Zarya, both of whom have body types that are notably different

92
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,360
from those of the originally announced female characters.

93
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,640
Ana, reporting for duty.

94
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,760
And more recently, Blizzard announced the game's next hero, Ana,

95
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,400
who's both an older woman and a woman of color.

96
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,960
And she goes on to call these character designs welcome and encouraging.

97
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,160
Of course, Thunderf00t neglected to show any of that in his video.

98
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,400
He edited out Anita's introduction of the trailer and neglected to mention it.

99
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,720
And he didn't show her talking positively about the other characters in the game.

100
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,160
And he therefore left his fans with an incorrect impression of Anita's arguments.

101
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,840
He actually cherry-picked in such a manner that led his fans to believe

102
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,960
Anita was the one cherry-picking, which is a neat trick, so well done in that regard.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,280
After Overwatch, Anita moves on to talk about the character rosters of some other games.

104
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,000
And there's one particularly shameless example

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
of Thunderf00t taking what Anita says out of context here.

106
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,800
Let's first watch Anita's clip, and then we'll see what Thunderf00t does to it.

107
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,200
Similarly, when we look at the champions on offer in the hugely popular MOBA League of Legends,

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,720
we see the designers employing a wonderful range of body shapes and proportions

109
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,640
across dozens of male characters.

110
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,280
From the classic muscular warrior physique of Taric,

111
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
to the hefty beer belly of Gragas,

112
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
to the cartoonishly disproportionate body of Dr. Mundo,

113
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,800
there isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type,

114
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,640
and the value of these characters is definitely not connected to their sexual desirability.

115
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
But when we look at the female heroes,

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
there's nothing approaching the diversity we see on the male side of the roster.

117
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
And here's Thunderf00t's take on that bit.

118
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
While female heroes are mostly relegated to being standard humanoid characters

119
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
with conventionally attractive facial features,

120
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,960
female characters across the board are often limited to that same specific body type.

121
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,600
"-There isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type.

122
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,160
There isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type.

123
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,820
There isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type.

124
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,280
Really, Anita? Yeah, sure about that."

125
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,240
You see, Anita was specifically talking about the lineup of League of Legends there.

126
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,880
Thunderf00t just lifted one line out of it,

127
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,240
and repeated it over and over, pretending that Anita was talking about all video games.

128
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,480
But she wasn't. Was she, Thunderf00t?

129
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,640
And the other audio clip is from when Anita is talking specifically about the lineup of Dota 2.

130
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,600
"-Likewise, in Dota 2, male heroes can be handsome or comical, outlandish or grotesque,

131
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
while female heroes are mostly relegated to being standard humanoid characters

132
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,760
with conventionally attractive facial features."

133
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,880
Thunderf00t took two out-of-context audio clips and stitched them together

134
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,120
to make it appear that Anita is arguing something that she isn't.

135
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
But even if we take Thunderf00t's point seriously here,

136
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,880
just look at some of the examples he's used to illustrate

137
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,080
that all men have a default body type in video games.

138
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,160
Firstly, Kratos, the god of war.

139
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,200
Secondly, Michael from GTA V, who is a middle-aged, slightly fat man.

140
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,840
So apparently, they're- they're the same thing.

141
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,960
They're the same thing in Thunderf00t's head.

142
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,680
So let's talk about another game that Thunderf00t misleads his audience over,

143
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,320
and that's the excellent Beyond Good and Evil.

144
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
"-Slender- Slender- Slender- Slender- Slender- Adventurer- Slender figure

145
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,040
with prominent breasts is viewed as the standard for female character design."

146
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,840
"-But oddly, that standard for female character design didn't stop feminist frequency

147
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,520
from recommending Jade from Beyond Good and Evil as a positive feminist character."

148
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,960
So I'll pause old Thunderf00t there just to point something out.

149
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,000
Um, in her video, Anita never said that Slender characters in games were sexist.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,480
She never even said that having Slender characters in games was harmful.

151
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,400
Watch the following clip and see if you can't follow along with her argument.

152
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,080
"-Rather than seeing such an exciting range of female characters,

153
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,960
we mostly get the same body type over and over again.

154
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,800
One designed to be sexually appealing to the presumed straight male player.

155
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,760
This reliance on the same body type for so many female characters isn't just boring, it's harmful."

156
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,920
Now, which of the following did she say?

157
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
Slender characters in games are harmful?

158
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,640
Or, an over-reliance on one specific body type in games is harmful?

159
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,080
Now, some people seem to really struggle with this point, so I'll give you a hint.

160
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,920
Those two sentences do not say the same thing.

161
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,920
"-No one who was a slender, normatively beautiful, cut-price Lara Croft here.

162
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,760
You know, the one with the skin-tight pink top hugging Jade's normatively beautiful body

163
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,440
and revealing that fantastic pancake-flat midriff."

164
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,320
Now, if you watch Anita's video about Beyond Good and Evil,

165
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,760
she does actually address Jade's appearance, and she even calls Jade's top silly.

166
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
Thunderfunk neglected to include that in his video, obviously.

167
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,880
But for the most part, Anita is much more interested

168
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,720
in the presentation of Jade's character than her appearance.

169
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,640
She likes that Jade has everyday motivations, she's presented as smart and capable and all that.

170
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,920
You see, Thunderfunk, appearance isn't everything when it comes to character design.

171
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,960
And speaking of Jade's everyday motivations, here's what Thunderfunk has to say about that.

172
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,080
"-And of course, she had realistic concerns that normal people could relate to."

173
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,960
"-We definitely need more games with warm, compassionate,

174
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,120
multi-talented characters who have realistic and relatable concerns."

175
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,240
"-Like stopping a giant alien invasion."

176
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,920
Now, actually, Jade's relatable concerns that Anita's talking about in that section of her video

177
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,240
are paying the bills and taking care of her adopted family.

178
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,680
You see, if you watch a whole video and don't just cherry-pick lines out of it, this is obvious.

179
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,760
"-Games often give us heroes who are either fantastically wealthy,

180
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,480
like the Bruce Waynes and Lara Crofts of the world,

181
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
or who at least don't have practical everyday concerns about money.

182
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,040
But money's not just an abstract concept for Jade,

183
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,000
she's a working-class character with real financial struggles.

184
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,240
This is established at the very beginning of the game when we learn that the orphanage's

185
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,720
electricity has been shut off and Uncle Page's hovercraft is in dire need of repair."

186
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,560
And Thunderfunk has a bit more to say about Beyond Good and Evil.

187
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,520
"-Got damseled twice in one game."

188
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,480
"-But you are not like them. You are mine, Johnny.

189
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,080
And I am going to kill the human part of you."

190
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,320
"-Because while a damsel in distress reinforces long-standing regressive myths about women as a group..."

191
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:18,960
"-Come home."

192
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,760
So what he's done here is notice a few things.

193
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,720
Firstly, Anita likes Jade.

194
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Secondly, Anita doesn't like damsels in distress.

195
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,160
And thirdly, Jade is helped out by a male character.

196
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,120
And then steam starts coming out of his ears and his head spins around like a cartoon robot

197
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,640
trying to divide by zero.

198
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,720
But here's what he missed.

199
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,760
"-Free yourself, Jade! I'll create a diversion!"

200
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,840
It may seem like a minor detail, but the fact that Page tells Jade to free herself

201
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,880
instead of doing it for her is incredibly important.

202
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,760
He assists her, but he doesn't rescue her.

203
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,120
He knows that even in this situation, she's far from helpless.

204
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,000
And the fact that Page treats her as a capable partner encourages us to see her that way too.

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,160
You see, Anita actually likes this take on the damsel thing.

206
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,720
She didn't ignore it or overlook it.

207
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
She thinks this is the way to do it right.

208
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,160
She even included Beyond Good and Evil as a positive example of a male character

209
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,560
helping a female character way back in her damsels in distress videos.

210
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,520
"-Now, I'm certainly not arguing that all stories must include completely fearless,

211
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,760
hyper-individualistic, heroic women who pull themselves up by their bootstraps

212
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
and never need anything from anyone.

213
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,240
Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with offering or occasionally needing assistance."

214
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,800
Of course, Thunderf00t neglected to mention any of that in his video.

215
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,880
And actually, he went a little further than just not mentioning it this time.

216
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,280
And this is me thinking like a video editor again here, but indulge me.

217
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,800
So Thunderf00t's making his video, and he wants to include the scene

218
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,240
where Jade is imprisoned by the alien thing so he can make his damsel in distress comparison.

219
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,880
And now, we know he has Anita's video on Beyond Good and Evil in his video editor

220
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,760
because he uses clips from it, which means he's already got the scene right there.

221
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,840
So why not take the easy path and just use this footage of the scene to illustrate his point?

222
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,480
Now, the problem for Thunderf00t here is the feminist frequency border on the video.

223
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,120
You see, having this border would tip his audience off

224
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,720
to the fact that Anita does actually talk about this scene.

225
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,720
So instead of using that footage, he has to go out and specifically download the cutscene by itself.

226
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,760
And this gives his audience the impression that Anita doesn't address that part of the game.

227
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,920
Is that intentional or unintentional?

228
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,680
Who knows.

229
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,960
Now, the next cherry pick of Thunderf00t's that I want to talk about

230
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,480
has to do with Anita's appearance at the unhelpfully named

231
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,680
The Conference in Sweden last year.

232
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
And let's watch the start of his argument.

233
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,560
So first things first, all of the games that Anita has ever found problematic have an adult rating.

234
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,480
All of them? Well, that's what he said.

235
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,760
So either Thunderf00t is just exaggerating in order to mislead his audience,

236
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,360
or he thinks Super Princess Peach has an M rating.

237
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,920
You see, Anita talks about problematic things in all kinds of games,

238
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,160
not just ones with a mature rating.

239
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,680
And talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you automatically have to hate it.

240
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,640
I mean, a lot of Anita's videos even start out with that exact disclaimer.

241
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,680
Now let's watch the next part of Thunderf00t's argument.

242
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:28,080
And here's where the cherry pick comes in.

243
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,520
If you watch Anita's full talk at the The Conference, stupid name,

244
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,000
you'll see that in this section, Anita is talking specifically about attitudes

245
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,160
towards casual gamers and what are considered casual games.

246
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:59,120
The image she puts up are all games of a specific type,

247
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,760
because they're the kinds of games she's talking about in that part of her speech.

248
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,480
She didn't just come out and apropos of nothing show a slide of some games and say,

249
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,800
These are my favorite video games.

250
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,040
You know, it's got a context.

251
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,840
She's talking about patronizing attitudes towards casual gamers.

252
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,200
That's why she has an image of some casual games.

253
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,280
And speaking of patronizing, let's watch Thunderf00t prove her point for her.

254
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:51,920
Now, the next part of Thunderf00t's video I want to talk about

255
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,480
strays into some weird territory.

256
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,440
Let's give it a watch.

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
Well, Anita, allow me to tell you.

258
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
It's to make her look good.

259
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,960
And before you launch into a diatribe about how all those

260
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,360
gender signifies to mean all women and reduce them to mere sex objects,

261
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,480
you know, because it's not like you in real life would ever use appearance enhancing cosmetics,

262
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,200
you know, like like bright red lipstick to imply arousal or eye makeup to draw people's attention

263
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,960
to your eyes or midriff bearing outfits, high heels to add height and hip sway for the

264
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,640
evil male gaze.

265
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,760
And of course, why not a low cut figure hugging top to draw your

266
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,720
presumably straight male audience's attention to that part of your body.

267
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,400
So first off here, Thunderf00t, Philip, what the fuck, man?

268
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,600
Are you doing okay?

269
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,720
Like in general, is everything all right over there, dude?

270
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,080
Because that's some weird shit you just did right there.

271
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,680
Secondly, let's look at this argument here.

272
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,000
You know, if we can find it.

273
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,640
So I think he's saying that because Anita criticizes video game women

274
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,280
who are presented like this, she shouldn't dress like this.

275
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,560
So let's unravel this thing.

276
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,680
The video where Anita talks about this character is called

277
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,400
Lingerie is Not Armor, and it's about inappropriate clothing in games.

278
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,680
Now the character in question is some sort of special forces operative or something

279
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,040
from a Resident Evil game, but she dresses inappropriately for the job.

280
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,840
That's the point.

281
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,200
It's not that she's trying to look good.

282
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,680
It's that she's trying to look good while fighting off a zombie invasion

283
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,800
or whatever it is she does.

284
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Her clothes don't fit her role.

285
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,280
None of this is to say that characters in games should never be sexual.

286
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,320
Far from it.

287
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,520
Sexuality and sexualization are very different things.

288
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,840
The sexualization of female characters is about designing them, dressing them,

289
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,560
or framing them in ways that are specifically intended

290
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,160
to be sexually appealing to presumed male viewers or players.

291
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,440
Anita's not saying women shouldn't ever try to look good.

292
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,680
The argument's about appropriate clothing for a situation.

293
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,080
And one example of a time when it is appropriate to dress up and try and look nice

294
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,240
is a fancy launch event for your new thing.

295
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,000
Whatever the thing was.

296
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,080
Additionally, Thunderf-

297
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,800
What's a midriff?

298
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,080
Eye makeup to draw people's attention to your eyes.

299
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Or midriff-bearing outfits.

300
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,960
A midriff?

301
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,320
Well, that's okay.

302
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,560
Maybe you just misspoke that one time.

303
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,320
And revealing that fantastic pancake-flat midriff.

304
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,120
Oh, right.

305
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,720
He thinks it's called a midriff.

306
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,360
Okay, Phil, I'm gonna do you a favor now.

307
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
You see this part of the body here?

308
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,880
That's a midriff.

309
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,520
There's no such thing as a midriff.

310
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,520
And Thunderf- isn't done talking about this launch event.

311
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,960
Why is he even looking up photographs of Anita Sarkeesian?

312
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,600
And when I say white male, I mean white male.

313
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,800
This is the premiere of Anita Sarkeesian's new video series about ordinary women.

314
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,080
I've got a game for you.

315
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,440
It's called spot the woman or minority in his social justice warrior hipster crowd.

316
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,320
And if your cherry-pick detector isn't going off by now, I'd get it looked at.

317
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,800
You see, I went and looked up all the other photographs of this event.

318
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,160
And so, as crass and stupid as this is, and with my full apologies,

319
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,920
let's play spot the minority with your host, Thunderf00t.

320
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,920
And when I say white male, I mean white male.

321
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,760
This is the premiere of Anita Sarkeesian's new video series about ordinary women.

322
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
I've got a game for you.

323
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,400
It's called spot the woman or minority in his social justice warrior hipster crowd.

324
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,840
So, the last instance of cherry picking I want to talk about

325
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,760
is the clip that Thunderf00t chooses to close his video out on.

326
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,240
And he really did save the best for last.

327
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,160
Rather than taking you as the archetypal straw feminist

328
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,200
that you complained about all those many years ago.

329
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,520
You know, the one who finds every slight little thing sexist.

330
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,480
The girls are influenced by Femme Fatale's malicious rhetoric

331
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,880
to see benign, routine, everyday things as a conspiracy against women,

332
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,080
and against them personally.

333
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Everything is sexist, everything is racist,

334
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,720
everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.

335
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,000
Well, that seems fairly damning, doesn't it?

336
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,560
Straight from the horse's mouth, as they say.

337
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,800
Everything's racist and sexist.

338
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,320
Every little thing, that's what she said.

339
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,040
But I don't know, something about that clip seemed a little off to me

340
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,440
and my cherry pick detector was going off again,

341
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,120
so I decided to go and look up the circumstances in which Anita said this statement.

342
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Which is harder than it seems, you know.

343
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,280
Unlike old Thunderf00t there, I don't have a folder on my desktop

344
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,320
filled with videos of Anita Sarkeesian and photographs of Anita Sarkeesian

345
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,640
and articles written by Anita Sarkeesian,

346
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
secret love letters to Anita Sarkeesian, and so on,

347
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,320
so I just had to go googling for it.

348
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,880
And I found it. It's from All About Women 2015,

349
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,680
the How To Be A Feminist panel, at around 33 minutes in.

350
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,520
And before we watch the full clip,

351
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,280
let's just once again see how Thunderf00t chose to present it.

352
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,240
The girls are influenced by Femme Fatale's malicious rhetoric

353
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,640
to see benign, routine, everyday things as a conspiracy against women

354
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,920
and against them personally.

355
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,280
Everything is sexist, everything is racist,

356
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,480
everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.

357
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
And now here's the actual clip.

358
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,800
I'm intrigued by Anita, I'll come back to you, I'm intrigued by Anita saying

359
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,880
she had to learn about systems,

360
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,840
you had to learn about the sociology of systems and structural change,

361
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,720
and it was obviously quite a journey for you.

362
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah, absolutely.

363
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,120
I sort of joke about how it was the most liberating thing

364
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,080
that ever happened to me,

365
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,480
and also the most frustrating for everyone around me.

366
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,640
Because when you start learning about systems,

367
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,120
everything is sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic,

368
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,440
and you have to point it all out to everyone all the time.

369
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,800
So there's a good year of my life.

370
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,640
There's a good year of my life where it was just,

371
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,560
I was the most obnoxious person to be around.

372
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,800
And there's not really much I need to say about that, I don't think.

373
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,720
So some closing thoughts on Thunderf00t's weird obsession with Anita Sarkeesian.

374
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,920
You'd really think that after so much practice arguing against Anita,

375
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,480
Thunderf00t would be better at it.

376
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,840
If Anita's arguments were so easily refuted,

377
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,440
Thunderf00t wouldn't have to resort to twisting her words,

378
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,360
showing out-of-context clips,

379
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,760
only showing half of her arguments and not the conclusion,

380
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
cherry-picking photographs,

381
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,120
and making weird comparisons to Anita's own appearance.

382
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,360
Thunderf00t, stop embarrassing yourself, man.

383
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,640
Give it up.

384
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
Your fans don't even want to watch this.

385
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,640
Stick to...

386
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,400
whatever else it is you do.

387
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,480
I- I don't know what you do.

388
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,880
Dicking about with thermal cameras or something.
