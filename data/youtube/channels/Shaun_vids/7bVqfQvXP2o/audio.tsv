0	8320	Hello, everyone. This is a video about YouTuber Thunderf00t, and specifically his latest video about Anita Sarkeesian,
8320	14240	entitled, Anita Sarkeesian Banned Sexy Girls in Video Games.
14240	21480	But first off, I wanna briefly look at a video he put out a few weeks ago called, somewhat obnoxiously,
21480	28240	I Don't Debate Enemies, I Bury Them, in which he's talking about ideas for future videos.
28240	29680	Let's take a listen.
30000	38320	Turns out, Anita Sarkeesian's again going with the, with the trope versus women in video games.
38320	46480	And... the whole thing is basically one giant cherry pick.
46480	54800	That's right, Anita Sarkeesian is at it once again, talking about sexism in video games.
54960	61760	How irrational of her to keep banging on that same drum over and over.
61760	66320	You'd really think she'd have something else to talk about by now, wouldn't you?
66320	69760	Now, before we move on, I just wanna point out two things here.
69760	73840	First off is Thunderf00t's use of the word cherry pick.
73840	77360	Apparently, he's not a fan of cherry picking.
77360	81520	Just file that away in your short-term memory for a little while.
81520	87920	Secondly, if we look at one of the top-rated comments on that video, Ted Cruz...
87920	90160	Ted Cruz, wow, says,
90160	99360	"'I don't care what you do, as long as it's not Anita. I'm fucking tired of her. Stick to science, 227 likes.'"
99360	103280	You see, Thunderf00t's got something of a thing for Anita,
103280	109840	and he doesn't seem to be able to shut up about her... at all. Ever.
109840	113920	And sure enough, against the emphatic objections of his audience,
113920	118640	he decided to make another video about Anita, and we're gonna talk about it.
118640	123120	So, first things first, it can be a little hard to follow Thunderf00t's point at times.
123120	130240	His video appears to be about 75% constructed out of older videos he's made about Anita Sarkeesian,
130240	135520	and as a result, he can tend to wander a little bit, or a lot, away from the point,
135520	139040	and he doesn't really stick to a clear argumentative thread.
139040	144000	So, I've had to do a lot of untangling of his arguments over the course of making this video,
144000	149280	and so, to avoid accusations of hypocrisy here, I'd recommend you go and watch his video.
149280	151200	I'll put a link in the description.
151200	156240	I'd encourage everyone to watch Anita's video and Thunderf00t's response,
156240	160960	and that way, you can be sure that I'm not misrepresenting his arguments.
160960	167280	Secondly, this is a video about how Thunderf00t misrepresents Anita's opinions and misleads his audience.
167280	172320	I'm not going to be talking about Anita Sarkeesian or the arguments in her videos
172320	178000	beyond explaining where Thunderf00t has misunderstood or misrepresented them.
178000	183920	I agree with some of Anita's points, and I disagree with others, but this video isn't about her,
183920	186800	so I'm not going to be going into any of that right now.
186800	190800	And with the disclaimers out of the way, let's get started.
190800	196560	So, Thunderf00t opens this video with Anita talking about Overwatch, and let's take a look.
196560	201040	The five female characters introduced consisted of the Slender Adventurer Tracer,
201040	205040	the Slender Healer Mercy, the Slender Support Character Symmetra,
205040	210800	the Slender Sniper Widowmaker, and the Slender but well-armored Security Chief Pharah.
210800	215040	Overwatch was hardly alone in having all of its female characters share a similar physique.
215040	218240	Well, I ain't that the truth, because in 20...
218240	222480	Now, massive Blizzard fanboy that I am, I noticed something here.
222480	224960	Watching Thunderf00t's clips of Anita,
224960	229280	she appears to be cherry-picking her examples from the Overwatch cast.
229280	234880	She seems to only be talking about certain characters in the game, and ignoring the other characters.
234880	238480	And I'm not the only one to notice this apparent oversight.
238480	240880	User Duaneef says,
240880	244480	What about Mei, Zarya, and Ana?
244480	246400	MoppyPuppy says,
246400	251680	Did Anita just skip over Mei and Zarya and expect no one to notice?
251680	253680	Zed7Games says,
253680	257520	I've don't seen the video, but she did miss Zarya?
257520	262320	I mean, that character invalidates her entire argument 100%.
262320	264320	User Charles Darwin...
264320	266000	Charles Darwin? Wow.
266000	266800	...says,
266800	272560	Doesn't Overwatch also have a female character named Mei who isn't exactly Slender?
272560	277040	But then again, facts never really mattered to Sarkeesian.
277040	283520	And there's a couple of hundred other people who all commented, echoing similar points.
283520	288320	For non-Overwatch players out there, there are three female characters in the game
288320	292400	that aren't the typical young and slender type that Anita's talking about.
292400	296240	There's Zarya, who is a large, muscled Russian weightlifter.
296800	300640	There's Ana, who's an older Egyptian sniper lady.
300640	305680	And there's Mei, who is lovely and amazing, and she's my friend.
305680	307920	So, what's going on here?
307920	311760	Is Anita really trying to get away with only mentioning the characters
311760	315200	that support her arguments, and not the characters that don't?
315920	319280	You know, why didn't Anita talk about these three characters?
319280	320480	Oh, but what's this?
321040	322960	He says, feigning shock.
323760	326000	She did mention those three characters.
326640	331600	Which means all the people scrolling past right now didn't watch Anita's video.
331600	336320	So let's do better than those guys, and actually watch Anita's video.
336320	339120	And here's the first time she mentions Overwatch.
339120	341280	At their annual BlizzCon event in 2014,
341280	343920	the wildly successful game studio Blizzard Entertainment
343920	346800	showed off a new game they had in the works called Overwatch.
346800	348560	And from that first reveal it was clear,
348560	351760	the appeal of Overwatch resided in its cast of characters.
351760	355520	A diverse assortment of heroes, each with unique traits and abilities.
355520	359680	You see, Anita is specifically talking about the 2014
359680	362000	Overwatch character announcement trailer,
362000	365120	which did not feature Zarya, Ana, or Mei.
365120	368560	And in which Bastion got a shield in front of him when he was in turret form,
368560	372960	which is frankly ridiculous and imbalanced, and I'm glad they ditched that.
372960	376560	And later on in Anita's video, when she's giving examples of games
376560	381760	which do feature women with different body types, she returns to Overwatch.
381760	383760	Let's go back to Overwatch for a moment.
383760	387360	Since that initial reveal, a few female heroes have been added to the roster.
387360	390960	There's Mei and Zarya, both of whom have body types that are notably different
390960	393360	from those of the originally announced female characters.
394800	396640	Ana, reporting for duty.
396640	399760	And more recently, Blizzard announced the game's next hero, Ana,
399760	402400	who's both an older woman and a woman of color.
402400	406960	And she goes on to call these character designs welcome and encouraging.
406960	410160	Of course, Thunderf00t neglected to show any of that in his video.
410160	414400	He edited out Anita's introduction of the trailer and neglected to mention it.
414400	418720	And he didn't show her talking positively about the other characters in the game.
418720	424160	And he therefore left his fans with an incorrect impression of Anita's arguments.
424160	427840	He actually cherry-picked in such a manner that led his fans to believe
427840	432960	Anita was the one cherry-picking, which is a neat trick, so well done in that regard.
434000	439280	After Overwatch, Anita moves on to talk about the character rosters of some other games.
439360	442000	And there's one particularly shameless example
442000	445840	of Thunderf00t taking what Anita says out of context here.
445840	450800	Let's first watch Anita's clip, and then we'll see what Thunderf00t does to it.
450800	455200	Similarly, when we look at the champions on offer in the hugely popular MOBA League of Legends,
455200	458720	we see the designers employing a wonderful range of body shapes and proportions
458720	460640	across dozens of male characters.
460640	463280	From the classic muscular warrior physique of Taric,
463280	465120	to the hefty beer belly of Gragas,
465120	468240	to the cartoonishly disproportionate body of Dr. Mundo,
468240	472800	there isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type,
472800	476640	and the value of these characters is definitely not connected to their sexual desirability.
477520	479120	But when we look at the female heroes,
479120	482560	there's nothing approaching the diversity we see on the male side of the roster.
482560	484800	And here's Thunderf00t's take on that bit.
484800	488400	While female heroes are mostly relegated to being standard humanoid characters
488400	490720	with conventionally attractive facial features,
490720	494960	female characters across the board are often limited to that same specific body type.
494960	499600	"-There isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type.
499600	504160	There isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type.
504160	508820	There isn't any one male body type that is presented as the standard default male body type.
508820	511280	Really, Anita? Yeah, sure about that."
511280	516240	You see, Anita was specifically talking about the lineup of League of Legends there.
516240	518880	Thunderf00t just lifted one line out of it,
518880	524240	and repeated it over and over, pretending that Anita was talking about all video games.
525440	528480	But she wasn't. Was she, Thunderf00t?
528480	534640	And the other audio clip is from when Anita is talking specifically about the lineup of Dota 2.
534640	539600	"-Likewise, in Dota 2, male heroes can be handsome or comical, outlandish or grotesque,
539600	543200	while female heroes are mostly relegated to being standard humanoid characters
543200	545760	with conventionally attractive facial features."
545760	550880	Thunderf00t took two out-of-context audio clips and stitched them together
550880	555120	to make it appear that Anita is arguing something that she isn't.
555120	558080	But even if we take Thunderf00t's point seriously here,
558080	560880	just look at some of the examples he's used to illustrate
560880	564080	that all men have a default body type in video games.
565040	568160	Firstly, Kratos, the god of war.
568720	575200	Secondly, Michael from GTA V, who is a middle-aged, slightly fat man.
575200	577840	So apparently, they're- they're the same thing.
578800	580960	They're the same thing in Thunderf00t's head.
581600	585680	So let's talk about another game that Thunderf00t misleads his audience over,
585680	588320	and that's the excellent Beyond Good and Evil.
588320	591440	"-Slender- Slender- Slender- Slender- Slender- Adventurer- Slender figure
591440	595040	with prominent breasts is viewed as the standard for female character design."
595040	599840	"-But oddly, that standard for female character design didn't stop feminist frequency
599840	605520	from recommending Jade from Beyond Good and Evil as a positive feminist character."
605520	608960	So I'll pause old Thunderf00t there just to point something out.
608960	614000	Um, in her video, Anita never said that Slender characters in games were sexist.
614000	618480	She never even said that having Slender characters in games was harmful.
618480	622400	Watch the following clip and see if you can't follow along with her argument.
622960	626080	"-Rather than seeing such an exciting range of female characters,
626080	628960	we mostly get the same body type over and over again.
628960	632800	One designed to be sexually appealing to the presumed straight male player.
632800	637760	This reliance on the same body type for so many female characters isn't just boring, it's harmful."
637760	639920	Now, which of the following did she say?
640560	642720	Slender characters in games are harmful?
643360	648640	Or, an over-reliance on one specific body type in games is harmful?
648640	652080	Now, some people seem to really struggle with this point, so I'll give you a hint.
652640	655920	Those two sentences do not say the same thing.
655920	661920	"-No one who was a slender, normatively beautiful, cut-price Lara Croft here.
661920	667760	You know, the one with the skin-tight pink top hugging Jade's normatively beautiful body
667760	671440	and revealing that fantastic pancake-flat midriff."
671440	674320	Now, if you watch Anita's video about Beyond Good and Evil,
674320	679760	she does actually address Jade's appearance, and she even calls Jade's top silly.
679760	682800	Thunderfunk neglected to include that in his video, obviously.
683600	686880	But for the most part, Anita is much more interested
686880	690720	in the presentation of Jade's character than her appearance.
690720	696640	She likes that Jade has everyday motivations, she's presented as smart and capable and all that.
696640	701920	You see, Thunderfunk, appearance isn't everything when it comes to character design.
701920	706960	And speaking of Jade's everyday motivations, here's what Thunderfunk has to say about that.
706960	712080	"-And of course, she had realistic concerns that normal people could relate to."
712080	714960	"-We definitely need more games with warm, compassionate,
714960	719120	multi-talented characters who have realistic and relatable concerns."
719120	722240	"-Like stopping a giant alien invasion."
722240	727920	Now, actually, Jade's relatable concerns that Anita's talking about in that section of her video
727920	732240	are paying the bills and taking care of her adopted family.
732240	737680	You see, if you watch a whole video and don't just cherry-pick lines out of it, this is obvious.
738640	741760	"-Games often give us heroes who are either fantastically wealthy,
741760	744480	like the Bruce Waynes and Lara Crofts of the world,
744480	747760	or who at least don't have practical everyday concerns about money.
748320	751040	But money's not just an abstract concept for Jade,
751040	754000	she's a working-class character with real financial struggles.
754560	758240	This is established at the very beginning of the game when we learn that the orphanage's
758240	762720	electricity has been shut off and Uncle Page's hovercraft is in dire need of repair."
763360	766560	And Thunderfunk has a bit more to say about Beyond Good and Evil.
766560	769520	"-Got damseled twice in one game."
770080	774480	"-But you are not like them. You are mine, Johnny.
774480	778080	And I am going to kill the human part of you."
785440	790320	"-Because while a damsel in distress reinforces long-standing regressive myths about women as a group..."
790320	798960	"-Come home."
798960	801760	So what he's done here is notice a few things.
802640	804720	Firstly, Anita likes Jade.
805680	809680	Secondly, Anita doesn't like damsels in distress.
809680	814160	And thirdly, Jade is helped out by a male character.
814160	819120	And then steam starts coming out of his ears and his head spins around like a cartoon robot
819120	820640	trying to divide by zero.
821360	822720	But here's what he missed.
822720	829760	"-Free yourself, Jade! I'll create a diversion!"
837440	841840	It may seem like a minor detail, but the fact that Page tells Jade to free herself
841840	844880	instead of doing it for her is incredibly important.
844880	847760	He assists her, but he doesn't rescue her.
847760	851120	He knows that even in this situation, she's far from helpless.
851120	856000	And the fact that Page treats her as a capable partner encourages us to see her that way too.
856000	860160	You see, Anita actually likes this take on the damsel thing.
860160	862720	She didn't ignore it or overlook it.
862720	865120	She thinks this is the way to do it right.
865680	870160	She even included Beyond Good and Evil as a positive example of a male character
870160	874560	helping a female character way back in her damsels in distress videos.
875520	879520	"-Now, I'm certainly not arguing that all stories must include completely fearless,
879520	883760	hyper-individualistic, heroic women who pull themselves up by their bootstraps
883760	885440	and never need anything from anyone.
886080	890240	Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with offering or occasionally needing assistance."
893040	896800	Of course, Thunderf00t neglected to mention any of that in his video.
896800	900880	And actually, he went a little further than just not mentioning it this time.
900960	905280	And this is me thinking like a video editor again here, but indulge me.
905280	908800	So Thunderf00t's making his video, and he wants to include the scene
908800	914240	where Jade is imprisoned by the alien thing so he can make his damsel in distress comparison.
914240	918880	And now, we know he has Anita's video on Beyond Good and Evil in his video editor
918880	923760	because he uses clips from it, which means he's already got the scene right there.
923760	929840	So why not take the easy path and just use this footage of the scene to illustrate his point?
929840	934480	Now, the problem for Thunderf00t here is the feminist frequency border on the video.
934480	937120	You see, having this border would tip his audience off
937120	940720	to the fact that Anita does actually talk about this scene.
940720	946720	So instead of using that footage, he has to go out and specifically download the cutscene by itself.
946720	951760	And this gives his audience the impression that Anita doesn't address that part of the game.
951760	953920	Is that intentional or unintentional?
954800	955680	Who knows.
955680	958960	Now, the next cherry pick of Thunderf00t's that I want to talk about
958960	962480	has to do with Anita's appearance at the unhelpfully named
963120	965680	The Conference in Sweden last year.
966400	968400	And let's watch the start of his argument.
985840	992560	So first things first, all of the games that Anita has ever found problematic have an adult rating.
993680	996480	All of them? Well, that's what he said.
996480	1001760	So either Thunderf00t is just exaggerating in order to mislead his audience,
1001760	1005360	or he thinks Super Princess Peach has an M rating.
1005920	1009920	You see, Anita talks about problematic things in all kinds of games,
1009920	1012160	not just ones with a mature rating.
1012160	1017680	And talking about problematic things in a game doesn't mean you automatically have to hate it.
1018320	1022640	I mean, a lot of Anita's videos even start out with that exact disclaimer.
1032640	1035680	Now let's watch the next part of Thunderf00t's argument.
1035680	1048080	And here's where the cherry pick comes in.
1048080	1053520	If you watch Anita's full talk at the The Conference, stupid name,
1053520	1058000	you'll see that in this section, Anita is talking specifically about attitudes
1058000	1062160	towards casual gamers and what are considered casual games.
1065680	1079120	The image she puts up are all games of a specific type,
1079120	1083760	because they're the kinds of games she's talking about in that part of her speech.
1083760	1088480	She didn't just come out and apropos of nothing show a slide of some games and say,
1088560	1090800	These are my favorite video games.
1090800	1093040	You know, it's got a context.
1093040	1097840	She's talking about patronizing attitudes towards casual gamers.
1097840	1101200	That's why she has an image of some casual games.
1101200	1105280	And speaking of patronizing, let's watch Thunderf00t prove her point for her.
1118480	1131920	Now, the next part of Thunderf00t's video I want to talk about
1131920	1134480	strays into some weird territory.
1134480	1135440	Let's give it a watch.
1140000	1142400	Well, Anita, allow me to tell you.
1142400	1144160	It's to make her look good.
1144160	1146960	And before you launch into a diatribe about how all those
1146960	1151360	gender signifies to mean all women and reduce them to mere sex objects,
1151360	1156480	you know, because it's not like you in real life would ever use appearance enhancing cosmetics,
1156480	1163200	you know, like like bright red lipstick to imply arousal or eye makeup to draw people's attention
1163200	1168960	to your eyes or midriff bearing outfits, high heels to add height and hip sway for the
1169440	1170640	evil male gaze.
1170640	1175760	And of course, why not a low cut figure hugging top to draw your
1175760	1180720	presumably straight male audience's attention to that part of your body.
1180720	1186400	So first off here, Thunderf00t, Philip, what the fuck, man?
1186400	1187600	Are you doing okay?
1187600	1190720	Like in general, is everything all right over there, dude?
1190720	1194080	Because that's some weird shit you just did right there.
1194800	1197680	Secondly, let's look at this argument here.
1198400	1200000	You know, if we can find it.
1200800	1206640	So I think he's saying that because Anita criticizes video game women
1207360	1213280	who are presented like this, she shouldn't dress like this.
1214480	1216560	So let's unravel this thing.
1216560	1219680	The video where Anita talks about this character is called
1219680	1224400	Lingerie is Not Armor, and it's about inappropriate clothing in games.
1225040	1229680	Now the character in question is some sort of special forces operative or something
1229680	1235040	from a Resident Evil game, but she dresses inappropriately for the job.
1235040	1235840	That's the point.
1236480	1239200	It's not that she's trying to look good.
1239200	1243680	It's that she's trying to look good while fighting off a zombie invasion
1243680	1244800	or whatever it is she does.
1245360	1247360	Her clothes don't fit her role.
1247920	1251280	None of this is to say that characters in games should never be sexual.
1251280	1252320	Far from it.
1252320	1255520	Sexuality and sexualization are very different things.
1256160	1259840	The sexualization of female characters is about designing them, dressing them,
1259840	1262560	or framing them in ways that are specifically intended
1262560	1266160	to be sexually appealing to presumed male viewers or players.
1266160	1269440	Anita's not saying women shouldn't ever try to look good.
1270080	1273680	The argument's about appropriate clothing for a situation.
1273680	1278080	And one example of a time when it is appropriate to dress up and try and look nice
1278080	1280240	is a fancy launch event for your new thing.
1280880	1282000	Whatever the thing was.
1282640	1284080	Additionally, Thunderf-
1285280	1286800	What's a midriff?
1286800	1290080	Eye makeup to draw people's attention to your eyes.
1290080	1292080	Or midriff-bearing outfits.
1292080	1292960	A midriff?
1293520	1294320	Well, that's okay.
1294320	1296560	Maybe you just misspoke that one time.
1296560	1300320	And revealing that fantastic pancake-flat midriff.
1300320	1301120	Oh, right.
1301120	1302720	He thinks it's called a midriff.
1303280	1305360	Okay, Phil, I'm gonna do you a favor now.
1305360	1307200	You see this part of the body here?
1307760	1308880	That's a midriff.
1309680	1311520	There's no such thing as a midriff.
1312240	1315520	And Thunderf- isn't done talking about this launch event.
1315520	1318960	Why is he even looking up photographs of Anita Sarkeesian?
1318960	1323600	And when I say white male, I mean white male.
1323600	1328800	This is the premiere of Anita Sarkeesian's new video series about ordinary women.
1328800	1330080	I've got a game for you.
1330080	1335440	It's called spot the woman or minority in his social justice warrior hipster crowd.
1336160	1340320	And if your cherry-pick detector isn't going off by now, I'd get it looked at.
1341120	1344800	You see, I went and looked up all the other photographs of this event.
1344800	1350160	And so, as crass and stupid as this is, and with my full apologies,
1350800	1355920	let's play spot the minority with your host, Thunderf00t.
1355920	1359920	And when I say white male, I mean white male.
1360560	1365760	This is the premiere of Anita Sarkeesian's new video series about ordinary women.
1365760	1367040	I've got a game for you.
1367040	1372400	It's called spot the woman or minority in his social justice warrior hipster crowd.
1373040	1375840	So, the last instance of cherry picking I want to talk about
1375840	1379760	is the clip that Thunderf00t chooses to close his video out on.
1379760	1382240	And he really did save the best for last.
1382240	1386160	Rather than taking you as the archetypal straw feminist
1386160	1389200	that you complained about all those many years ago.
1389200	1393520	You know, the one who finds every slight little thing sexist.
1393520	1396480	The girls are influenced by Femme Fatale's malicious rhetoric
1396480	1400880	to see benign, routine, everyday things as a conspiracy against women,
1400880	1402080	and against them personally.
1402880	1405440	Everything is sexist, everything is racist,
1405440	1408720	everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.
1409680	1412000	Well, that seems fairly damning, doesn't it?
1412000	1414560	Straight from the horse's mouth, as they say.
1414560	1416800	Everything's racist and sexist.
1417520	1420320	Every little thing, that's what she said.
1421040	1425040	But I don't know, something about that clip seemed a little off to me
1425040	1427440	and my cherry pick detector was going off again,
1427440	1433120	so I decided to go and look up the circumstances in which Anita said this statement.
1433120	1435120	Which is harder than it seems, you know.
1435120	1439280	Unlike old Thunderf00t there, I don't have a folder on my desktop
1439280	1444320	filled with videos of Anita Sarkeesian and photographs of Anita Sarkeesian
1444320	1446640	and articles written by Anita Sarkeesian,
1447440	1450240	secret love letters to Anita Sarkeesian, and so on,
1450240	1452320	so I just had to go googling for it.
1453200	1456880	And I found it. It's from All About Women 2015,
1456880	1461680	the How To Be A Feminist panel, at around 33 minutes in.
1461680	1463520	And before we watch the full clip,
1463520	1467280	let's just once again see how Thunderf00t chose to present it.
1467280	1470240	The girls are influenced by Femme Fatale's malicious rhetoric
1470320	1474640	to see benign, routine, everyday things as a conspiracy against women
1474640	1475920	and against them personally.
1476720	1479280	Everything is sexist, everything is racist,
1479280	1482480	everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.
1483120	1485120	And now here's the actual clip.
1486240	1490800	I'm intrigued by Anita, I'll come back to you, I'm intrigued by Anita saying
1490800	1492880	she had to learn about systems,
1493440	1497840	you had to learn about the sociology of systems and structural change,
1497840	1500720	and it was obviously quite a journey for you.
1500720	1502000	Yeah, absolutely.
1502000	1505120	I sort of joke about how it was the most liberating thing
1505120	1506080	that ever happened to me,
1506080	1508480	and also the most frustrating for everyone around me.
1508480	1510640	Because when you start learning about systems,
1511360	1515120	everything is sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic,
1515120	1519440	and you have to point it all out to everyone all the time.
1519440	1520800	So there's a good year of my life.
1523040	1524640	There's a good year of my life where it was just,
1524640	1526560	I was the most obnoxious person to be around.
1527280	1530800	And there's not really much I need to say about that, I don't think.
1531760	1536720	So some closing thoughts on Thunderf00t's weird obsession with Anita Sarkeesian.
1537360	1541920	You'd really think that after so much practice arguing against Anita,
1541920	1544480	Thunderf00t would be better at it.
1544480	1547840	If Anita's arguments were so easily refuted,
1547840	1551440	Thunderf00t wouldn't have to resort to twisting her words,
1551440	1553360	showing out-of-context clips,
1553920	1557760	only showing half of her arguments and not the conclusion,
1557760	1559760	cherry-picking photographs,
1559760	1563120	and making weird comparisons to Anita's own appearance.
1563760	1567360	Thunderf00t, stop embarrassing yourself, man.
1568080	1568640	Give it up.
1569200	1571360	Your fans don't even want to watch this.
1572080	1572640	Stick to...
1574320	1576400	whatever else it is you do.
1576400	1578480	I- I don't know what you do.
1578480	1580880	Dicking about with thermal cameras or something.
