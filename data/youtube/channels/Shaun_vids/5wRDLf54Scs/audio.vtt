00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about anti-vaccine propaganda.

00:05.200 --> 00:10.700
Now, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has obviously seen rise to a lot of discussion of vaccines,

00:10.700 --> 00:14.800
and also, sadly, a lot of awful anti-vaccine arguments.

00:14.800 --> 00:20.000
And for examples of how this sort of propaganda works, we're going to take a look at The Jimmy Dore Show.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.300
Now, Jimmy Dore is a comedian and political commentator who hosts The Jimmy Dore Show here on YouTube,

00:26.300 --> 00:29.600
on a channel with around 900,000 subscribers.

00:29.600 --> 00:36.700
If you aren't familiar with The Jimmy Dore Show, Jimmy Dore styles himself as someone who critiques the political establishment,

00:36.700 --> 00:39.300
including the Democrats, from the left.

00:39.300 --> 00:43.400
And until recently, his commentary on vaccines followed that approach.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.200
On December 21st of last year, Dore put out a video titled,

00:47.200 --> 00:50.200
Vaccine for Elites, but Not for Nurses,

00:50.200 --> 00:56.200
in which he expresses his anger that healthcare executives were getting vaccinated before frontline workers.

00:56.300 --> 01:00.000
On April 30th of this year, Dore put out a video titled,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.100
Bill Gates Denies Vaccine to Poor Countries,

01:03.100 --> 01:08.500
in which he criticizes Gates for arguing in favor of patent protections on vaccines.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.000
And on the 2nd of March of last year, he put out a video titled,

01:12.000 --> 01:18.300
Pelosi, Corona Vaccine Should Be Affordable, WTF, where he says the following.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.800
She wants to make the vaccines affordable.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.800
She is a virus.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.900
Yes, what kind of, you have to have a virus in your brain to think that, hey,

01:27.900 --> 01:30.400
you know, we could, we could, well, here's what I said.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.500
Of course, we could distribute the vaccine to all citizens as soon as it's available and stop a pandemic,

01:35.500 --> 01:37.500
but we're not filthy socialists.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.200
So lots of people are going to die.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.600
That's what she's saying.

01:43.600 --> 01:52.000
A functioning government would fucking inoculated citizenry against a goddamn pandemic and forget about a fucking profit motive.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.500
So from these videos and others, Dore's position appears to be that vaccines are a good thing,

01:57.500 --> 02:01.700
that they should be free, available to everyone regardless of status,

02:01.700 --> 02:08.000
and that distributing the vaccine to all citizens as soon as it's available would stop the pandemic.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
However, recently, something strange has been going on over at the Jimmy Dore show.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.500
Dore has taken a hard turn into peddling anti-vaccine propaganda in videos that are absolutely full of deception,

02:20.500 --> 02:23.600
flawed logic, and outright lies.

02:23.600 --> 02:29.400
As for why this is, you only need to go to his channel and look at the view counts on his recent videos.

02:29.400 --> 02:34.500
His anti-vaccine videos are some of the most popular content he's produced this year.

02:34.500 --> 02:42.400
Bringing in a piece of the anti-vaccine audience provides a real financial incentive to keep producing that sort of content,

02:42.400 --> 02:48.000
because some of those new viewers attracted by the anti-vaccine content will become premium members,

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
or head over to the Jimmy Dore Comedy Store, where they can buy mugs and hoodies and bags and hats and shirts and so on.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.500
Now, you might say,

02:57.500 --> 02:59.400
hold up there a second, Sean.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.700
Maybe this is an unfair criticism.

03:01.700 --> 03:04.700
Maybe this has nothing to do with money or chasing views.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.100
Maybe this is just a coincidence.

03:07.100 --> 03:13.700
Maybe Jimmy Dore just genuinely believes in the anti-vaccine arguments he feels compelled to share with the world.

03:13.700 --> 03:17.200
Maybe he's just not had good counterarguments yet.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.200
And I will admit that this is a possibility.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.000
A slight possibility.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.500
So, let's take a look at some of these arguments, then.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.900
The first video I want to look at is titled,

03:27.900 --> 03:34.600
Outbreak! 80% Vaccinated Singapore Has More Infections Than Ever, Released on October 6th.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.900
This video features Dore reading out an article from Fortune.com titled,

03:38.900 --> 03:41.800
Highly Vaccinated But More Cases Than Ever.

03:41.800 --> 03:47.100
Singapore Shows The World What Endemic COVID Might Look Like, written by Grady McGregor.

03:47.100 --> 03:51.600
And this video from Dore is a real masterclass in misleading an audience.

03:51.600 --> 03:57.800
And to see what Dore does here, we're gonna read this article along with him and see how he represents it.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.600
So, the article starts out,

03:59.600 --> 04:04.800
highly vaccinated Singapore is battling a record wave of COVID-19 infections,

04:04.800 --> 04:07.500
just as the city plans to reopen to the world.

04:07.500 --> 04:12.300
But Singapore's 80% vaccination rate has kept severe cases and deaths down,

04:12.300 --> 04:19.300
potentially proving that living with the virus versus trying to eradicate it is the surest path out of the pandemic.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.500
Now, here's how Jimmy Dore starts reading the article.

04:24.600 --> 04:29.800
On Monday, Singapore recorded 1,647 cases of COVID-19,

04:29.800 --> 04:35.800
bringing its seven-day daily average to 1,545 cases,

04:35.900 --> 04:39.400
higher than any other previous wave of the pandemic.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.000
So what he did there was skip the first paragraph,

04:42.000 --> 04:46.800
the one that states that Singapore's high vaccination rate has kept severe cases and deaths down,

04:46.800 --> 04:51.800
and he started reading at the second paragraph, talking about the recent increase in COVID cases.

04:51.800 --> 04:56.800
So he's avoided mentioning the positive effects of the high vaccination rate there.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.300
But let's not draw any conclusions right now.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.900
So, following this sentence read out by Dore, the article says,

05:02.900 --> 05:07.200
But even as cases soar, COVID-19 deaths in Singapore have remained low.

05:07.200 --> 05:12.200
The city's state of 5.7 million people has averaged three deaths per day in the last week.

05:12.200 --> 05:16.200
Singapore's saving grace is its high vaccination coverage.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.200
So let's hear Jimmy read that.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.400
Uh, hang on, where is he?

05:29.400 --> 05:32.700
Oh, he skipped down to here, the sentence that starts out,

05:35.700 --> 05:40.700
So that's twice now that he's skipped mentioning the positive effects of vaccination.

05:40.700 --> 05:44.200
Now, the sentence following this one also mentions Singapore's low death rate.

05:44.200 --> 05:44.700
It says,

05:54.700 --> 05:56.700
So, let's listen to Jimmy read that.

05:59.700 --> 06:04.700
Singapore has now fully vaccinated over 80% of its population,

06:04.700 --> 06:07.700
one of the highest rates in the world!

06:07.700 --> 06:09.700
No, he's gone again.

06:09.700 --> 06:14.700
Now he's back up here, having expertly dodged multiple separate instances of the article

06:14.700 --> 06:18.200
directly praising Singapore's high vaccination rate.

06:18.200 --> 06:23.700
The best that Jimmy Dore manages is showing this one reference to quote,

06:23.700 --> 06:26.200
But he does not make clear, as the article does,

06:26.500 --> 06:30.500
that this widespread immunity is due in large part to the high vaccination rate.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.500
And this is how Jimmy reads out the rest of the article.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.500
Well, no, he's not reading the article, really.

06:36.500 --> 06:41.500
He's picking particular sentences out of it in order to present a biased view of it.

06:41.500 --> 06:46.500
This is an article about how Singapore's high vaccination rate has kept deaths low

06:46.500 --> 06:50.500
even as virus cases increase as the country eases lockdown restrictions.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
It's a success story.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.800
Jimmy Dore, by refusing to mention the positive effects of vaccination,

06:56.800 --> 07:00.800
turns it into a scaremongering article about an increase in cases

07:00.800 --> 07:02.800
in order to make the vaccine look ineffective.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.800
Now, further down the article,

07:04.800 --> 07:08.800
Jimmy Dore does something even worse than simply selectively quote the article.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.800
He actually changes the text in order to better suit his argument.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.800
So, first, let's read the relevant part of the article.

07:17.100 --> 07:21.100
Throughout July and August, cases in Singapore ticked up to over 100 per day

07:21.100 --> 07:27.100
after nearly a year of almost no infections due to the city's previous zero tolerance policy.

07:27.100 --> 07:31.100
That policy included stay-at-home orders, intensive testing and contact tracing,

07:31.100 --> 07:33.100
and a ban on foreign visitors.

07:33.100 --> 07:37.100
This month, cases have risen exponentially from 180 on September 1st

07:37.100 --> 07:41.100
to roughly 500 by mid-September and to nearly 1,500 this week.

07:41.100 --> 07:45.100
On Monday, Singapore said that it would reintroduce some social distancing measures

07:45.400 --> 07:48.400
including reducing dining groups from five to two people at restaurants

07:48.400 --> 07:51.400
and directing companies to allow employees to work from home.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.400
Singapore's government said the measures will be in place for at least one month

07:54.400 --> 07:56.400
to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed

07:56.400 --> 08:00.400
and to allow the city to scale up services to help infected patients recover at home.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.400
So what's happened here, according to this article anyway,

08:03.400 --> 08:06.400
is that Singapore had very strict lockdown measures

08:06.400 --> 08:09.400
and a low number of coronavirus cases.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.400
Once a large percentage of the country was vaccinated, however,

08:12.700 --> 08:14.700
they started easing those lockdown measures

08:14.700 --> 08:18.700
which led, of course, expectedly, to an increase in cases.

08:18.700 --> 08:21.700
But since the country has a very high vaccination rate,

08:21.700 --> 08:23.700
the number of deaths remained low.

08:23.700 --> 08:27.700
The vaccine, of course, does not make you completely immune from catching the virus

08:27.700 --> 08:31.700
but it does make it much, much less likely that you will develop serious symptoms

08:31.700 --> 08:34.700
or die as a result of catching the virus.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.700
However, Singapore is still wary of overloading its hospitals

08:38.700 --> 08:41.700
so is planning to reintroduce lockdown measures as needed

08:41.700 --> 08:44.000
in order to control the number of cases.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
This all makes perfect sense.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Very strict lockdown orders, then a high vaccination rate,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
then a lifting of those orders leading to increasing cases

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
with some orders reintroduced in order to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
This is not too hard to follow, you'd think.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
But Singapore's growing caseload has raised alarms, nonetheless,

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
because of the speed at which cases have climbed.

09:08.300 --> 09:11.300
Despite policies including stay-at-home orders,

09:11.300 --> 09:14.300
intensive testing and contact tracing,

09:14.300 --> 09:17.300
and a ban on foreign visitors,

09:17.300 --> 09:20.300
and 80% of them are vaccinated,

09:20.300 --> 09:22.300
they're having the biggest outbreak ever.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.300
Now, sharp-eyed viewers will have noticed

09:25.300 --> 09:29.300
that what Daw just read out is not what the article says.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.300
And let's look at them side by side here.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.300
The article says,

09:32.600 --> 09:36.600
Throughout July and August, cases in Singapore ticked up to over 100 per day

09:36.600 --> 09:39.600
after nearly a year of almost no infections

09:39.600 --> 09:42.600
due to the city's previous zero tolerance policy.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.600
Emphasis on the word previous there.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
Then it goes on to say,

09:46.600 --> 09:49.600
That policy included stay-at-home orders,

09:49.600 --> 09:51.600
intensive testing and so on.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.600
Jimmy Daw's text says,

09:53.600 --> 09:57.600
The speed at which cases have climbed despite policies

09:57.600 --> 10:01.600
including stay-at-home orders, intensive testing and so on.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.900
He snips out the sentence,

10:03.900 --> 10:06.900
making it clear that these policies were the previous policies,

10:06.900 --> 10:08.900
the policies that were lifted,

10:08.900 --> 10:11.900
and he puts the word despite in there.

10:11.900 --> 10:14.900
Now, the word despite is not in this paragraph in the original article,

10:14.900 --> 10:18.900
and this makes it seem like these policies are current, ongoing policies.

10:18.900 --> 10:23.900
He's rewriting what the article says to make it say something different.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.900
Now, I'd like to pause here and ask a question

10:25.900 --> 10:29.900
to any fans of Jimmy Daw's content that might be watching this video.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.200
Now, I know that the response to me saying

10:32.200 --> 10:35.200
Jimmy Daw produces anti-vaccine content will be to say,

10:35.200 --> 10:36.200
No, he doesn't.

10:36.200 --> 10:40.200
Daw doesn't directly tell anyone not to get the vaccine.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.200
He got the vaccine.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.200
And he says that you can get the vaccine if you like.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.200
You know, he's not anti-vaccine.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.200
He's just asking questions.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.200
He's just got some concerns.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.200
He's just reporting the vaccine news.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.200
Now, my question is, if this was true,

10:54.200 --> 10:57.200
if Jimmy Daw really was just innocently asking questions

10:57.200 --> 10:59.200
and provoking debate,

10:59.500 --> 11:01.500
why does he need to lie?

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
Why is he selectively quoting the article

11:03.500 --> 11:06.500
to avoid mentioning the positive effects of vaccination?

11:06.500 --> 11:09.500
Why is he editing the text of the article

11:09.500 --> 11:11.500
to make lockdown measures seem ineffective?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
If he was just reporting the news,

11:13.500 --> 11:16.500
he would just read out the article in full, right?

11:16.500 --> 11:18.500
If he's just asking questions,

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
why not ask,

11:19.500 --> 11:23.500
Why does Singapore have one of the lowest COVID death rates in the world?

11:23.500 --> 11:25.500
And the answer is because Jimmy Daw

11:25.500 --> 11:28.500
is trying to present a biased view of vaccines.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.800
He is producing content specifically

11:30.800 --> 11:33.800
to attempt to draw in an anti-vaccine audience.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.800
He's just doing it with plausible deniability,

11:36.800 --> 11:38.800
because he doesn't want to be banned by YouTube.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.800
But let's be fair here.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.800
Maybe you're thinking,

11:42.800 --> 11:44.800
Well, okay, the way Jimmy Daw read out that one article

11:44.800 --> 11:46.800
was a bit dodgy,

11:46.800 --> 11:48.800
but I'm not ready to brand him a liar over it.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.800
I need more evidence for that.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.800
So, okay, how about this?

11:52.800 --> 11:54.800
On the 14th of October,

11:54.800 --> 11:56.800
the site healthfeedback.org

11:57.100 --> 11:59.100
published an article that was critical

11:59.100 --> 12:01.100
of Jimmy Daw's statements about COVID-19.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.100
And in particular here,

12:03.100 --> 12:05.100
we're interested in their criticism of his statements

12:05.100 --> 12:07.100
about the drug ivermectin.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.100
They say,

12:23.100 --> 12:25.100
While it is true that ivermectin is used in humans

12:25.400 --> 12:27.400
and that the scientist who discovered it

12:27.400 --> 12:29.400
won a Nobel Prize,

12:29.400 --> 12:31.400
what Daw didn't tell his viewers

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
was that neither of those facts have any bearing

12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
on whether ivermectin is effective against COVID-19,

12:35.400 --> 12:37.400
specifically.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.400
Reliable studies haven't shown that ivermectin

12:39.400 --> 12:41.400
is effective against COVID-19.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.400
So, apparently, Jimmy Daw has been spreading

12:43.400 --> 12:45.400
inaccurate information about ivermectin,

12:45.400 --> 12:47.400
telling his audience

12:47.400 --> 12:49.400
that ivermectin is effective in treating COVID,

12:49.400 --> 12:51.400
which would be very irresponsible.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.400
However,

12:53.700 --> 12:55.700
in a video posted to YouTube on the 19th of October,

12:55.700 --> 12:57.700
Jimmy Daw defended himself

12:57.700 --> 12:59.700
against the claims in this article

12:59.700 --> 13:01.700
by saying that they're all made up.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.400
So, according to Jimmy Daw,

13:25.400 --> 13:27.400
he's never said anything like the claims in the article.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
He's never said ivermectin is effective in treating COVID.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.400
However,

13:53.400 --> 13:55.400
Uh-oh.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.400
Now, if you go looking for that video

13:57.400 --> 13:59.400
on Jimmy Daw's YouTube channel,

13:59.400 --> 14:01.400
you won't find it.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.400
It's actually specifically against

14:03.400 --> 14:05.400
YouTube's content policies to post videos

14:05.400 --> 14:07.400
that feature, quote,

14:07.400 --> 14:09.400
categorical claims that ivermectin

14:09.400 --> 14:11.400
is an effective treatment for COVID-19.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.400
So, did YouTube delete that video?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.400
Did Jimmy Daw take it down,

14:15.400 --> 14:17.400
perhaps in preparation for COVID-19?

14:17.400 --> 14:19.400
So, did YouTube delete that video?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.400
Did Jimmy Daw take it down?

14:21.400 --> 14:23.400
Perhaps in preparation to claim

14:23.400 --> 14:25.400
that he never said exactly

14:25.400 --> 14:27.400
what he did say in the video?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.400
I don't know.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.400
What Jimmy can't take down, though,

14:31.400 --> 14:33.400
is his appearance on Joe Rogan's show.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.400
So, what about, uh, like,

14:35.400 --> 14:37.400
can we talk about ivermectin?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.400
Yeah, sure.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.400
So, I covered it,

14:41.400 --> 14:43.400
what they did in Mexico City,

14:43.400 --> 14:45.400
and ivermectin seems to be

14:45.400 --> 14:47.400
a drug that not only treats it,

14:47.400 --> 14:49.400
but it will prevent you from getting it.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.400
Well, now, according to Jimmy Daw,

14:51.400 --> 14:53.400
ivermectin doesn't just seem

14:53.400 --> 14:55.400
like it treats COVID,

14:55.400 --> 14:57.400
it will actually stop you from getting it

14:57.400 --> 14:59.400
altogether. Now, if you watched that clip,

14:59.400 --> 15:01.400
it's quite funny, because by making

15:01.400 --> 15:03.400
such a direct medical claim,

15:03.400 --> 15:05.400
he clearly worries Rogan a bit,

15:05.400 --> 15:07.400
who starts saying, well, we need more studies,

15:07.400 --> 15:09.400
you know, I'm just an MMA guy,

15:09.400 --> 15:11.400
don't listen to me about health stuff.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.400
Rogan's clearly also worried about the

15:13.400 --> 15:15.400
wrath of the YouTube censors.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.400
And speaking of, Jimmy Daw's

15:17.400 --> 15:19.400
last video, YouTube's new censorship

15:19.400 --> 15:21.400
rampage over vaccines,

15:21.400 --> 15:23.400
starts out with Daw making a rather

15:23.400 --> 15:25.400
embarrassing error.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.400
And I wish I had Glenn Greenwald on to talk

15:27.400 --> 15:29.400
about this with me, but the irony here

15:29.400 --> 15:31.400
is that

15:31.400 --> 15:33.400
inside this article,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.400
talking about how YouTube's

15:35.400 --> 15:37.400
gonna stop misinformation about vaccines,

15:37.400 --> 15:39.400
it includes misinformation

15:39.400 --> 15:41.400
about vaccines.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.400
This is from the AP,

15:43.400 --> 15:45.400
this will not be censored at

15:45.400 --> 15:47.400
Twitter, this will not be censored at,

15:47.400 --> 15:49.400
this is misinformation.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.400
That is not true.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.400
Scientists do not say

15:53.400 --> 15:55.400
that the vaccines will end

15:55.400 --> 15:57.400
the COVID-19 pandemic.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.400
That is not what they say.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.400
Do you want to know what they say?

16:03.400 --> 16:05.400
COVID-19 won't be

16:05.400 --> 16:07.400
eradicated. Who says that?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.400
The who? The WHO.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.400
The World Health

16:11.400 --> 16:13.400
Organization says that.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.400
The AP is misinforming

16:15.400 --> 16:17.400
you. So do you understand

16:17.400 --> 16:19.400
why there shouldn't be censorship ever?

16:19.400 --> 16:21.400
So Daw first shows this article

16:21.400 --> 16:23.400
from the AP which states that scientists

16:23.400 --> 16:25.400
say public acceptance of

16:25.400 --> 16:27.400
free immunizations will end the

16:27.400 --> 16:29.400
COVID-19 pandemic.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.400
Then he shows this article from TheHill.com

16:31.400 --> 16:33.400
which states global health experts

16:33.400 --> 16:35.400
say COVID-19 won't

16:35.400 --> 16:37.400
be eradicated. Now Daw

16:37.400 --> 16:39.400
treats these quotes as if they're contradictory

16:39.400 --> 16:41.400
and goes on for several minutes about

16:41.400 --> 16:43.400
how this proves the press is lying to you

16:43.400 --> 16:45.400
and you can't censor independent voices

16:45.400 --> 16:47.400
like his, and so on.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.400
However, he's made a mistake here

16:49.400 --> 16:51.400
because these two quotes are not contradictory.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.400
Ending the current

16:53.400 --> 16:55.400
COVID-19 pandemic can be done

16:55.400 --> 16:57.400
without eradicating COVID-19

16:57.400 --> 16:59.400
because the word pandemic describes

16:59.400 --> 17:01.400
the state, not the existence

17:01.400 --> 17:03.400
of the virus. With sufficient

17:03.400 --> 17:05.400
resistance to the virus, the worldwide pandemic

17:05.400 --> 17:07.400
would end, even if the virus

17:07.400 --> 17:09.400
itself continues to circulate.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.400
And one of the best ways to increase a population's

17:11.400 --> 17:13.400
resistance to the virus is

17:13.400 --> 17:15.400
widespread vaccination. Now you'd

17:15.400 --> 17:17.400
think Jimmy Daw would know this, since

17:17.400 --> 17:19.400
as we saw earlier, he stated last

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
year that distributing the vaccine to

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
all citizens as soon as it's available

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
would stop the pandemic. Now this

17:25.400 --> 17:27.400
either means that Jimmy Daw believes that

17:27.400 --> 17:29.400
ending the pandemic necessarily entails

17:29.400 --> 17:31.400
entirely wiping out the virus,

17:31.400 --> 17:33.400
and I don't believe he's that clueless,

17:33.400 --> 17:35.400
or it means that he did understand

17:35.400 --> 17:37.400
that widespread vaccination could end

17:37.400 --> 17:39.400
the pandemic as he stated, and he's

17:39.400 --> 17:41.400
just decided to forget

17:41.400 --> 17:43.400
that information, for some

17:43.400 --> 17:45.400
reason. Next up, I want

17:45.400 --> 17:47.400
to give an example of how bad scientific

17:47.400 --> 17:49.400
practices can give rise to

17:49.400 --> 17:51.400
anti-vaccine myths. So let's

17:51.400 --> 17:53.400
start with the Jimmy Daw video study

17:53.400 --> 17:55.400
Vaccines Being Administered Incorrectly,

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
and we will track this claim back

17:57.400 --> 17:59.400
to the source. So in this video,

17:59.400 --> 18:01.400
Jimmy Daw is arguing that the way

18:01.400 --> 18:03.400
COVID-19 vaccines are administered

18:03.400 --> 18:05.400
is incorrect and dangerous,

18:05.400 --> 18:07.400
and he does this by watching and repeating

18:07.400 --> 18:09.400
the arguments of a different YouTube video

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
that being inadvertent intravenous

18:11.400 --> 18:13.400
injections from a YouTuber

18:13.400 --> 18:15.400
called John Campbell. In that

18:15.400 --> 18:17.400
video, Campbell is reading out the study

18:17.400 --> 18:19.400
Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus

18:19.400 --> 18:21.400
Disease 2019 MRNA

18:21.400 --> 18:23.400
Vaccine Can Induce Acute

18:23.400 --> 18:25.400
Myopericarditis in

18:25.400 --> 18:27.400
Mouse Model. So what did this

18:27.400 --> 18:29.400
study investigate? Well, the COVID-19

18:29.400 --> 18:31.400
vaccine is an intramuscular

18:31.400 --> 18:33.400
or IM injection,

18:33.400 --> 18:35.400
meaning it's injected into a muscle,

18:35.400 --> 18:37.400
typically the deltoid. This

18:37.400 --> 18:39.400
study attempts to discover what would happen with

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
an intravenous or IV

18:41.400 --> 18:43.400
injection of the vaccine, meaning it's injected

18:43.400 --> 18:45.400
directly into the bloodstream.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.400
So they injected some mice with

18:47.400 --> 18:49.400
the vaccine, some with IM

18:49.400 --> 18:51.400
injections, some with IV injections.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.400
Later, they dissected

18:53.400 --> 18:55.400
the mice, the poor

18:55.400 --> 18:57.400
mice, and they report that they found

18:57.400 --> 18:59.400
myopericarditis in the IV

18:59.400 --> 19:01.400
group, myopericarditis

19:01.400 --> 19:03.400
being an inflammation of parts of

19:03.400 --> 19:05.400
the heart. So the conclusion this

19:05.400 --> 19:07.400
far would seem to be that IV injection

19:07.400 --> 19:09.400
of the vaccine can be bad for the heart.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.400
Emphasis on seem

19:11.400 --> 19:13.400
to be. Please do not actually

19:13.400 --> 19:15.400
make any conclusions right now. Stick with

19:15.400 --> 19:17.400
me to the end of this bit. Trust me, there

19:17.400 --> 19:19.400
is a twist up ahead. Now of

19:19.400 --> 19:21.400
course, in humans, the vaccine is

19:21.400 --> 19:23.400
injected in a muscle and not

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
intravenously, so we might say

19:25.400 --> 19:27.400
what's the problem, right? Just don't

19:27.400 --> 19:29.400
inject it intravenously and we're okay.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.400
But what the authors of this study

19:31.400 --> 19:33.400
are concerned about is the possibility of

19:33.400 --> 19:35.400
an accidental intravenous injection.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
So the person administering

19:37.400 --> 19:39.400
the injection aims to inject the vaccine

19:39.400 --> 19:41.400
into a muscle but accidentally injects

19:41.400 --> 19:43.400
it into the bloodstream. And

19:43.400 --> 19:45.400
they recommend blood aspiration as a way

19:45.400 --> 19:47.400
to avoid this possibility. Now

19:47.400 --> 19:49.400
aspiration is the drawing back of the syringe

19:49.400 --> 19:51.400
plunger after insertion to

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
check if any blood flows back into the

19:53.400 --> 19:55.400
needle, basically. They recommend this

19:55.400 --> 19:57.400
as a way for the person administering the vaccine

19:57.400 --> 19:59.400
to make sure they're injecting in the right place.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.400
However, the World Health Organization

20:01.400 --> 20:03.400
and the Centers for Disease Control

20:03.400 --> 20:05.400
and Prevention do not recommend

20:05.400 --> 20:07.400
aspiration during the administration of the

20:07.400 --> 20:09.400
vaccine because the size of the needle

20:09.400 --> 20:11.400
and the size of the blood vessels at the site

20:11.400 --> 20:13.400
of injection mean that it's an unnecessary

20:13.400 --> 20:15.400
practice, they say. The CDC

20:15.400 --> 20:17.400
guidance on vaccine administration

20:17.400 --> 20:19.400
states that aspiration before

20:19.400 --> 20:21.400
injection of vaccines or toxoids

20:21.400 --> 20:23.400
is not necessary because no large

20:23.400 --> 20:25.400
blood vessels are present at the recommended

20:25.400 --> 20:27.400
injection sites. If this is

20:27.400 --> 20:29.400
true, it means that there is no way to

20:29.400 --> 20:31.400
accidentally replicate the sort

20:31.400 --> 20:33.400
of intentional intravenous injection

20:33.400 --> 20:35.400
seen in the experiment with the mice.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.400
So since they consider it unnecessary

20:37.400 --> 20:39.400
and it also leads to more painful

20:39.400 --> 20:41.400
injections, they recommend against

20:41.400 --> 20:43.400
it. Now it needs to be made very clear

20:43.400 --> 20:45.400
here that this study did not find evidence

20:45.400 --> 20:47.400
of accidental intravenous injections

20:47.400 --> 20:49.400
of any COVID-19 vaccine.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.400
That's not what the study was about.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.400
They treated it as a hypothetical possibility

20:53.400 --> 20:55.400
and then sought to investigate what would happen

20:55.400 --> 20:57.400
as a result. For evidence

20:57.400 --> 20:59.400
of the possibility of accidental

20:59.400 --> 21:01.400
intravenous injection, they point to a study

21:01.400 --> 21:03.400
called Blood Aspiration During

21:03.400 --> 21:05.400
IM Injection, a self-reporting

21:05.400 --> 21:07.400
study of nurses who were asked

21:07.400 --> 21:09.400
questions about blood aspiration.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.400
But I find this kind of tenuous.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.400
That study concerns all

21:13.400 --> 21:15.400
intramuscular medical injections,

21:15.400 --> 21:17.400
not just vaccine injections,

21:17.400 --> 21:19.400
in different parts of the body, not just

21:19.400 --> 21:21.400
where vaccines are usually administered,

21:21.400 --> 21:23.400
and it had an incredibly small

21:23.400 --> 21:25.400
sample size, being quote,

21:25.400 --> 21:27.400
limited to nurses in one small community

21:27.400 --> 21:29.400
hospital and one state university.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.400
The study did not survey all

21:31.400 --> 21:33.400
the nurses in these settings. As a

21:33.400 --> 21:35.400
result, the sample may not represent the

21:35.400 --> 21:37.400
population of nurses practicing and

21:37.400 --> 21:39.400
cannot be generalized. So what

21:39.400 --> 21:41.400
do we have here then? Well, we have

21:41.400 --> 21:43.400
one study arguing in favor of

21:43.400 --> 21:45.400
aspiration during vaccine injections

21:45.400 --> 21:47.400
versus the generally accepted guidelines

21:47.400 --> 21:49.400
stating that it's unnecessary.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.400
Phrasing this extremely generously

21:51.400 --> 21:53.400
to the authors of the study, we could say that

21:53.400 --> 21:55.400
some medical professionals recommend

21:55.400 --> 21:57.400
aspiration for vaccine injections

21:57.400 --> 21:59.400
and some don't. So how do we

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
get from here to Jimmy Dore stating

22:01.400 --> 22:03.400
outright that they're administering

22:03.400 --> 22:05.400
the jabs incorrectly?

22:05.400 --> 22:07.400
And now we find out they're administering

22:07.400 --> 22:09.400
the jabs incorrectly.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.400
Jimmy Dore

22:11.400 --> 22:13.400
has taken it upon himself to settle the

22:13.400 --> 22:15.400
argument here, and he's done it seemingly

22:15.400 --> 22:17.400
at random. He's picked the side that

22:17.400 --> 22:19.400
agrees with him, funnily enough,

22:19.400 --> 22:21.400
and said they're the ones who are correct

22:21.400 --> 22:23.400
here, based upon no evidence

22:23.400 --> 22:25.400
other than what he would like to be true

22:25.400 --> 22:27.400
it seems. Now it might shock

22:27.400 --> 22:29.400
you to hear this, but I disagree

22:29.400 --> 22:31.400
with Jimmy Dore here. By itself

22:31.400 --> 22:33.400
I don't find this study

22:33.400 --> 22:35.400
credible, but unlike Jimmy Dore

22:35.400 --> 22:37.400
I have an actual reason

22:37.400 --> 22:39.400
for thinking that. So this

22:39.400 --> 22:41.400
paper was linked on pubpia.com

22:41.400 --> 22:43.400
which is a website for discussion and

22:43.400 --> 22:45.400
review of scientific publications.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.400
And the top comment is from Elizabeth

22:47.400 --> 22:49.400
M. Bick. Now Elizabeth

22:49.400 --> 22:51.400
Bick has a Wikipedia page, and allow me

22:51.400 --> 22:53.400
to quote briefly from that.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.400
Elizabeth Bick is a Dutch microbiologist

22:55.400 --> 22:57.400
and scientific integrity consultant.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.400
Bick is known for her work detecting

22:59.400 --> 23:01.400
photo manipulation in scientific publications

23:01.400 --> 23:03.400
and identifying over 4,000

23:03.400 --> 23:05.400
potential cases of improper research

23:05.400 --> 23:07.400
conduct. So Elizabeth Bick

23:07.400 --> 23:09.400
and the other commenters on pubpia have some

23:09.400 --> 23:11.400
concerns about this paper.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.400
And allow me to relay a few of those.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.400
Firstly, there's some discussion about

23:15.400 --> 23:17.400
the amount of vaccine that the mice

23:17.400 --> 23:19.400
were administered, with Bick estimating

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
that the mice received a dose that was

23:21.400 --> 23:23.400
relative to their body weight between

23:23.400 --> 23:25.400
50 and 500 times the

23:25.400 --> 23:27.400
dose which is given to a human. However

23:27.400 --> 23:29.400
another comment points out that due to

23:29.400 --> 23:31.400
the metabolic differences between mice

23:31.400 --> 23:33.400
and humans, the relative difference in

23:33.400 --> 23:35.400
dosage wouldn't actually be that extreme.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.400
However they still estimate that it would

23:37.400 --> 23:39.400
be multiple times the dose given to a

23:39.400 --> 23:41.400
human. Now I don't know anything

23:41.400 --> 23:43.400
about the relative metabolic rates

23:43.400 --> 23:45.400
of mice and men, I'm afraid.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.400
So I'm gonna call this one a wash.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.400
You know, it's a possible overdose. But I can't

23:49.400 --> 23:51.400
say conclusively because I just don't

23:51.400 --> 23:53.400
know. I have no way to fairly

23:53.400 --> 23:55.400
decide one way or the other here.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.400
So next up, and more conclusively,

23:57.400 --> 23:59.400
the commenters claim the strain of

23:59.400 --> 24:01.400
lab mice that were used in the study are

24:01.400 --> 24:03.400
apparently prone to the sort of heart problems

24:03.400 --> 24:05.400
that the study was looking for. And I quote

24:05.400 --> 24:07.400
Pericardial fibrosis and

24:07.400 --> 24:09.400
mineralization is a common background

24:09.400 --> 24:11.400
finding in healthy Balb C

24:11.400 --> 24:13.400
mice, as any pathologist with mouse

24:13.400 --> 24:15.400
experience can attest.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.400
The lesions shown in figures 1 and 2

24:17.400 --> 24:19.400
show pericardial fibrosis and

24:19.400 --> 24:21.400
calcification 1 or 2 days

24:21.400 --> 24:23.400
after vaccination, which seems incredibly

24:23.400 --> 24:25.400
fast. It usually takes 5

24:25.400 --> 24:27.400
days to see this extent of fibrosis.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.400
And other commenters chimed

24:29.400 --> 24:31.400
in supporting these claims, with one

24:31.400 --> 24:33.400
stating, this paper reports what appears

24:33.400 --> 24:35.400
to be naturally occurring pericardial

24:35.400 --> 24:37.400
lesions in Balb C mice.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.400
It's essentially impossible to get such

24:39.400 --> 24:41.400
advanced lesions in 1-2 days

24:41.400 --> 24:43.400
post-injection. Now, if this

24:43.400 --> 24:45.400
were true, if this study really is

24:45.400 --> 24:47.400
just showing what were already existing

24:47.400 --> 24:49.400
heart issues in these mice,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.400
why is the study reporting that they were found

24:51.400 --> 24:53.400
more often in the intravenous

24:53.400 --> 24:55.400
group? What a mystery

24:55.400 --> 24:57.400
we have here. Well, let's attempt to solve

24:57.400 --> 24:59.400
it. And we'll start with a very basic

24:59.400 --> 25:01.400
hypothesis.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.400
What if the authors of this study

25:03.400 --> 25:05.400
just mixed the mice up?

25:05.400 --> 25:07.400
You know, what if it was that simple?

25:07.400 --> 25:09.400
So, let's investigate, if

25:09.400 --> 25:11.400
only to disprove this hypothesis.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.400
Now, this study includes lots

25:13.400 --> 25:15.400
of pictures of dead and dissected

25:15.400 --> 25:17.400
mice, which do not worry, I will not

25:17.400 --> 25:19.400
be showing here. What I will

25:19.400 --> 25:21.400
be showing is scans of their heart

25:21.400 --> 25:23.400
tissue, such as this one, figure

25:23.400 --> 25:25.400
2, which shows, quote, blue

25:25.400 --> 25:27.400
stained thickened visceral pericardium

25:27.400 --> 25:29.400
over the right atrium and

25:29.400 --> 25:31.400
ventricle at 1 dpi of IV

25:31.400 --> 25:33.400
vaccine, which became more prominent

25:33.400 --> 25:35.400
at 2 dpi, that's days

25:35.400 --> 25:37.400
post-injection there. So,

25:37.400 --> 25:39.400
this scan in figure 2a shows a

25:39.400 --> 25:41.400
heart from the group which was given the intravenous

25:41.400 --> 25:43.400
mRNA vaccine, and

25:43.400 --> 25:45.400
the authors identify what they say are

25:45.400 --> 25:47.400
problems with it. So, let's take

25:47.400 --> 25:49.400
a look at how this compares to a scan of a

25:49.400 --> 25:51.400
heart from the group of mice who were given the

25:51.400 --> 25:53.400
intramuscular injection.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.400
So, this is figure 5, from the section

25:55.400 --> 25:57.400
titled, IM mRNA Vaccine

25:57.400 --> 25:59.400
Administration Only Induced Mild

25:59.400 --> 26:01.400
Myocardial Congestion and

26:01.400 --> 26:03.400
Edema. And this particular scan

26:03.400 --> 26:05.400
in figure 5c is from a mouse

26:05.400 --> 26:07.400
who received an IM injection

26:07.400 --> 26:09.400
instead of an IV injection

26:09.400 --> 26:11.400
and thus has fewer heart problems

26:11.400 --> 26:13.400
apparently. And let's take a look at these

26:13.400 --> 26:15.400
side by side. So, IV

26:15.400 --> 26:17.400
mouse on the left, IM

26:17.400 --> 26:19.400
mouse on the right. Except,

26:19.400 --> 26:21.400
and I've always wanted to

26:21.400 --> 26:23.400
do this, computer

26:23.400 --> 26:25.400
enhance, rotate

26:25.400 --> 26:27.400
right image 115 degrees,

26:27.400 --> 26:29.400
combine.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.400
And, would you look at that,

26:31.400 --> 26:33.400
this is the same image

26:33.400 --> 26:35.400
right here. These heart scans are cited

26:35.400 --> 26:37.400
both to show the damage caused by

26:37.400 --> 26:39.400
intravenous injection and

26:39.400 --> 26:41.400
the relative lack of damage caused by

26:41.400 --> 26:43.400
intramuscular injection, but it's

26:43.400 --> 26:45.400
the same scan. This is the

26:45.400 --> 26:47.400
same mouse. So,

26:47.400 --> 26:49.400
what happened here then? Well,

26:49.400 --> 26:51.400
to put it in scientific terms,

26:51.400 --> 26:53.400
they balled it up. This

26:53.400 --> 26:55.400
same sample is marked both IV

26:55.400 --> 26:57.400
vaccine 2dpi and

26:57.400 --> 26:59.400
IM vaccine 2dpi,

26:59.400 --> 27:01.400
which were the two groups the study was

27:01.400 --> 27:03.400
seeking to compare. So, they've

27:03.400 --> 27:05.400
mixed something up somewhere, clearly.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.400
And props to Elizabeth Bick and

27:07.400 --> 27:09.400
the commenters over at Pubpia for

27:09.400 --> 27:11.400
spotting this, of course. Now, what

27:11.400 --> 27:13.400
this means is that the results of this

27:13.400 --> 27:15.400
study are suspect now.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.400
How many other samples did the authors

27:17.400 --> 27:19.400
of this study accidentally put in the wrong

27:19.400 --> 27:21.400
groups? I don't know,

27:21.400 --> 27:23.400
and nor does John Campbell or

27:23.400 --> 27:25.400
Jimmy Dore. All we can conclusively

27:25.400 --> 27:27.400
learn from this study is that the study should

27:27.400 --> 27:29.400
probably be performed again.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.400
Now, to be fair, you might argue

27:31.400 --> 27:33.400
that maybe I'm overplaying this

27:33.400 --> 27:35.400
one mistake. After all, it is

27:35.400 --> 27:37.400
only one mistake, and

27:37.400 --> 27:39.400
another counterargument could be that the

27:39.400 --> 27:41.400
strain of mouse doesn't matter too much either,

27:41.400 --> 27:43.400
even if they are prone to heart

27:43.400 --> 27:45.400
problems, because with a large enough sample

27:45.400 --> 27:47.400
size, those problems and

27:47.400 --> 27:49.400
the occasional mistake wouldn't

27:49.400 --> 27:51.400
impact the overall data

27:51.400 --> 27:53.400
too much. It would all come out in

27:53.400 --> 27:55.400
the wash. So, what

27:55.400 --> 27:57.400
sort of group sizes are we

27:57.400 --> 27:59.400
looking at with these mice? Well,

27:59.400 --> 28:01.400
six

28:01.400 --> 28:03.400
mice, for instance, in the

28:03.400 --> 28:05.400
2DPI-IM group.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.400
So, and this is something

28:07.400 --> 28:09.400
important to remember beyond this one study

28:09.400 --> 28:11.400
by the way, if you ever hear that

28:11.400 --> 28:13.400
this or that was found in 50%

28:13.400 --> 28:15.400
of tested mice, that

28:15.400 --> 28:17.400
could be only three mice,

28:17.400 --> 28:19.400
one of which in this particular study

28:19.400 --> 28:21.400
ended up in the wrong group somehow.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.400
What we're seeing here is bad science

28:23.400 --> 28:25.400
getting picked up and repeated by

28:25.400 --> 28:27.400
anti-vaccine propagandists.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.400
Jimmy Dore and John Campbell

28:29.400 --> 28:31.400
between them have 2 million YouTube

28:31.400 --> 28:33.400
subscribers, and their videos using

28:33.400 --> 28:35.400
this study to claim vaccines are being

28:35.400 --> 28:37.400
administered incorrectly have hundreds

28:37.400 --> 28:39.400
of thousands of views. And

28:39.400 --> 28:41.400
a lot of those viewers are gonna go away, and all

28:41.400 --> 28:43.400
they'll remember and possibly repeat to

28:43.400 --> 28:45.400
other people is, well, I saw a video

28:45.400 --> 28:47.400
about a study that said vaccines

28:47.400 --> 28:49.400
damage your heart. Pointing out

28:49.400 --> 28:51.400
the fact that there were major problems with the

28:51.400 --> 28:53.400
study is all well and good, but it feels

28:53.400 --> 28:55.400
like the damage has already been done at this

28:55.400 --> 28:57.400
point. Now, just to be clear

28:57.400 --> 28:59.400
here, this study is rubbish,

28:59.400 --> 29:01.400
but I don't mean to give the impression

29:01.400 --> 29:03.400
that an accidental intravenous injection

29:03.400 --> 29:05.400
is completely impossible.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.400
Of course, as with all medical procedures,

29:07.400 --> 29:09.400
mistakes can and do happen.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.400
And with millions of

29:11.400 --> 29:13.400
vaccinations being carried out, it would be unreasonable

29:13.400 --> 29:15.400
to assume that no mistakes occur

29:15.400 --> 29:17.400
anywhere. And if some more

29:17.400 --> 29:19.400
rigorous studies than this one led to a change

29:19.400 --> 29:21.400
in the way the medical community at large

29:21.400 --> 29:23.400
administers vaccines, I would have

29:23.400 --> 29:25.400
no criticism of that. And

29:25.400 --> 29:27.400
if further, even more rigorous

29:27.400 --> 29:29.400
studies were then carried out and the medical

29:29.400 --> 29:31.400
community changed back to the current

29:31.400 --> 29:33.400
way of administering vaccines, I'd

29:33.400 --> 29:35.400
have no criticism of that either.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.400
Medical science, like all

29:37.400 --> 29:39.400
science, changes and updates

29:39.400 --> 29:41.400
as we learn new information. It's not

29:41.400 --> 29:43.400
some hypocrisy, it's not some

29:43.400 --> 29:45.400
trick being played on us, it's just

29:45.400 --> 29:47.400
the way science happens.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.400
Anyway, let's move on and look at another

29:49.400 --> 29:51.400
video. So this is

29:51.400 --> 29:53.400
Vax Side Effect, Sudden Hearing

29:53.400 --> 29:55.400
Loss Reported. And here, Jimmy

29:55.400 --> 29:57.400
Dore falls into that most classic

29:57.400 --> 29:59.400
of argumentative pitfalls,

29:59.400 --> 30:01.400
the correlation versus causation

30:01.400 --> 30:03.400
misunderstanding. So, the

30:03.400 --> 30:05.400
portion of this video that is actually about

30:05.400 --> 30:07.400
hearing loss is mostly just Dore

30:07.400 --> 30:09.400
watching a news report from ABC15

30:09.400 --> 30:11.400
about some people who reported

30:11.400 --> 30:13.400
experiencing tinnitus after being

30:13.400 --> 30:15.400
vaccinated against COVID-19.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.400
A lot of Dore's videos

30:17.400 --> 30:19.400
consist of him just watching other

30:19.400 --> 30:21.400
videos and making faces at them actually.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.400
Now then, we need

30:45.400 --> 30:47.400
to be careful and responsible

30:47.400 --> 30:49.400
when investigating and reporting

30:49.400 --> 30:51.400
this sort of thing. You see,

30:51.400 --> 30:53.400
the issue here is one of scale.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.400
It might be that you can find

30:55.400 --> 30:57.400
217 people in

30:57.400 --> 30:59.400
Arizona, say, who reported

30:59.400 --> 31:01.400
tinnitus after being vaccinated.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.400
But Arizona has a population

31:03.400 --> 31:05.400
of millions of people,

31:05.400 --> 31:07.400
and if an area's healthcare system

31:07.400 --> 31:09.400
vaccinates millions of people, that

31:09.400 --> 31:11.400
is a huge data set to pull from.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.400
And tinnitus can have several possible

31:13.400 --> 31:15.400
causes. Sinus congestion,

31:15.400 --> 31:17.400
stress, anxiety,

31:17.400 --> 31:19.400
high blood pressure, and so on.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.400
Out of millions of people,

31:21.400 --> 31:23.400
we'd expect some of those people

31:23.400 --> 31:25.400
to report tinnitus anyway

31:25.400 --> 31:27.400
on just an average week with no

31:27.400 --> 31:29.400
vaccinations whatsoever.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.400
So, this could just be a coincidence,

31:31.400 --> 31:33.400
right? They could be incorrectly

31:33.400 --> 31:35.400
identifying the cause of their

31:35.400 --> 31:37.400
tinnitus as the recent vaccination

31:37.400 --> 31:39.400
due to nothing more than unfortunate

31:39.400 --> 31:41.400
timing. And let's do

31:41.400 --> 31:43.400
a thought experiment here.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.400
Let's imagine that millions of people

31:45.400 --> 31:47.400
in a country are asked to go to a medical

31:47.400 --> 31:49.400
facility and have a doctor or nurse

31:49.400 --> 31:51.400
click their fingers in front

31:51.400 --> 31:53.400
of that person's face.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.400
That's all, then they leave and go

31:55.400 --> 31:57.400
about their lives. So, the

31:57.400 --> 31:59.400
basic framework of how we're currently

31:59.400 --> 32:01.400
vaccinating people only without the

32:01.400 --> 32:03.400
vaccinations, just a finger click.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.400
Now, of those millions

32:05.400 --> 32:07.400
of people, some of them will

32:07.400 --> 32:09.400
develop tinnitus in the following week.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.400
Some of them will experience

32:11.400 --> 32:13.400
headaches, some of them will have a

32:13.400 --> 32:15.400
heart attack or a stroke, and some

32:15.400 --> 32:17.400
of them will die. But none of

32:17.400 --> 32:19.400
that will have anything at all to do with

32:19.400 --> 32:21.400
the finger click. It would be a coincidence.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.400
Because we have millions of people

32:23.400 --> 32:25.400
experiencing an event, we have

32:25.400 --> 32:27.400
millions of chances for tinnitus

32:27.400 --> 32:29.400
and headaches and heart attacks

32:29.400 --> 32:31.400
to happen. But people, as a rule,

32:31.400 --> 32:33.400
aren't very good at thinking in terms

32:33.400 --> 32:35.400
of very large numbers. You'd

32:35.400 --> 32:37.400
only need a dozen or so people having

32:37.400 --> 32:39.400
heart attacks within a week of the finger click

32:39.400 --> 32:41.400
to build an alarmist narrative about

32:41.400 --> 32:43.400
finger clicks causing heart attacks

32:43.400 --> 32:45.400
or whatever. But they wouldn't,

32:45.400 --> 32:47.400
of course, it would be entirely coincidental.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.400
What you would need to start

32:49.400 --> 32:51.400
to prove a link between finger clicks and

32:51.400 --> 32:53.400
heart attacks is an elevated

32:53.400 --> 32:55.400
number of heart attacks relative to

32:55.400 --> 32:57.400
what we would usually expect.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.400
By itself, any one case

32:59.400 --> 33:01.400
is just anecdotal evidence.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.400
For instance, Nicki Minaj's cousin's

33:03.400 --> 33:05.400
friend says his testicles swelled

33:05.400 --> 33:07.400
up after getting vaccinated.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.400
Does that anecdotal evidence

33:09.400 --> 33:11.400
prove that vaccines make your

33:11.400 --> 33:13.400
testicles swell? No,

33:13.400 --> 33:15.400
it doesn't. By themselves, Nicki

33:15.400 --> 33:17.400
Minaj's cousin's friend's giant

33:17.400 --> 33:19.400
balls can't tell us anything about the

33:19.400 --> 33:21.400
COVID-19 vaccine. When

33:21.400 --> 33:23.400
reporting things like this, it's better to

33:23.400 --> 33:25.400
cite actual medical studies looking

33:25.400 --> 33:27.400
for a direct link between vaccines

33:27.400 --> 33:29.400
and various symptoms instead

33:29.400 --> 33:31.400
of relying on individual anecdotal

33:31.400 --> 33:33.400
evidence. It's also not good

33:33.400 --> 33:35.400
to put that anecdotal evidence in a video

33:35.400 --> 33:37.400
titled, Vax Side Effect

33:37.400 --> 33:39.400
as if it's already been settled.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.400
Now, I'm sure that right now you're

33:41.400 --> 33:43.400
all saying, hold up there, Sean.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.400
COVID-19, as a

33:45.400 --> 33:47.400
respiratory illness, can cause sinus

33:47.400 --> 33:49.400
problems and therefore tinnitus.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.400
And it does so at much higher rates than

33:51.400 --> 33:53.400
among those who reported tinnitus after

33:53.400 --> 33:55.400
being vaccinated. And this is especially

33:55.400 --> 33:57.400
true of the Delta variant, which has been

33:57.400 --> 33:59.400
shown to more greatly affect the upper

33:59.400 --> 34:01.400
respiratory tract. So this is all moot,

34:01.400 --> 34:03.400
right? If you want to avoid getting

34:03.400 --> 34:05.400
tinnitus, it's still better to be

34:05.400 --> 34:07.400
vaccinated than not. And you're

34:07.400 --> 34:09.400
right to say all that. Well done.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.400
A few anecdotal cases of

34:11.400 --> 34:13.400
tinnitus not proven to be linked to the

34:13.400 --> 34:15.400
vaccine is no argument whatsoever

34:15.400 --> 34:17.400
against the vaccine. It does

34:17.400 --> 34:19.400
not stand up to scrutiny.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.400
But here's where we need to talk about the way in

34:21.400 --> 34:23.400
which conspiracy theories are delivered

34:23.400 --> 34:25.400
from the conspiracy theorist

34:25.400 --> 34:27.400
to their audience, which is what is

34:27.400 --> 34:29.400
happening here. Because the issue

34:29.400 --> 34:31.400
is that this video is not supposed

34:31.400 --> 34:33.400
to stand up to scrutiny.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.400
None of these videos are supposed to

34:35.400 --> 34:37.400
stand up to scrutiny. They're all

34:37.400 --> 34:39.400
meant to be only a single piece of evidence

34:39.400 --> 34:41.400
in this. An

34:41.400 --> 34:43.400
overwhelming barrage of

34:43.400 --> 34:45.400
relentless sort of evidence.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.400
It doesn't matter if you

34:47.400 --> 34:49.400
disprove one piece of evidence

34:49.400 --> 34:51.400
because there's just so much of it

34:51.400 --> 34:53.400
and all of it comes with plausible

34:53.400 --> 34:55.400
deniability. Jimmy Dawes

34:55.400 --> 34:57.400
grift works by producing an extremely

34:57.400 --> 34:59.400
large amount of air quotes

34:59.400 --> 35:01.400
evidence. None of which, when

35:01.400 --> 35:03.400
examined closely, will stand up.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.400
But taken together, it gives

35:05.400 --> 35:07.400
the impression that there must be

35:07.400 --> 35:09.400
some sort of point here, right?

35:09.400 --> 35:11.400
This is the quantity, not

35:11.400 --> 35:13.400
quality style of argument.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.400
If you don't like one argument, I've

35:15.400 --> 35:17.400
got another. And if you don't like that

35:17.400 --> 35:19.400
argument, I've got another. And

35:19.400 --> 35:21.400
so on and so forth until you just

35:21.400 --> 35:23.400
run out of energy to refute all of

35:23.400 --> 35:25.400
this. And if you ever do manage to

35:25.400 --> 35:27.400
pin the conspiracy theorist down on one

35:27.400 --> 35:29.400
particular irrefutable point,

35:29.400 --> 35:31.400
they'll just lie and claim they

35:31.400 --> 35:33.400
never said what they said. Like

35:33.400 --> 35:35.400
we saw Jimmy Dawe do with his statements

35:35.400 --> 35:37.400
about ivermectin. And

35:37.400 --> 35:39.400
unfortunately, one result of anti-vaccine

35:39.400 --> 35:41.400
propaganda like this is that misled

35:41.400 --> 35:43.400
people end up getting seriously

35:43.400 --> 35:45.400
sick and possibly dying.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.400
And here, I'd like to be careful

35:47.400 --> 35:49.400
to make a distinction between anti-vaccine

35:49.400 --> 35:51.400
propagandists and people who

35:51.400 --> 35:53.400
I guess we call vaccine-hesitant.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.400
The majority of vaccinated people

35:55.400 --> 35:57.400
fall into the vaccine-hesitant camp.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.400
They aren't committed to opposing

35:59.400 --> 36:01.400
vaccines, they just aren't sure

36:01.400 --> 36:03.400
what is the safest course of action.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.400
Of course, the safest course of action

36:05.400 --> 36:07.400
is to be vaccinated, and the

36:07.400 --> 36:09.400
vaccine-hesitant have undoubtedly heard

36:09.400 --> 36:11.400
a lot of positive things about vaccines,

36:11.400 --> 36:13.400
but they've also probably heard a fair

36:13.400 --> 36:15.400
few vaccine lies, like those given

36:15.400 --> 36:17.400
a platform by people like Jimmy Dawe.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.400
Now, Dawe himself isn't even

36:19.400 --> 36:21.400
pushing anti-vaccine conspiracies

36:21.400 --> 36:23.400
for ideological reasons, I don't think.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.400
I don't think he actually has any

36:25.400 --> 36:27.400
opinions, to be honest. He's just someone

36:27.400 --> 36:29.400
who's willing to cash in on a trend,

36:29.400 --> 36:31.400
even if it ends up getting people killed.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.400
Anyway, one way the vaccine-

36:33.400 --> 36:35.400
hesitant group is targeted by

36:35.400 --> 36:37.400
the propagandists is by exploiting

36:37.400 --> 36:39.400
a distrust of authority.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.400
Vaccine-hesitant people might not have

36:41.400 --> 36:43.400
much trust in the political system in which

36:43.400 --> 36:45.400
they live, and that can be for very

36:45.400 --> 36:47.400
valid reasons. Beyond the usual

36:47.400 --> 36:49.400
reasons to distrust people in power,

36:49.400 --> 36:51.400
with regards to the pandemic, we've

36:51.400 --> 36:53.400
seen them giving inaccurate or contradictory

36:53.400 --> 36:55.400
medical advice, making

36:55.400 --> 36:57.400
promises they can't keep, not

36:57.400 --> 36:59.400
following their own lockdown regulations,

36:59.400 --> 37:01.400
and so on. There is a lot

37:01.400 --> 37:03.400
to criticize there. And there's also

37:03.400 --> 37:05.400
a lot to criticize the pharmaceutical

37:05.400 --> 37:07.400
industry for, and this is particularly

37:07.400 --> 37:09.400
true in the United States, where there is

37:09.400 --> 37:11.400
an entirely understandable skepticism

37:11.400 --> 37:13.400
of their for-profit healthcare

37:13.400 --> 37:15.400
system. So it's easy for the

37:15.400 --> 37:17.400
propagandists to point to all this hypocrisy,

37:17.400 --> 37:19.400
corruption, and incompetence,

37:19.400 --> 37:21.400
and then try to marry that

37:21.400 --> 37:23.400
to the science of vaccination.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.400
See, these powerful people

37:25.400 --> 37:27.400
are clueless, and corrupt, and

37:27.400 --> 37:29.400
untrustworthy, and they're telling

37:29.400 --> 37:31.400
you to get vaccinated. So the

37:31.400 --> 37:33.400
conclusion, either spoken directly

37:33.400 --> 37:35.400
or left implied, is that

37:35.400 --> 37:37.400
vaccination must therefore be

37:37.400 --> 37:39.400
equally suspect.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.400
America's doctor, Sanjay Gupta, asks

37:41.400 --> 37:43.400
Anthony Fauci

37:43.400 --> 37:45.400
about this exact

37:45.400 --> 37:47.400
study, and whether he's considered

37:47.400 --> 37:49.400
natural immunity as a

37:49.400 --> 37:51.400
factor, and Fauci said, no, I haven't

37:51.400 --> 37:53.400
really thought about that.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.400
There was a study that came out of Israel about

37:55.400 --> 37:57.400
natural immunity, and basically

37:57.400 --> 37:59.400
the headline was that natural immunity

37:59.400 --> 38:01.400
provides a lot of protection, even

38:01.400 --> 38:03.400
better than the vaccines alone.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.400
What are

38:05.400 --> 38:07.400
people to make of that? So

38:07.400 --> 38:09.400
as we talk about vaccine mandates,

38:09.400 --> 38:11.400
I get calls all the time, people say, I've

38:11.400 --> 38:13.400
already had COVID, I'm

38:13.400 --> 38:15.400
protected, and now the study says, maybe

38:15.400 --> 38:17.400
even more protected than the vaccine alone.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.400
Should they also get the vaccine?

38:19.400 --> 38:21.400
How do you make the case to them?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.400
You know, that's a really

38:23.400 --> 38:25.400
good point, Sanjay. I don't have a really

38:25.400 --> 38:27.400
firm answer for you on that.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.400
Which is absolutely absurd

38:29.400 --> 38:31.400
that someone of Fauci's acumen

38:31.400 --> 38:33.400
with his expertise would not

38:33.400 --> 38:35.400
have considered this, and it really

38:35.400 --> 38:37.400
is further evidence that he

38:37.400 --> 38:39.400
will only consider

38:39.400 --> 38:41.400
a big pharma-directed

38:41.400 --> 38:43.400
solution, if we can even call it

38:43.400 --> 38:45.400
a solution.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.400
Because he's not that much

38:47.400 --> 38:49.400
of a hack, he's not that stupid, he knows

38:49.400 --> 38:51.400
exactly what he's doing, and they

38:51.400 --> 38:53.400
don't want to consider this

38:53.400 --> 38:55.400
because it destroys

38:55.400 --> 38:57.400
the big pharma agenda.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.400
So that was journalist

38:59.400 --> 39:01.400
Max Blumenfall there, talking to

39:01.400 --> 39:03.400
Jimmy Dore in the video, Fauci

39:03.400 --> 39:05.400
has no answer why vax people

39:05.400 --> 39:07.400
with natural immunity, which

39:07.400 --> 39:09.400
appears to show the medical advisor to the

39:09.400 --> 39:11.400
president, Dr. Anthony Fauci, having

39:11.400 --> 39:13.400
no answer to why people who have had

39:13.400 --> 39:15.400
COVID before and recovered should

39:15.400 --> 39:17.400
still get vaccinated. And Blumenfall

39:17.400 --> 39:19.400
makes the case that this is a profit

39:19.400 --> 39:21.400
motivated decision on behalf of

39:21.400 --> 39:23.400
big pharma to sell more vaccines

39:23.400 --> 39:25.400
or something. Except, that

39:25.400 --> 39:27.400
clip was cut a little oddly there,

39:27.400 --> 39:29.400
I'm sure you noticed. You see,

39:29.400 --> 39:31.400
Fauci says he doesn't have a firm answer,

39:31.400 --> 39:33.400
but then he does keep talking and

39:33.400 --> 39:35.400
gives an answer to the question.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.400
You know, that's a really good point, Sanjay.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.400
I don't have a really firm answer for you

39:39.400 --> 39:41.400
on that. That's something that we're

39:41.400 --> 39:43.400
going to have to discuss regarding

39:43.400 --> 39:45.400
the durability of the response. The one thing

39:45.400 --> 39:47.400
the paper from Israel didn't

39:47.400 --> 39:49.400
tell you is whether or not as high

39:49.400 --> 39:51.400
as the protection is with

39:51.400 --> 39:53.400
natural infection, what's the durability

39:53.400 --> 39:55.400
compared to the durability

39:55.400 --> 39:57.400
of a vaccine. So it is conceivable

39:57.400 --> 39:59.400
that you got infected, you're protected,

39:59.400 --> 40:01.400
but you may not be protected for an

40:01.400 --> 40:03.400
indefinite period of time. So

40:03.400 --> 40:05.400
one reason that people who have had COVID before

40:05.400 --> 40:07.400
should still get vaccinated, Fauci

40:07.400 --> 40:09.400
argues, is because we aren't yet sure about

40:09.400 --> 40:11.400
the length of time immunity resulting

40:11.400 --> 40:13.400
from an infection of COVID might last.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.400
So in that case, it's still better

40:15.400 --> 40:17.400
to also get the vaccine just

40:17.400 --> 40:19.400
to be safe. Daw and Blumenfall

40:19.400 --> 40:21.400
used this one instance of Fauci

40:21.400 --> 40:23.400
saying he doesn't have a firm answer to

40:23.400 --> 40:25.400
imply that there are no firm answers to

40:25.400 --> 40:27.400
this question, beyond the greed of

40:27.400 --> 40:29.400
the pharmaceutical industry. But this

40:29.400 --> 40:31.400
is not the case. There are answers

40:31.400 --> 40:33.400
to this question, regardless of what

40:33.400 --> 40:35.400
Fauci said in an interview one time.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.400
You know, are they actually interested

40:37.400 --> 40:39.400
in answering this question, or are they

40:39.400 --> 40:41.400
just trying to make Fauci look silly?

40:41.400 --> 40:43.400
So let's have a think about this

40:43.400 --> 40:45.400
question. Blumenfall and Daw

40:45.400 --> 40:47.400
make the case that a study came out

40:47.400 --> 40:49.400
that says so-called natural immunity

40:49.400 --> 40:51.400
is better than vaccine immunity, so

40:51.400 --> 40:53.400
why should people who have so-called

40:53.400 --> 40:55.400
natural immunity still get the vaccine?

40:55.400 --> 40:57.400
You know, beyond the one reason

40:57.400 --> 40:59.400
that we've already seen, that we aren't sure

40:59.400 --> 41:01.400
how long this immunity lasts.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.400
Now firstly, I'd answer, there

41:03.400 --> 41:05.400
are undoubtedly a lot of people out there

41:05.400 --> 41:07.400
who think that they already caught

41:07.400 --> 41:09.400
COVID-19, but haven't.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.400
If someone you're in close contact with

41:11.400 --> 41:13.400
catches it and then you feel sick around

41:13.400 --> 41:15.400
the same time, you might just assume

41:15.400 --> 41:17.400
you have it too and not bother to get tested.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.400
But some of those cases are going

41:19.400 --> 41:21.400
to be colds, flus,

41:21.400 --> 41:23.400
or other illnesses. People who have

41:23.400 --> 41:25.400
misdiagnosed themselves with COVID-19

41:25.400 --> 41:27.400
and they're unknowingly

41:27.400 --> 41:29.400
walking around today with no

41:29.400 --> 41:31.400
immunity, air quotes, natural

41:31.400 --> 41:33.400
or otherwise. Secondly,

41:33.400 --> 41:35.400
tests for COVID can give

41:35.400 --> 41:37.400
false positives. There are also

41:37.400 --> 41:39.400
undoubtedly a lot of people walking around

41:39.400 --> 41:41.400
today who assume they've had COVID

41:41.400 --> 41:43.400
because they tested for it and received

41:43.400 --> 41:45.400
a false positive result.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.400
Relative to the whole population, this won't

41:47.400 --> 41:49.400
be many people, but it will still be a

41:49.400 --> 41:51.400
significant amount. Thirdly,

41:51.400 --> 41:53.400
the study mentioned in Blumenfall and Daw's

41:53.400 --> 41:55.400
video, the one they used to argue that

41:55.400 --> 41:57.400
immunity from catching COVID is better

41:57.400 --> 41:59.400
than vaccine immunity might

41:59.400 --> 42:01.400
be wrong. Blumenfall

42:01.400 --> 42:03.400
mentions in the video that he tweeted

42:03.400 --> 42:05.400
about the article, so I went and

42:05.400 --> 42:07.400
found it, and here it is.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.400
Bombshell preprint study of

42:09.400 --> 42:11.400
76,000 COVID subjects demonstrated

42:11.400 --> 42:13.400
that natural immunity,

42:13.400 --> 42:15.400
so on and so forth. Now, what you might notice

42:15.400 --> 42:17.400
here is the word preprint.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.400
The study mentioned is comparing

42:19.400 --> 42:21.400
SARS-CoV-2 natural

42:21.400 --> 42:23.400
immunity to vaccine-induced immunity,

42:23.400 --> 42:25.400
re-infections versus breakthrough

42:25.400 --> 42:27.400
infections, and if we go to where the study's

42:27.400 --> 42:29.400
hosted, right underneath the title it

42:29.400 --> 42:31.400
says, this article is a preprint

42:31.400 --> 42:33.400
and has not been peer reviewed.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.400
It reports new medical research

42:35.400 --> 42:37.400
that has yet to be evaluated and

42:37.400 --> 42:39.400
so should not be used to guide clinical

42:39.400 --> 42:41.400
practice. And if we click on that

42:41.400 --> 42:43.400
what does this mean link, we get a page

42:43.400 --> 42:45.400
explaining that preprint studies quote

42:45.400 --> 42:47.400
have yet to be evaluated by the medical

42:47.400 --> 42:49.400
community and the information presented

42:49.400 --> 42:51.400
may be erroneous. So this

42:51.400 --> 42:53.400
study compares individuals from

42:53.400 --> 42:55.400
three groups. Those who have had COVID

42:55.400 --> 42:57.400
and recovered from it but are not vaccinated,

42:57.400 --> 42:59.400
those who have had COVID and recovered

42:59.400 --> 43:01.400
from it and are vaccinated,

43:01.400 --> 43:03.400
and those who have just been vaccinated.

43:03.400 --> 43:05.400
And its findings,

43:05.400 --> 43:07.400
remember its early preprint

43:07.400 --> 43:09.400
not peer reviewed findings,

43:09.400 --> 43:11.400
are that so-called natural immunity

43:11.400 --> 43:13.400
is better than vaccine immunity

43:13.400 --> 43:15.400
alone. They come to this conclusion

43:15.400 --> 43:17.400
because they find more breakthrough cases

43:17.400 --> 43:19.400
reported from COVID tests in the vaccinated

43:19.400 --> 43:21.400
group than in the natural immunity

43:21.400 --> 43:23.400
group. So let's talk about a few

43:23.400 --> 43:25.400
ways a study like this might

43:25.400 --> 43:27.400
come to some incorrect or exaggerated

43:27.400 --> 43:29.400
conclusions.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.400
Firstly there's the usual limitations.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.400
It only concerns one

43:33.400 --> 43:35.400
type of vaccine, it only concerns

43:35.400 --> 43:37.400
the delta variant of COVID

43:37.400 --> 43:39.400
and so on. But I want to think about possible

43:39.400 --> 43:41.400
differences in behavior between

43:41.400 --> 43:43.400
the groups that were compared.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.400
As the study itself says, our

43:45.400 --> 43:47.400
results might be affected by differences

43:47.400 --> 43:49.400
between the groups in terms of health behaviors

43:49.400 --> 43:51.400
such as social distancing

43:51.400 --> 43:53.400
and mask wearing, a possible

43:53.400 --> 43:55.400
confounder that was not assessed.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.400
And another health behavior that might

43:57.400 --> 43:59.400
bias the findings of a study like this

43:59.400 --> 44:01.400
is willingness to get retested

44:01.400 --> 44:03.400
for COVID. Because this

44:03.400 --> 44:05.400
study is reporting results largely

44:05.400 --> 44:07.400
from voluntary tests

44:07.400 --> 44:09.400
for COVID. It's possible that

44:09.400 --> 44:11.400
individuals who are vaccinated are

44:11.400 --> 44:13.400
more conscious of the public health,

44:13.400 --> 44:15.400
more personally concerned about

44:15.400 --> 44:17.400
catching COVID and passing it on

44:17.400 --> 44:19.400
and thus are more likely to get tested

44:19.400 --> 44:21.400
in the first place. Maybe people

44:21.400 --> 44:23.400
who have had COVID once and not bothered

44:23.400 --> 44:25.400
to get vaccinated are more likely

44:25.400 --> 44:27.400
to think that they don't have to bother

44:27.400 --> 44:29.400
with retesting for COVID either

44:29.400 --> 44:31.400
since they've already had it. A lot of

44:31.400 --> 44:33.400
asymptomatic or mild cases

44:33.400 --> 44:35.400
of COVID might therefore be being missed

44:35.400 --> 44:37.400
in one group but picked up in the

44:37.400 --> 44:39.400
other. And the study itself comments

44:39.400 --> 44:41.400
on the possibility of missing asymptomatic

44:41.400 --> 44:43.400
infections saying

44:43.400 --> 44:45.400
Additionally, as this is an observational

44:45.400 --> 44:47.400
real world study where PCR

44:47.400 --> 44:49.400
screening was not performed by protocol,

44:49.400 --> 44:51.400
we might be underestimating

44:51.400 --> 44:53.400
asymptomatic infections as these

44:53.400 --> 44:55.400
individuals often do not get tested.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.400
Also, if we attempt

44:57.400 --> 44:59.400
to use this study to dissuade

44:59.400 --> 45:01.400
vaccination, we commit a different

45:01.400 --> 45:03.400
type of sampling error.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.400
Because in terms of whether or not you should get

45:05.400 --> 45:07.400
vaccinated, the groups being compared

45:07.400 --> 45:09.400
by the study are not fit for purpose.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.400
The study defines one group as

45:11.400 --> 45:13.400
previously infected individuals

45:13.400 --> 45:15.400
who have not been vaccinated.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.400
But for our purposes here,

45:17.400 --> 45:19.400
this isn't accurate.

45:19.400 --> 45:21.400
The group is actually previously

45:21.400 --> 45:23.400
infected individuals who have not been

45:23.400 --> 45:25.400
vaccinated and survived

45:25.400 --> 45:27.400
catching COVID the first time

45:27.400 --> 45:29.400
if you follow. If you're wanting

45:29.400 --> 45:31.400
to know if you should get vaccinated,

45:31.400 --> 45:33.400
this group is not a fair comparison to

45:33.400 --> 45:35.400
the vaccinated group because it's

45:35.400 --> 45:37.400
excluding those who caught COVID

45:37.400 --> 45:39.400
and did not recover. The

45:39.400 --> 45:41.400
individuals in this group have been filtered

45:41.400 --> 45:43.400
already. They've had to pass a relevant

45:43.400 --> 45:45.400
health check. That being, if you

45:45.400 --> 45:47.400
get COVID, will you die

45:47.400 --> 45:49.400
and therefore not be able to be

45:49.400 --> 45:51.400
retested in the future? Those

45:51.400 --> 45:53.400
at most risk if they catch COVID,

45:53.400 --> 45:55.400
you know, the people least likely to have

45:55.400 --> 45:57.400
asymptomatic cases, the people most

45:57.400 --> 45:59.400
likely to end up hospitalized,

45:59.400 --> 46:01.400
they've been excluded from this sample

46:01.400 --> 46:03.400
already. You can't compare these

46:03.400 --> 46:05.400
two groups by saying, look, the

46:05.400 --> 46:07.400
unvaccinated people are healthier, so

46:07.400 --> 46:09.400
get vaccinated because you're not

46:09.400 --> 46:11.400
counting all the unvaccinated people

46:11.400 --> 46:13.400
who aren't around to get retested.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.400
Now, did these possible

46:15.400 --> 46:17.400
biasing factors actually influence

46:17.400 --> 46:19.400
the results of the study?

46:19.400 --> 46:21.400
Well, I don't know, honestly.

46:21.400 --> 46:23.400
It's a preprint study. It hasn't been

46:23.400 --> 46:25.400
peer reviewed. But to be clear

46:25.400 --> 46:27.400
here, the study not being peer reviewed

46:27.400 --> 46:29.400
yet doesn't mean it's wrong, necessarily.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.400
Preprint studies can be

46:31.400 --> 46:33.400
very useful, but what we can't

46:33.400 --> 46:35.400
do is say with any degree of certainty

46:35.400 --> 46:37.400
that it is correct. I wouldn't

46:37.400 --> 46:39.400
bet my life or my health on it

46:39.400 --> 46:41.400
being correct, and nor should

46:41.400 --> 46:43.400
anybody else. But for the sake of

46:43.400 --> 46:45.400
the argument, let's imagine this

46:45.400 --> 46:47.400
study is entirely correct.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.400
Now, what would it mean if this

46:49.400 --> 46:51.400
study was entirely correct?

46:51.400 --> 46:53.400
Well, what it would mean is that if

46:53.400 --> 46:55.400
you aren't vaccinated, you should go and

46:55.400 --> 46:57.400
get vaccinated as soon as possible.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.400
Because the study didn't just compare

46:59.400 --> 47:01.400
people with natural immunity to people

47:01.400 --> 47:03.400
with vaccine immunity, it also

47:03.400 --> 47:05.400
looked at people who have both.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.400
And it found that people with both

47:07.400 --> 47:09.400
have the best protection.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.400
You don't even have to read the whole study to find this out.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.400
They put it right there in the conclusions.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.400
Individuals who were both

47:15.400 --> 47:17.400
previously infected and

47:17.400 --> 47:19.400
given a single dose of the vaccine

47:19.400 --> 47:21.400
gained additional protection against

47:21.400 --> 47:23.400
the Delta variant. Max Blumenfall

47:23.400 --> 47:25.400
makes it sound like this is an either

47:25.400 --> 47:27.400
or situation. Either

47:27.400 --> 47:29.400
you have natural immunity, or you

47:29.400 --> 47:31.400
have vaccine immunity, and you can

47:31.400 --> 47:33.400
only have one. But this isn't

47:33.400 --> 47:35.400
how it works. You can both have caught

47:35.400 --> 47:37.400
COVID and gotten vaccinated.

47:37.400 --> 47:39.400
And this paper, even if it's

47:39.400 --> 47:41.400
right, comes to the conclusion that

47:41.400 --> 47:43.400
being vaccinated gives you

47:43.400 --> 47:45.400
additional protection. So

47:45.400 --> 47:47.400
why didn't Blumenfall tweet

47:47.400 --> 47:49.400
bombshell study shows being vaccinated

47:49.400 --> 47:51.400
gives additional protection against

47:51.400 --> 47:53.400
the Delta variant? Why

47:53.400 --> 47:55.400
vax people with natural immunity?

47:55.400 --> 47:57.400
Ask Blumenfall and Jimmy Dore. Well,

47:57.400 --> 47:59.400
I don't know. How about you actually

47:59.400 --> 48:01.400
read the paper that you cite

48:01.400 --> 48:03.400
in your video?

48:03.400 --> 48:05.400
That might be asking a bit much, though,

48:05.400 --> 48:07.400
on YouTube.

48:07.400 --> 48:09.400
Thanks a lot for watching today, folks.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.400
But before I go,

48:11.400 --> 48:13.400
a general disclaimer.

48:13.400 --> 48:15.400
Please do not take medical advice

48:15.400 --> 48:17.400
from YouTube videos, particularly

48:17.400 --> 48:19.400
a ranty comedian's YouTube

48:19.400 --> 48:21.400
videos. As a YouTuber

48:21.400 --> 48:23.400
myself, I know hundreds of

48:23.400 --> 48:25.400
different ways that we can manipulate

48:25.400 --> 48:27.400
facts, present biased narratives,

48:27.400 --> 48:29.400
and just lie to you

48:29.400 --> 48:31.400
and get paid doing it.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.400
You don't even have to be that sneaky.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.400
99% of your audience will

48:35.400 --> 48:37.400
never go and confirm anything you

48:37.400 --> 48:39.400
say. You can just lie

48:39.400 --> 48:41.400
on here. There are no checks.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.400
We are bound to the truth by

48:43.400 --> 48:45.400
zero regulations.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.400
As long as we don't literally break the

48:47.400 --> 48:49.400
law, we can tell you anything

48:49.400 --> 48:51.400
we want with zero repercussions.

48:51.400 --> 48:53.400
And this goes for me, too,

48:53.400 --> 48:55.400
of course. All I can do is

48:55.400 --> 48:57.400
relay to you that medical experts

48:57.400 --> 48:59.400
and medical institutions overwhelmingly

48:59.400 --> 49:01.400
advise vaccination against COVID-19.

49:01.400 --> 49:03.400
And I would ask that

49:03.400 --> 49:05.400
if you're not vaccinated yet, you go

49:05.400 --> 49:07.400
and confirm that information, and

49:07.400 --> 49:09.400
so long as you're able, get

49:09.400 --> 49:11.400
vaccinated. Jimmy Dore likes

49:11.400 --> 49:13.400
to say that everyone will get COVID

49:13.400 --> 49:15.400
eventually, and in preparation for

49:15.400 --> 49:17.400
that, please get vaccinated.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.400
You are much less likely to end up

49:19.400 --> 49:21.400
hospitalized, and you are much less likely

49:21.400 --> 49:23.400
to end up dead from catching COVID-19

49:23.400 --> 49:25.400
if you are vaccinated.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.400
It's vastly safer,

49:27.400 --> 49:29.400
not just for you personally, but

49:29.400 --> 49:31.400
also for anyone you interact with.

49:31.400 --> 49:33.400
And for those who don't like needles,

49:33.400 --> 49:35.400
I completely understand. I

49:35.400 --> 49:37.400
don't like them either, but I've had

49:37.400 --> 49:39.400
two COVID-19 jabs so far

49:39.400 --> 49:41.400
and I honestly didn't even feel

49:41.400 --> 49:43.400
either one of them. And that's

49:43.400 --> 49:45.400
not because I'm so tough, by the way.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.400
I have a very low threshold

49:47.400 --> 49:49.400
for pain. Thank you,

49:49.400 --> 49:51.400
as always, to my patrons, who are

49:51.400 --> 49:53.400
lovely and should be scrolling by right now.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.400
I'll leave a link to my Patreon

49:55.400 --> 49:57.400
in the video description if you'd like to check it

49:57.400 --> 49:59.400
out. Right, that's all from me today,

49:59.400 --> 50:01.400
folks. I'll see you next time.
