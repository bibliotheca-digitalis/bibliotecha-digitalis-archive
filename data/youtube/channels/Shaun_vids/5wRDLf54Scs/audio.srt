00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about anti-vaccine propaganda.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,700
Now, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has obviously seen rise to a lot of discussion of vaccines,

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,800
and also, sadly, a lot of awful anti-vaccine arguments.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,000
And for examples of how this sort of propaganda works, we're going to take a look at The Jimmy Dore Show.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,300
Now, Jimmy Dore is a comedian and political commentator who hosts The Jimmy Dore Show here on YouTube,

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,600
on a channel with around 900,000 subscribers.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,700
If you aren't familiar with The Jimmy Dore Show, Jimmy Dore styles himself as someone who critiques the political establishment,

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,300
including the Democrats, from the left.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,400
And until recently, his commentary on vaccines followed that approach.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,200
On December 21st of last year, Dore put out a video titled,

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Vaccine for Elites, but Not for Nurses,

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,200
in which he expresses his anger that healthcare executives were getting vaccinated before frontline workers.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,000
On April 30th of this year, Dore put out a video titled,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,100
Bill Gates Denies Vaccine to Poor Countries,

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,500
in which he criticizes Gates for arguing in favor of patent protections on vaccines.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,000
And on the 2nd of March of last year, he put out a video titled,

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,300
Pelosi, Corona Vaccine Should Be Affordable, WTF, where he says the following.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,800
She wants to make the vaccines affordable.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
She is a virus.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,900
Yes, what kind of, you have to have a virus in your brain to think that, hey,

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,400
you know, we could, we could, well, here's what I said.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,500
Of course, we could distribute the vaccine to all citizens as soon as it's available and stop a pandemic,

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
but we're not filthy socialists.

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,200
So lots of people are going to die.

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,600
That's what she's saying.

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:52,000
A functioning government would fucking inoculated citizenry against a goddamn pandemic and forget about a fucking profit motive.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,500
So from these videos and others, Dore's position appears to be that vaccines are a good thing,

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,700
that they should be free, available to everyone regardless of status,

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,000
and that distributing the vaccine to all citizens as soon as it's available would stop the pandemic.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
However, recently, something strange has been going on over at the Jimmy Dore show.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,500
Dore has taken a hard turn into peddling anti-vaccine propaganda in videos that are absolutely full of deception,

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,600
flawed logic, and outright lies.

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,400
As for why this is, you only need to go to his channel and look at the view counts on his recent videos.

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,500
His anti-vaccine videos are some of the most popular content he's produced this year.

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:42,400
Bringing in a piece of the anti-vaccine audience provides a real financial incentive to keep producing that sort of content,

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,000
because some of those new viewers attracted by the anti-vaccine content will become premium members,

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
or head over to the Jimmy Dore Comedy Store, where they can buy mugs and hoodies and bags and hats and shirts and so on.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,500
Now, you might say,

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,400
hold up there a second, Sean.

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,700
Maybe this is an unfair criticism.

41
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Maybe this has nothing to do with money or chasing views.

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,100
Maybe this is just a coincidence.

43
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:13,700
Maybe Jimmy Dore just genuinely believes in the anti-vaccine arguments he feels compelled to share with the world.

44
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,200
Maybe he's just not had good counterarguments yet.

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
And I will admit that this is a possibility.

46
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
A slight possibility.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,500
So, let's take a look at some of these arguments, then.

48
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,900
The first video I want to look at is titled,

49
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,600
Outbreak! 80% Vaccinated Singapore Has More Infections Than Ever, Released on October 6th.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,900
This video features Dore reading out an article from Fortune.com titled,

51
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,800
Highly Vaccinated But More Cases Than Ever.

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,100
Singapore Shows The World What Endemic COVID Might Look Like, written by Grady McGregor.

53
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,600
And this video from Dore is a real masterclass in misleading an audience.

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,800
And to see what Dore does here, we're gonna read this article along with him and see how he represents it.

55
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
So, the article starts out,

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,800
highly vaccinated Singapore is battling a record wave of COVID-19 infections,

57
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,500
just as the city plans to reopen to the world.

58
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,300
But Singapore's 80% vaccination rate has kept severe cases and deaths down,

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:19,300
potentially proving that living with the virus versus trying to eradicate it is the surest path out of the pandemic.

60
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,500
Now, here's how Jimmy Dore starts reading the article.

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,800
On Monday, Singapore recorded 1,647 cases of COVID-19,

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,800
bringing its seven-day daily average to 1,545 cases,

63
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,400
higher than any other previous wave of the pandemic.

64
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
So what he did there was skip the first paragraph,

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,800
the one that states that Singapore's high vaccination rate has kept severe cases and deaths down,

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,800
and he started reading at the second paragraph, talking about the recent increase in COVID cases.

67
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,800
So he's avoided mentioning the positive effects of the high vaccination rate there.

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,300
But let's not draw any conclusions right now.

69
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,900
So, following this sentence read out by Dore, the article says,

70
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,200
But even as cases soar, COVID-19 deaths in Singapore have remained low.

71
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,200
The city's state of 5.7 million people has averaged three deaths per day in the last week.

72
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Singapore's saving grace is its high vaccination coverage.

73
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
So let's hear Jimmy read that.

74
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Uh, hang on, where is he?

75
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,700
Oh, he skipped down to here, the sentence that starts out,

76
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,700
So that's twice now that he's skipped mentioning the positive effects of vaccination.

77
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,200
Now, the sentence following this one also mentions Singapore's low death rate.

78
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,700
It says,

79
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
So, let's listen to Jimmy read that.

80
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Singapore has now fully vaccinated over 80% of its population,

81
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,700
one of the highest rates in the world!

82
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
No, he's gone again.

83
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Now he's back up here, having expertly dodged multiple separate instances of the article

84
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,200
directly praising Singapore's high vaccination rate.

85
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,700
The best that Jimmy Dore manages is showing this one reference to quote,

86
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,200
But he does not make clear, as the article does,

87
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,500
that this widespread immunity is due in large part to the high vaccination rate.

88
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
And this is how Jimmy reads out the rest of the article.

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Well, no, he's not reading the article, really.

90
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,500
He's picking particular sentences out of it in order to present a biased view of it.

91
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,500
This is an article about how Singapore's high vaccination rate has kept deaths low

92
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,500
even as virus cases increase as the country eases lockdown restrictions.

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
It's a success story.

94
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Jimmy Dore, by refusing to mention the positive effects of vaccination,

95
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,800
turns it into a scaremongering article about an increase in cases

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
in order to make the vaccine look ineffective.

97
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Now, further down the article,

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Jimmy Dore does something even worse than simply selectively quote the article.

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
He actually changes the text in order to better suit his argument.

100
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
So, first, let's read the relevant part of the article.

101
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,100
Throughout July and August, cases in Singapore ticked up to over 100 per day

102
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,100
after nearly a year of almost no infections due to the city's previous zero tolerance policy.

103
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,100
That policy included stay-at-home orders, intensive testing and contact tracing,

104
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
and a ban on foreign visitors.

105
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,100
This month, cases have risen exponentially from 180 on September 1st

106
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,100
to roughly 500 by mid-September and to nearly 1,500 this week.

107
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,100
On Monday, Singapore said that it would reintroduce some social distancing measures

108
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
including reducing dining groups from five to two people at restaurants

109
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
and directing companies to allow employees to work from home.

110
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Singapore's government said the measures will be in place for at least one month

111
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed

112
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
and to allow the city to scale up services to help infected patients recover at home.

113
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
So what's happened here, according to this article anyway,

114
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,400
is that Singapore had very strict lockdown measures

115
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
and a low number of coronavirus cases.

116
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Once a large percentage of the country was vaccinated, however,

117
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
they started easing those lockdown measures

118
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,700
which led, of course, expectedly, to an increase in cases.

119
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,700
But since the country has a very high vaccination rate,

120
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
the number of deaths remained low.

121
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,700
The vaccine, of course, does not make you completely immune from catching the virus

122
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,700
but it does make it much, much less likely that you will develop serious symptoms

123
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,700
or die as a result of catching the virus.

124
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,700
However, Singapore is still wary of overloading its hospitals

125
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,700
so is planning to reintroduce lockdown measures as needed

126
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,000
in order to control the number of cases.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This all makes perfect sense.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Very strict lockdown orders, then a high vaccination rate,

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
then a lifting of those orders leading to increasing cases

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
with some orders reintroduced in order to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is not too hard to follow, you'd think.

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But Singapore's growing caseload has raised alarms, nonetheless,

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
because of the speed at which cases have climbed.

134
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Despite policies including stay-at-home orders,

135
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,300
intensive testing and contact tracing,

136
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,300
and a ban on foreign visitors,

137
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,300
and 80% of them are vaccinated,

138
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
they're having the biggest outbreak ever.

139
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,300
Now, sharp-eyed viewers will have noticed

140
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,300
that what Daw just read out is not what the article says.

141
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
And let's look at them side by side here.

142
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
The article says,

143
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Throughout July and August, cases in Singapore ticked up to over 100 per day

144
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
after nearly a year of almost no infections

145
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
due to the city's previous zero tolerance policy.

146
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Emphasis on the word previous there.

147
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Then it goes on to say,

148
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
That policy included stay-at-home orders,

149
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
intensive testing and so on.

150
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Jimmy Daw's text says,

151
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
The speed at which cases have climbed despite policies

152
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
including stay-at-home orders, intensive testing and so on.

153
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
He snips out the sentence,

154
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,900
making it clear that these policies were the previous policies,

155
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,900
the policies that were lifted,

156
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,900
and he puts the word despite in there.

157
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
Now, the word despite is not in this paragraph in the original article,

158
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,900
and this makes it seem like these policies are current, ongoing policies.

159
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,900
He's rewriting what the article says to make it say something different.

160
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
Now, I'd like to pause here and ask a question

161
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,900
to any fans of Jimmy Daw's content that might be watching this video.

162
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Now, I know that the response to me saying

163
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Jimmy Daw produces anti-vaccine content will be to say,

164
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
No, he doesn't.

165
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Daw doesn't directly tell anyone not to get the vaccine.

166
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
He got the vaccine.

167
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,200
And he says that you can get the vaccine if you like.

168
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
You know, he's not anti-vaccine.

169
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
He's just asking questions.

170
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
He's just got some concerns.

171
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
He's just reporting the vaccine news.

172
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Now, my question is, if this was true,

173
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
if Jimmy Daw really was just innocently asking questions

174
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
and provoking debate,

175
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
why does he need to lie?

176
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Why is he selectively quoting the article

177
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
to avoid mentioning the positive effects of vaccination?

178
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Why is he editing the text of the article

179
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
to make lockdown measures seem ineffective?

180
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
If he was just reporting the news,

181
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
he would just read out the article in full, right?

182
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
If he's just asking questions,

183
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
why not ask,

184
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Why does Singapore have one of the lowest COVID death rates in the world?

185
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
And the answer is because Jimmy Daw

186
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,500
is trying to present a biased view of vaccines.

187
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
He is producing content specifically

188
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,800
to attempt to draw in an anti-vaccine audience.

189
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,800
He's just doing it with plausible deniability,

190
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
because he doesn't want to be banned by YouTube.

191
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
But let's be fair here.

192
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Maybe you're thinking,

193
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Well, okay, the way Jimmy Daw read out that one article

194
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
was a bit dodgy,

195
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
but I'm not ready to brand him a liar over it.

196
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
I need more evidence for that.

197
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
So, okay, how about this?

198
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
On the 14th of October,

199
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
the site healthfeedback.org

200
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
published an article that was critical

201
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
of Jimmy Daw's statements about COVID-19.

202
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
And in particular here,

203
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
we're interested in their criticism of his statements

204
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
about the drug ivermectin.

205
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
They say,

206
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
While it is true that ivermectin is used in humans

207
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
and that the scientist who discovered it

208
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
won a Nobel Prize,

209
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
what Daw didn't tell his viewers

210
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
was that neither of those facts have any bearing

211
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
on whether ivermectin is effective against COVID-19,

212
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
specifically.

213
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Reliable studies haven't shown that ivermectin

214
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
is effective against COVID-19.

215
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
So, apparently, Jimmy Daw has been spreading

216
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
inaccurate information about ivermectin,

217
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
telling his audience

218
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
that ivermectin is effective in treating COVID,

219
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
which would be very irresponsible.

220
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
However,

221
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
in a video posted to YouTube on the 19th of October,

222
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
Jimmy Daw defended himself

223
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
against the claims in this article

224
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
by saying that they're all made up.

225
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
So, according to Jimmy Daw,

226
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
he's never said anything like the claims in the article.

227
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
He's never said ivermectin is effective in treating COVID.

228
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
However,

229
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Uh-oh.

230
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Now, if you go looking for that video

231
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
on Jimmy Daw's YouTube channel,

232
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
you won't find it.

233
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
It's actually specifically against

234
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
YouTube's content policies to post videos

235
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
that feature, quote,

236
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
categorical claims that ivermectin

237
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
is an effective treatment for COVID-19.

238
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
So, did YouTube delete that video?

239
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Did Jimmy Daw take it down,

240
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
perhaps in preparation for COVID-19?

241
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
So, did YouTube delete that video?

242
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Did Jimmy Daw take it down?

243
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Perhaps in preparation to claim

244
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
that he never said exactly

245
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
what he did say in the video?

246
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I don't know.

247
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
What Jimmy can't take down, though,

248
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
is his appearance on Joe Rogan's show.

249
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
So, what about, uh, like,

250
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
can we talk about ivermectin?

251
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Yeah, sure.

252
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
So, I covered it,

253
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
what they did in Mexico City,

254
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
and ivermectin seems to be

255
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
a drug that not only treats it,

256
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
but it will prevent you from getting it.

257
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Well, now, according to Jimmy Daw,

258
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
ivermectin doesn't just seem

259
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
like it treats COVID,

260
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
it will actually stop you from getting it

261
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
altogether. Now, if you watched that clip,

262
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
it's quite funny, because by making

263
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
such a direct medical claim,

264
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
he clearly worries Rogan a bit,

265
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
who starts saying, well, we need more studies,

266
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
you know, I'm just an MMA guy,

267
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
don't listen to me about health stuff.

268
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Rogan's clearly also worried about the

269
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
wrath of the YouTube censors.

270
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
And speaking of, Jimmy Daw's

271
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
last video, YouTube's new censorship

272
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
rampage over vaccines,

273
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
starts out with Daw making a rather

274
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
embarrassing error.

275
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
And I wish I had Glenn Greenwald on to talk

276
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
about this with me, but the irony here

277
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
is that

278
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
inside this article,

279
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
talking about how YouTube's

280
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
gonna stop misinformation about vaccines,

281
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
it includes misinformation

282
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
about vaccines.

283
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
This is from the AP,

284
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
this will not be censored at

285
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Twitter, this will not be censored at,

286
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
this is misinformation.

287
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
That is not true.

288
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Scientists do not say

289
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
that the vaccines will end

290
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
the COVID-19 pandemic.

291
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
That is not what they say.

292
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Do you want to know what they say?

293
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
COVID-19 won't be

294
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
eradicated. Who says that?

295
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
The who? The WHO.

296
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
The World Health

297
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Organization says that.

298
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
The AP is misinforming

299
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
you. So do you understand

300
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
why there shouldn't be censorship ever?

301
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
So Daw first shows this article

302
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
from the AP which states that scientists

303
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
say public acceptance of

304
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
free immunizations will end the

305
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
COVID-19 pandemic.

306
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Then he shows this article from TheHill.com

307
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
which states global health experts

308
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
say COVID-19 won't

309
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
be eradicated. Now Daw

310
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
treats these quotes as if they're contradictory

311
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
and goes on for several minutes about

312
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
how this proves the press is lying to you

313
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
and you can't censor independent voices

314
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
like his, and so on.

315
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
However, he's made a mistake here

316
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
because these two quotes are not contradictory.

317
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Ending the current

318
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
COVID-19 pandemic can be done

319
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
without eradicating COVID-19

320
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
because the word pandemic describes

321
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
the state, not the existence

322
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
of the virus. With sufficient

323
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
resistance to the virus, the worldwide pandemic

324
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
would end, even if the virus

325
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
itself continues to circulate.

326
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
And one of the best ways to increase a population's

327
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
resistance to the virus is

328
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
widespread vaccination. Now you'd

329
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
think Jimmy Daw would know this, since

330
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
as we saw earlier, he stated last

331
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
year that distributing the vaccine to

332
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
all citizens as soon as it's available

333
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
would stop the pandemic. Now this

334
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
either means that Jimmy Daw believes that

335
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
ending the pandemic necessarily entails

336
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
entirely wiping out the virus,

337
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
and I don't believe he's that clueless,

338
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
or it means that he did understand

339
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
that widespread vaccination could end

340
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
the pandemic as he stated, and he's

341
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
just decided to forget

342
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
that information, for some

343
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
reason. Next up, I want

344
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
to give an example of how bad scientific

345
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
practices can give rise to

346
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
anti-vaccine myths. So let's

347
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
start with the Jimmy Daw video study

348
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Vaccines Being Administered Incorrectly,

349
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
and we will track this claim back

350
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
to the source. So in this video,

351
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Jimmy Daw is arguing that the way

352
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
COVID-19 vaccines are administered

353
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
is incorrect and dangerous,

354
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
and he does this by watching and repeating

355
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
the arguments of a different YouTube video

356
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
that being inadvertent intravenous

357
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
injections from a YouTuber

358
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
called John Campbell. In that

359
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
video, Campbell is reading out the study

360
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus

361
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Disease 2019 MRNA

362
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Vaccine Can Induce Acute

363
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Myopericarditis in

364
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Mouse Model. So what did this

365
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
study investigate? Well, the COVID-19

366
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
vaccine is an intramuscular

367
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
or IM injection,

368
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
meaning it's injected into a muscle,

369
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
typically the deltoid. This

370
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
study attempts to discover what would happen with

371
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
an intravenous or IV

372
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
injection of the vaccine, meaning it's injected

373
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
directly into the bloodstream.

374
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
So they injected some mice with

375
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
the vaccine, some with IM

376
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
injections, some with IV injections.

377
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Later, they dissected

378
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
the mice, the poor

379
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
mice, and they report that they found

380
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
myopericarditis in the IV

381
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
group, myopericarditis

382
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
being an inflammation of parts of

383
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
the heart. So the conclusion this

384
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
far would seem to be that IV injection

385
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
of the vaccine can be bad for the heart.

386
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Emphasis on seem

387
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
to be. Please do not actually

388
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
make any conclusions right now. Stick with

389
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
me to the end of this bit. Trust me, there

390
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
is a twist up ahead. Now of

391
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
course, in humans, the vaccine is

392
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
injected in a muscle and not

393
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
intravenously, so we might say

394
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
what's the problem, right? Just don't

395
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
inject it intravenously and we're okay.

396
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
But what the authors of this study

397
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
are concerned about is the possibility of

398
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
an accidental intravenous injection.

399
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
So the person administering

400
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
the injection aims to inject the vaccine

401
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
into a muscle but accidentally injects

402
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
it into the bloodstream. And

403
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
they recommend blood aspiration as a way

404
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
to avoid this possibility. Now

405
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
aspiration is the drawing back of the syringe

406
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
plunger after insertion to

407
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
check if any blood flows back into the

408
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
needle, basically. They recommend this

409
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
as a way for the person administering the vaccine

410
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
to make sure they're injecting in the right place.

411
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
However, the World Health Organization

412
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
and the Centers for Disease Control

413
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
and Prevention do not recommend

414
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
aspiration during the administration of the

415
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
vaccine because the size of the needle

416
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
and the size of the blood vessels at the site

417
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
of injection mean that it's an unnecessary

418
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
practice, they say. The CDC

419
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
guidance on vaccine administration

420
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
states that aspiration before

421
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
injection of vaccines or toxoids

422
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
is not necessary because no large

423
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
blood vessels are present at the recommended

424
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
injection sites. If this is

425
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
true, it means that there is no way to

426
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
accidentally replicate the sort

427
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
of intentional intravenous injection

428
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
seen in the experiment with the mice.

429
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
So since they consider it unnecessary

430
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
and it also leads to more painful

431
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
injections, they recommend against

432
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
it. Now it needs to be made very clear

433
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
here that this study did not find evidence

434
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
of accidental intravenous injections

435
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
of any COVID-19 vaccine.

436
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
That's not what the study was about.

437
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
They treated it as a hypothetical possibility

438
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
and then sought to investigate what would happen

439
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
as a result. For evidence

440
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
of the possibility of accidental

441
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
intravenous injection, they point to a study

442
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
called Blood Aspiration During

443
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
IM Injection, a self-reporting

444
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
study of nurses who were asked

445
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
questions about blood aspiration.

446
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
But I find this kind of tenuous.

447
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
That study concerns all

448
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
intramuscular medical injections,

449
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
not just vaccine injections,

450
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
in different parts of the body, not just

451
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
where vaccines are usually administered,

452
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
and it had an incredibly small

453
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
sample size, being quote,

454
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
limited to nurses in one small community

455
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
hospital and one state university.

456
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
The study did not survey all

457
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
the nurses in these settings. As a

458
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
result, the sample may not represent the

459
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
population of nurses practicing and

460
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
cannot be generalized. So what

461
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
do we have here then? Well, we have

462
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
one study arguing in favor of

463
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
aspiration during vaccine injections

464
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
versus the generally accepted guidelines

465
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
stating that it's unnecessary.

466
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Phrasing this extremely generously

467
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
to the authors of the study, we could say that

468
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
some medical professionals recommend

469
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
aspiration for vaccine injections

470
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
and some don't. So how do we

471
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
get from here to Jimmy Dore stating

472
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
outright that they're administering

473
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
the jabs incorrectly?

474
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
And now we find out they're administering

475
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
the jabs incorrectly.

476
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Jimmy Dore

477
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
has taken it upon himself to settle the

478
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
argument here, and he's done it seemingly

479
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
at random. He's picked the side that

480
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
agrees with him, funnily enough,

481
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
and said they're the ones who are correct

482
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
here, based upon no evidence

483
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
other than what he would like to be true

484
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
it seems. Now it might shock

485
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
you to hear this, but I disagree

486
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
with Jimmy Dore here. By itself

487
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
I don't find this study

488
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
credible, but unlike Jimmy Dore

489
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
I have an actual reason

490
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
for thinking that. So this

491
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
paper was linked on pubpia.com

492
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
which is a website for discussion and

493
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
review of scientific publications.

494
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
And the top comment is from Elizabeth

495
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
M. Bick. Now Elizabeth

496
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Bick has a Wikipedia page, and allow me

497
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
to quote briefly from that.

498
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Elizabeth Bick is a Dutch microbiologist

499
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
and scientific integrity consultant.

500
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Bick is known for her work detecting

501
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
photo manipulation in scientific publications

502
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
and identifying over 4,000

503
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
potential cases of improper research

504
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
conduct. So Elizabeth Bick

505
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
and the other commenters on pubpia have some

506
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
concerns about this paper.

507
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
And allow me to relay a few of those.

508
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Firstly, there's some discussion about

509
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
the amount of vaccine that the mice

510
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
were administered, with Bick estimating

511
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
that the mice received a dose that was

512
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
relative to their body weight between

513
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
50 and 500 times the

514
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
dose which is given to a human. However

515
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
another comment points out that due to

516
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
the metabolic differences between mice

517
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
and humans, the relative difference in

518
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
dosage wouldn't actually be that extreme.

519
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
However they still estimate that it would

520
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
be multiple times the dose given to a

521
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
human. Now I don't know anything

522
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
about the relative metabolic rates

523
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
of mice and men, I'm afraid.

524
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
So I'm gonna call this one a wash.

525
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
You know, it's a possible overdose. But I can't

526
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
say conclusively because I just don't

527
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
know. I have no way to fairly

528
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
decide one way or the other here.

529
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
So next up, and more conclusively,

530
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
the commenters claim the strain of

531
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
lab mice that were used in the study are

532
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
apparently prone to the sort of heart problems

533
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
that the study was looking for. And I quote

534
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Pericardial fibrosis and

535
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
mineralization is a common background

536
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
finding in healthy Balb C

537
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
mice, as any pathologist with mouse

538
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
experience can attest.

539
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
The lesions shown in figures 1 and 2

540
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
show pericardial fibrosis and

541
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
calcification 1 or 2 days

542
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
after vaccination, which seems incredibly

543
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
fast. It usually takes 5

544
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
days to see this extent of fibrosis.

545
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
And other commenters chimed

546
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
in supporting these claims, with one

547
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
stating, this paper reports what appears

548
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
to be naturally occurring pericardial

549
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
lesions in Balb C mice.

550
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
It's essentially impossible to get such

551
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
advanced lesions in 1-2 days

552
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
post-injection. Now, if this

553
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
were true, if this study really is

554
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
just showing what were already existing

555
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
heart issues in these mice,

556
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
why is the study reporting that they were found

557
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
more often in the intravenous

558
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
group? What a mystery

559
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
we have here. Well, let's attempt to solve

560
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
it. And we'll start with a very basic

561
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
hypothesis.

562
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
What if the authors of this study

563
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
just mixed the mice up?

564
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
You know, what if it was that simple?

565
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
So, let's investigate, if

566
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
only to disprove this hypothesis.

567
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Now, this study includes lots

568
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
of pictures of dead and dissected

569
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
mice, which do not worry, I will not

570
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
be showing here. What I will

571
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
be showing is scans of their heart

572
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
tissue, such as this one, figure

573
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
2, which shows, quote, blue

574
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
stained thickened visceral pericardium

575
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
over the right atrium and

576
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
ventricle at 1 dpi of IV

577
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
vaccine, which became more prominent

578
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
at 2 dpi, that's days

579
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
post-injection there. So,

580
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
this scan in figure 2a shows a

581
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
heart from the group which was given the intravenous

582
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
mRNA vaccine, and

583
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
the authors identify what they say are

584
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
problems with it. So, let's take

585
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
a look at how this compares to a scan of a

586
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
heart from the group of mice who were given the

587
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
intramuscular injection.

588
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
So, this is figure 5, from the section

589
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
titled, IM mRNA Vaccine

590
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Administration Only Induced Mild

591
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Myocardial Congestion and

592
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Edema. And this particular scan

593
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
in figure 5c is from a mouse

594
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
who received an IM injection

595
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
instead of an IV injection

596
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
and thus has fewer heart problems

597
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
apparently. And let's take a look at these

598
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
side by side. So, IV

599
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
mouse on the left, IM

600
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
mouse on the right. Except,

601
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
and I've always wanted to

602
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
do this, computer

603
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
enhance, rotate

604
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
right image 115 degrees,

605
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
combine.

606
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
And, would you look at that,

607
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
this is the same image

608
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
right here. These heart scans are cited

609
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
both to show the damage caused by

610
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
intravenous injection and

611
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
the relative lack of damage caused by

612
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
intramuscular injection, but it's

613
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
the same scan. This is the

614
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
same mouse. So,

615
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
what happened here then? Well,

616
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
to put it in scientific terms,

617
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
they balled it up. This

618
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
same sample is marked both IV

619
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
vaccine 2dpi and

620
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
IM vaccine 2dpi,

621
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
which were the two groups the study was

622
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
seeking to compare. So, they've

623
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
mixed something up somewhere, clearly.

624
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
And props to Elizabeth Bick and

625
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
the commenters over at Pubpia for

626
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
spotting this, of course. Now, what

627
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
this means is that the results of this

628
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
study are suspect now.

629
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
How many other samples did the authors

630
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
of this study accidentally put in the wrong

631
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
groups? I don't know,

632
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
and nor does John Campbell or

633
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Jimmy Dore. All we can conclusively

634
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
learn from this study is that the study should

635
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
probably be performed again.

636
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Now, to be fair, you might argue

637
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
that maybe I'm overplaying this

638
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
one mistake. After all, it is

639
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
only one mistake, and

640
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
another counterargument could be that the

641
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
strain of mouse doesn't matter too much either,

642
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
even if they are prone to heart

643
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
problems, because with a large enough sample

644
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
size, those problems and

645
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
the occasional mistake wouldn't

646
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
impact the overall data

647
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
too much. It would all come out in

648
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
the wash. So, what

649
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
sort of group sizes are we

650
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
looking at with these mice? Well,

651
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
six

652
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
mice, for instance, in the

653
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
2DPI-IM group.

654
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
So, and this is something

655
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
important to remember beyond this one study

656
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
by the way, if you ever hear that

657
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
this or that was found in 50%

658
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
of tested mice, that

659
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
could be only three mice,

660
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
one of which in this particular study

661
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
ended up in the wrong group somehow.

662
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
What we're seeing here is bad science

663
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
getting picked up and repeated by

664
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
anti-vaccine propagandists.

665
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Jimmy Dore and John Campbell

666
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
between them have 2 million YouTube

667
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
subscribers, and their videos using

668
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
this study to claim vaccines are being

669
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
administered incorrectly have hundreds

670
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
of thousands of views. And

671
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
a lot of those viewers are gonna go away, and all

672
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,400
they'll remember and possibly repeat to

673
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
other people is, well, I saw a video

674
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
about a study that said vaccines

675
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
damage your heart. Pointing out

676
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
the fact that there were major problems with the

677
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
study is all well and good, but it feels

678
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
like the damage has already been done at this

679
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
point. Now, just to be clear

680
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
here, this study is rubbish,

681
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
but I don't mean to give the impression

682
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
that an accidental intravenous injection

683
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
is completely impossible.

684
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Of course, as with all medical procedures,

685
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
mistakes can and do happen.

686
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
And with millions of

687
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
vaccinations being carried out, it would be unreasonable

688
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
to assume that no mistakes occur

689
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
anywhere. And if some more

690
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
rigorous studies than this one led to a change

691
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
in the way the medical community at large

692
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
administers vaccines, I would have

693
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
no criticism of that. And

694
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
if further, even more rigorous

695
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
studies were then carried out and the medical

696
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
community changed back to the current

697
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
way of administering vaccines, I'd

698
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
have no criticism of that either.

699
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Medical science, like all

700
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
science, changes and updates

701
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
as we learn new information. It's not

702
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
some hypocrisy, it's not some

703
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
trick being played on us, it's just

704
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
the way science happens.

705
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Anyway, let's move on and look at another

706
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
video. So this is

707
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Vax Side Effect, Sudden Hearing

708
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Loss Reported. And here, Jimmy

709
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Dore falls into that most classic

710
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
of argumentative pitfalls,

711
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
the correlation versus causation

712
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
misunderstanding. So, the

713
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
portion of this video that is actually about

714
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
hearing loss is mostly just Dore

715
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
watching a news report from ABC15

716
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
about some people who reported

717
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
experiencing tinnitus after being

718
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
vaccinated against COVID-19.

719
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
A lot of Dore's videos

720
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
consist of him just watching other

721
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
videos and making faces at them actually.

722
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Now then, we need

723
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
to be careful and responsible

724
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
when investigating and reporting

725
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
this sort of thing. You see,

726
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
the issue here is one of scale.

727
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
It might be that you can find

728
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
217 people in

729
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Arizona, say, who reported

730
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
tinnitus after being vaccinated.

731
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
But Arizona has a population

732
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
of millions of people,

733
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
and if an area's healthcare system

734
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
vaccinates millions of people, that

735
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
is a huge data set to pull from.

736
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
And tinnitus can have several possible

737
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
causes. Sinus congestion,

738
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
stress, anxiety,

739
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
high blood pressure, and so on.

740
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Out of millions of people,

741
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
we'd expect some of those people

742
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
to report tinnitus anyway

743
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
on just an average week with no

744
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
vaccinations whatsoever.

745
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
So, this could just be a coincidence,

746
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
right? They could be incorrectly

747
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
identifying the cause of their

748
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,400
tinnitus as the recent vaccination

749
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
due to nothing more than unfortunate

750
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
timing. And let's do

751
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
a thought experiment here.

752
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Let's imagine that millions of people

753
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
in a country are asked to go to a medical

754
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
facility and have a doctor or nurse

755
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
click their fingers in front

756
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
of that person's face.

757
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
That's all, then they leave and go

758
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
about their lives. So, the

759
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
basic framework of how we're currently

760
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
vaccinating people only without the

761
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
vaccinations, just a finger click.

762
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Now, of those millions

763
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
of people, some of them will

764
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
develop tinnitus in the following week.

765
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Some of them will experience

766
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
headaches, some of them will have a

767
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
heart attack or a stroke, and some

768
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
of them will die. But none of

769
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
that will have anything at all to do with

770
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
the finger click. It would be a coincidence.

771
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Because we have millions of people

772
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
experiencing an event, we have

773
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
millions of chances for tinnitus

774
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
and headaches and heart attacks

775
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
to happen. But people, as a rule,

776
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
aren't very good at thinking in terms

777
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
of very large numbers. You'd

778
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
only need a dozen or so people having

779
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
heart attacks within a week of the finger click

780
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
to build an alarmist narrative about

781
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
finger clicks causing heart attacks

782
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
or whatever. But they wouldn't,

783
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
of course, it would be entirely coincidental.

784
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
What you would need to start

785
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
to prove a link between finger clicks and

786
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
heart attacks is an elevated

787
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
number of heart attacks relative to

788
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
what we would usually expect.

789
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
By itself, any one case

790
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
is just anecdotal evidence.

791
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
For instance, Nicki Minaj's cousin's

792
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
friend says his testicles swelled

793
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
up after getting vaccinated.

794
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Does that anecdotal evidence

795
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
prove that vaccines make your

796
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
testicles swell? No,

797
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
it doesn't. By themselves, Nicki

798
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Minaj's cousin's friend's giant

799
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
balls can't tell us anything about the

800
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
COVID-19 vaccine. When

801
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
reporting things like this, it's better to

802
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
cite actual medical studies looking

803
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
for a direct link between vaccines

804
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
and various symptoms instead

805
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
of relying on individual anecdotal

806
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
evidence. It's also not good

807
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
to put that anecdotal evidence in a video

808
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
titled, Vax Side Effect

809
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
as if it's already been settled.

810
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Now, I'm sure that right now you're

811
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
all saying, hold up there, Sean.

812
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
COVID-19, as a

813
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
respiratory illness, can cause sinus

814
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
problems and therefore tinnitus.

815
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
And it does so at much higher rates than

816
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
among those who reported tinnitus after

817
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
being vaccinated. And this is especially

818
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
true of the Delta variant, which has been

819
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
shown to more greatly affect the upper

820
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
respiratory tract. So this is all moot,

821
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
right? If you want to avoid getting

822
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
tinnitus, it's still better to be

823
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
vaccinated than not. And you're

824
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
right to say all that. Well done.

825
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
A few anecdotal cases of

826
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
tinnitus not proven to be linked to the

827
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
vaccine is no argument whatsoever

828
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
against the vaccine. It does

829
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
not stand up to scrutiny.

830
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
But here's where we need to talk about the way in

831
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
which conspiracy theories are delivered

832
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
from the conspiracy theorist

833
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
to their audience, which is what is

834
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
happening here. Because the issue

835
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
is that this video is not supposed

836
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
to stand up to scrutiny.

837
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
None of these videos are supposed to

838
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
stand up to scrutiny. They're all

839
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
meant to be only a single piece of evidence

840
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
in this. An

841
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
overwhelming barrage of

842
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
relentless sort of evidence.

843
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
It doesn't matter if you

844
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
disprove one piece of evidence

845
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
because there's just so much of it

846
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
and all of it comes with plausible

847
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
deniability. Jimmy Dawes

848
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
grift works by producing an extremely

849
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
large amount of air quotes

850
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
evidence. None of which, when

851
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
examined closely, will stand up.

852
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
But taken together, it gives

853
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
the impression that there must be

854
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
some sort of point here, right?

855
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
This is the quantity, not

856
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
quality style of argument.

857
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
If you don't like one argument, I've

858
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
got another. And if you don't like that

859
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
argument, I've got another. And

860
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
so on and so forth until you just

861
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
run out of energy to refute all of

862
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
this. And if you ever do manage to

863
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
pin the conspiracy theorist down on one

864
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
particular irrefutable point,

865
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
they'll just lie and claim they

866
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
never said what they said. Like

867
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
we saw Jimmy Dawe do with his statements

868
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
about ivermectin. And

869
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
unfortunately, one result of anti-vaccine

870
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
propaganda like this is that misled

871
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
people end up getting seriously

872
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
sick and possibly dying.

873
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
And here, I'd like to be careful

874
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
to make a distinction between anti-vaccine

875
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
propagandists and people who

876
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
I guess we call vaccine-hesitant.

877
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
The majority of vaccinated people

878
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
fall into the vaccine-hesitant camp.

879
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
They aren't committed to opposing

880
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
vaccines, they just aren't sure

881
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
what is the safest course of action.

882
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Of course, the safest course of action

883
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
is to be vaccinated, and the

884
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
vaccine-hesitant have undoubtedly heard

885
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
a lot of positive things about vaccines,

886
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
but they've also probably heard a fair

887
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
few vaccine lies, like those given

888
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
a platform by people like Jimmy Dawe.

889
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
Now, Dawe himself isn't even

890
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
pushing anti-vaccine conspiracies

891
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
for ideological reasons, I don't think.

892
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
I don't think he actually has any

893
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
opinions, to be honest. He's just someone

894
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
who's willing to cash in on a trend,

895
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
even if it ends up getting people killed.

896
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Anyway, one way the vaccine-

897
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
hesitant group is targeted by

898
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
the propagandists is by exploiting

899
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
a distrust of authority.

900
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Vaccine-hesitant people might not have

901
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
much trust in the political system in which

902
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
they live, and that can be for very

903
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
valid reasons. Beyond the usual

904
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
reasons to distrust people in power,

905
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
with regards to the pandemic, we've

906
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
seen them giving inaccurate or contradictory

907
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
medical advice, making

908
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
promises they can't keep, not

909
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
following their own lockdown regulations,

910
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
and so on. There is a lot

911
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
to criticize there. And there's also

912
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
a lot to criticize the pharmaceutical

913
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
industry for, and this is particularly

914
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
true in the United States, where there is

915
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
an entirely understandable skepticism

916
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
of their for-profit healthcare

917
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
system. So it's easy for the

918
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
propagandists to point to all this hypocrisy,

919
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
corruption, and incompetence,

920
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
and then try to marry that

921
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
to the science of vaccination.

922
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
See, these powerful people

923
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
are clueless, and corrupt, and

924
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
untrustworthy, and they're telling

925
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
you to get vaccinated. So the

926
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
conclusion, either spoken directly

927
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
or left implied, is that

928
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
vaccination must therefore be

929
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
equally suspect.

930
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
America's doctor, Sanjay Gupta, asks

931
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Anthony Fauci

932
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
about this exact

933
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
study, and whether he's considered

934
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
natural immunity as a

935
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
factor, and Fauci said, no, I haven't

936
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
really thought about that.

937
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
There was a study that came out of Israel about

938
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
natural immunity, and basically

939
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
the headline was that natural immunity

940
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
provides a lot of protection, even

941
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
better than the vaccines alone.

942
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
What are

943
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
people to make of that? So

944
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
as we talk about vaccine mandates,

945
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
I get calls all the time, people say, I've

946
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
already had COVID, I'm

947
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
protected, and now the study says, maybe

948
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
even more protected than the vaccine alone.

949
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Should they also get the vaccine?

950
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
How do you make the case to them?

951
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
You know, that's a really

952
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
good point, Sanjay. I don't have a really

953
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
firm answer for you on that.

954
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Which is absolutely absurd

955
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
that someone of Fauci's acumen

956
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
with his expertise would not

957
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
have considered this, and it really

958
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
is further evidence that he

959
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
will only consider

960
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
a big pharma-directed

961
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
solution, if we can even call it

962
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
a solution.

963
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Because he's not that much

964
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
of a hack, he's not that stupid, he knows

965
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
exactly what he's doing, and they

966
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
don't want to consider this

967
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
because it destroys

968
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
the big pharma agenda.

969
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
So that was journalist

970
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Max Blumenfall there, talking to

971
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Jimmy Dore in the video, Fauci

972
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
has no answer why vax people

973
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
with natural immunity, which

974
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
appears to show the medical advisor to the

975
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
president, Dr. Anthony Fauci, having

976
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
no answer to why people who have had

977
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
COVID before and recovered should

978
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
still get vaccinated. And Blumenfall

979
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
makes the case that this is a profit

980
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
motivated decision on behalf of

981
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
big pharma to sell more vaccines

982
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
or something. Except, that

983
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
clip was cut a little oddly there,

984
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm sure you noticed. You see,

985
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Fauci says he doesn't have a firm answer,

986
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
but then he does keep talking and

987
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
gives an answer to the question.

988
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
You know, that's a really good point, Sanjay.

989
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
I don't have a really firm answer for you

990
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
on that. That's something that we're

991
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
going to have to discuss regarding

992
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
the durability of the response. The one thing

993
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
the paper from Israel didn't

994
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
tell you is whether or not as high

995
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
as the protection is with

996
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
natural infection, what's the durability

997
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
compared to the durability

998
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
of a vaccine. So it is conceivable

999
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
that you got infected, you're protected,

1000
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
but you may not be protected for an

1001
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
indefinite period of time. So

1002
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
one reason that people who have had COVID before

1003
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
should still get vaccinated, Fauci

1004
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
argues, is because we aren't yet sure about

1005
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
the length of time immunity resulting

1006
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
from an infection of COVID might last.

1007
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
So in that case, it's still better

1008
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
to also get the vaccine just

1009
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
to be safe. Daw and Blumenfall

1010
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
used this one instance of Fauci

1011
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
saying he doesn't have a firm answer to

1012
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
imply that there are no firm answers to

1013
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
this question, beyond the greed of

1014
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
the pharmaceutical industry. But this

1015
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
is not the case. There are answers

1016
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
to this question, regardless of what

1017
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Fauci said in an interview one time.

1018
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
You know, are they actually interested

1019
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
in answering this question, or are they

1020
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
just trying to make Fauci look silly?

1021
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
So let's have a think about this

1022
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
question. Blumenfall and Daw

1023
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
make the case that a study came out

1024
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
that says so-called natural immunity

1025
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
is better than vaccine immunity, so

1026
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
why should people who have so-called

1027
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
natural immunity still get the vaccine?

1028
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
You know, beyond the one reason

1029
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
that we've already seen, that we aren't sure

1030
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
how long this immunity lasts.

1031
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Now firstly, I'd answer, there

1032
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
are undoubtedly a lot of people out there

1033
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
who think that they already caught

1034
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
COVID-19, but haven't.

1035
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
If someone you're in close contact with

1036
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
catches it and then you feel sick around

1037
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
the same time, you might just assume

1038
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
you have it too and not bother to get tested.

1039
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
But some of those cases are going

1040
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
to be colds, flus,

1041
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
or other illnesses. People who have

1042
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
misdiagnosed themselves with COVID-19

1043
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
and they're unknowingly

1044
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
walking around today with no

1045
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
immunity, air quotes, natural

1046
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
or otherwise. Secondly,

1047
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
tests for COVID can give

1048
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
false positives. There are also

1049
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
undoubtedly a lot of people walking around

1050
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
today who assume they've had COVID

1051
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
because they tested for it and received

1052
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
a false positive result.

1053
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Relative to the whole population, this won't

1054
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
be many people, but it will still be a

1055
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
significant amount. Thirdly,

1056
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
the study mentioned in Blumenfall and Daw's

1057
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
video, the one they used to argue that

1058
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
immunity from catching COVID is better

1059
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
than vaccine immunity might

1060
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
be wrong. Blumenfall

1061
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
mentions in the video that he tweeted

1062
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,400
about the article, so I went and

1063
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
found it, and here it is.

1064
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Bombshell preprint study of

1065
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
76,000 COVID subjects demonstrated

1066
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
that natural immunity,

1067
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
so on and so forth. Now, what you might notice

1068
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
here is the word preprint.

1069
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
The study mentioned is comparing

1070
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
SARS-CoV-2 natural

1071
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
immunity to vaccine-induced immunity,

1072
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
re-infections versus breakthrough

1073
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
infections, and if we go to where the study's

1074
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
hosted, right underneath the title it

1075
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
says, this article is a preprint

1076
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
and has not been peer reviewed.

1077
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
It reports new medical research

1078
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,400
that has yet to be evaluated and

1079
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
so should not be used to guide clinical

1080
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
practice. And if we click on that

1081
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
what does this mean link, we get a page

1082
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
explaining that preprint studies quote

1083
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
have yet to be evaluated by the medical

1084
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
community and the information presented

1085
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
may be erroneous. So this

1086
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
study compares individuals from

1087
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
three groups. Those who have had COVID

1088
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
and recovered from it but are not vaccinated,

1089
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
those who have had COVID and recovered

1090
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,400
from it and are vaccinated,

1091
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
and those who have just been vaccinated.

1092
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
And its findings,

1093
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
remember its early preprint

1094
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
not peer reviewed findings,

1095
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
are that so-called natural immunity

1096
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
is better than vaccine immunity

1097
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
alone. They come to this conclusion

1098
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
because they find more breakthrough cases

1099
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
reported from COVID tests in the vaccinated

1100
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
group than in the natural immunity

1101
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,400
group. So let's talk about a few

1102
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
ways a study like this might

1103
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
come to some incorrect or exaggerated

1104
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,400
conclusions.

1105
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Firstly there's the usual limitations.

1106
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,400
It only concerns one

1107
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
type of vaccine, it only concerns

1108
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
the delta variant of COVID

1109
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
and so on. But I want to think about possible

1110
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
differences in behavior between

1111
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
the groups that were compared.

1112
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
As the study itself says, our

1113
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
results might be affected by differences

1114
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
between the groups in terms of health behaviors

1115
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
such as social distancing

1116
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
and mask wearing, a possible

1117
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
confounder that was not assessed.

1118
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
And another health behavior that might

1119
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
bias the findings of a study like this

1120
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
is willingness to get retested

1121
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
for COVID. Because this

1122
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,400
study is reporting results largely

1123
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
from voluntary tests

1124
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,400
for COVID. It's possible that

1125
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,400
individuals who are vaccinated are

1126
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
more conscious of the public health,

1127
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
more personally concerned about

1128
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
catching COVID and passing it on

1129
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,400
and thus are more likely to get tested

1130
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,400
in the first place. Maybe people

1131
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,400
who have had COVID once and not bothered

1132
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,400
to get vaccinated are more likely

1133
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,400
to think that they don't have to bother

1134
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,400
with retesting for COVID either

1135
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,400
since they've already had it. A lot of

1136
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,400
asymptomatic or mild cases

1137
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
of COVID might therefore be being missed

1138
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
in one group but picked up in the

1139
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
other. And the study itself comments

1140
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
on the possibility of missing asymptomatic

1141
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
infections saying

1142
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Additionally, as this is an observational

1143
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
real world study where PCR

1144
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
screening was not performed by protocol,

1145
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,400
we might be underestimating

1146
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
asymptomatic infections as these

1147
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
individuals often do not get tested.

1148
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Also, if we attempt

1149
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
to use this study to dissuade

1150
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
vaccination, we commit a different

1151
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
type of sampling error.

1152
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Because in terms of whether or not you should get

1153
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
vaccinated, the groups being compared

1154
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
by the study are not fit for purpose.

1155
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,400
The study defines one group as

1156
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,400
previously infected individuals

1157
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,400
who have not been vaccinated.

1158
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,400
But for our purposes here,

1159
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,400
this isn't accurate.

1160
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
The group is actually previously

1161
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
infected individuals who have not been

1162
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
vaccinated and survived

1163
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
catching COVID the first time

1164
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
if you follow. If you're wanting

1165
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
to know if you should get vaccinated,

1166
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
this group is not a fair comparison to

1167
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,400
the vaccinated group because it's

1168
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
excluding those who caught COVID

1169
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
and did not recover. The

1170
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
individuals in this group have been filtered

1171
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
already. They've had to pass a relevant

1172
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
health check. That being, if you

1173
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
get COVID, will you die

1174
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
and therefore not be able to be

1175
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,400
retested in the future? Those

1176
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
at most risk if they catch COVID,

1177
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
you know, the people least likely to have

1178
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
asymptomatic cases, the people most

1179
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
likely to end up hospitalized,

1180
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
they've been excluded from this sample

1181
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,400
already. You can't compare these

1182
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
two groups by saying, look, the

1183
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
unvaccinated people are healthier, so

1184
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
get vaccinated because you're not

1185
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
counting all the unvaccinated people

1186
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
who aren't around to get retested.

1187
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Now, did these possible

1188
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
biasing factors actually influence

1189
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
the results of the study?

1190
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Well, I don't know, honestly.

1191
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
It's a preprint study. It hasn't been

1192
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
peer reviewed. But to be clear

1193
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
here, the study not being peer reviewed

1194
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,400
yet doesn't mean it's wrong, necessarily.

1195
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Preprint studies can be

1196
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
very useful, but what we can't

1197
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
do is say with any degree of certainty

1198
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,400
that it is correct. I wouldn't

1199
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
bet my life or my health on it

1200
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,400
being correct, and nor should

1201
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,400
anybody else. But for the sake of

1202
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,400
the argument, let's imagine this

1203
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
study is entirely correct.

1204
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Now, what would it mean if this

1205
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,400
study was entirely correct?

1206
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,400
Well, what it would mean is that if

1207
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
you aren't vaccinated, you should go and

1208
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
get vaccinated as soon as possible.

1209
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,400
Because the study didn't just compare

1210
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
people with natural immunity to people

1211
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
with vaccine immunity, it also

1212
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,400
looked at people who have both.

1213
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
And it found that people with both

1214
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
have the best protection.

1215
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
You don't even have to read the whole study to find this out.

1216
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
They put it right there in the conclusions.

1217
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Individuals who were both

1218
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
previously infected and

1219
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,400
given a single dose of the vaccine

1220
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,400
gained additional protection against

1221
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
the Delta variant. Max Blumenfall

1222
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
makes it sound like this is an either

1223
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,400
or situation. Either

1224
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
you have natural immunity, or you

1225
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
have vaccine immunity, and you can

1226
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
only have one. But this isn't

1227
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
how it works. You can both have caught

1228
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
COVID and gotten vaccinated.

1229
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
And this paper, even if it's

1230
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,400
right, comes to the conclusion that

1231
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
being vaccinated gives you

1232
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
additional protection. So

1233
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
why didn't Blumenfall tweet

1234
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,400
bombshell study shows being vaccinated

1235
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,400
gives additional protection against

1236
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,400
the Delta variant? Why

1237
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,400
vax people with natural immunity?

1238
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,400
Ask Blumenfall and Jimmy Dore. Well,

1239
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,400
I don't know. How about you actually

1240
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,400
read the paper that you cite

1241
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,400
in your video?

1242
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
That might be asking a bit much, though,

1243
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
on YouTube.

1244
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
Thanks a lot for watching today, folks.

1245
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,400
But before I go,

1246
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,400
a general disclaimer.

1247
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Please do not take medical advice

1248
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
from YouTube videos, particularly

1249
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
a ranty comedian's YouTube

1250
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,400
videos. As a YouTuber

1251
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
myself, I know hundreds of

1252
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
different ways that we can manipulate

1253
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,400
facts, present biased narratives,

1254
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,400
and just lie to you

1255
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
and get paid doing it.

1256
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,400
You don't even have to be that sneaky.

1257
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
99% of your audience will

1258
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
never go and confirm anything you

1259
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
say. You can just lie

1260
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
on here. There are no checks.

1261
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
We are bound to the truth by

1262
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
zero regulations.

1263
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
As long as we don't literally break the

1264
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,400
law, we can tell you anything

1265
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
we want with zero repercussions.

1266
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
And this goes for me, too,

1267
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,400
of course. All I can do is

1268
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,400
relay to you that medical experts

1269
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,400
and medical institutions overwhelmingly

1270
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
advise vaccination against COVID-19.

1271
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
And I would ask that

1272
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
if you're not vaccinated yet, you go

1273
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
and confirm that information, and

1274
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
so long as you're able, get

1275
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,400
vaccinated. Jimmy Dore likes

1276
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
to say that everyone will get COVID

1277
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,400
eventually, and in preparation for

1278
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,400
that, please get vaccinated.

1279
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,400
You are much less likely to end up

1280
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,400
hospitalized, and you are much less likely

1281
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,400
to end up dead from catching COVID-19

1282
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,400
if you are vaccinated.

1283
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
It's vastly safer,

1284
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
not just for you personally, but

1285
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
also for anyone you interact with.

1286
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
And for those who don't like needles,

1287
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,400
I completely understand. I

1288
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
don't like them either, but I've had

1289
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,400
two COVID-19 jabs so far

1290
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,400
and I honestly didn't even feel

1291
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,400
either one of them. And that's

1292
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
not because I'm so tough, by the way.

1293
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
I have a very low threshold

1294
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
for pain. Thank you,

1295
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,400
as always, to my patrons, who are

1296
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
lovely and should be scrolling by right now.

1297
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,400
I'll leave a link to my Patreon

1298
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
in the video description if you'd like to check it

1299
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,400
out. Right, that's all from me today,

1300
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,400
folks. I'll see you next time.
