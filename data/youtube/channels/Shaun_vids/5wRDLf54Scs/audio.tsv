0	5200	Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about anti-vaccine propaganda.
5200	10700	Now, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has obviously seen rise to a lot of discussion of vaccines,
10700	14800	and also, sadly, a lot of awful anti-vaccine arguments.
14800	20000	And for examples of how this sort of propaganda works, we're going to take a look at The Jimmy Dore Show.
20000	26300	Now, Jimmy Dore is a comedian and political commentator who hosts The Jimmy Dore Show here on YouTube,
26300	29600	on a channel with around 900,000 subscribers.
29600	36700	If you aren't familiar with The Jimmy Dore Show, Jimmy Dore styles himself as someone who critiques the political establishment,
36700	39300	including the Democrats, from the left.
39300	43400	And until recently, his commentary on vaccines followed that approach.
43400	47200	On December 21st of last year, Dore put out a video titled,
47200	50200	Vaccine for Elites, but Not for Nurses,
50200	56200	in which he expresses his anger that healthcare executives were getting vaccinated before frontline workers.
56300	60000	On April 30th of this year, Dore put out a video titled,
60000	63100	Bill Gates Denies Vaccine to Poor Countries,
63100	68500	in which he criticizes Gates for arguing in favor of patent protections on vaccines.
68500	72000	And on the 2nd of March of last year, he put out a video titled,
72000	78300	Pelosi, Corona Vaccine Should Be Affordable, WTF, where he says the following.
78300	80800	She wants to make the vaccines affordable.
80800	82800	She is a virus.
82800	87900	Yes, what kind of, you have to have a virus in your brain to think that, hey,
87900	90400	you know, we could, we could, well, here's what I said.
90400	95500	Of course, we could distribute the vaccine to all citizens as soon as it's available and stop a pandemic,
95500	97500	but we're not filthy socialists.
97500	100200	So lots of people are going to die.
100200	103600	That's what she's saying.
103600	112000	A functioning government would fucking inoculated citizenry against a goddamn pandemic and forget about a fucking profit motive.
112000	117500	So from these videos and others, Dore's position appears to be that vaccines are a good thing,
117500	121700	that they should be free, available to everyone regardless of status,
121700	128000	and that distributing the vaccine to all citizens as soon as it's available would stop the pandemic.
128000	133000	However, recently, something strange has been going on over at the Jimmy Dore show.
133000	140500	Dore has taken a hard turn into peddling anti-vaccine propaganda in videos that are absolutely full of deception,
140500	143600	flawed logic, and outright lies.
143600	149400	As for why this is, you only need to go to his channel and look at the view counts on his recent videos.
149400	154500	His anti-vaccine videos are some of the most popular content he's produced this year.
154500	162400	Bringing in a piece of the anti-vaccine audience provides a real financial incentive to keep producing that sort of content,
162400	168000	because some of those new viewers attracted by the anti-vaccine content will become premium members,
168000	176000	or head over to the Jimmy Dore Comedy Store, where they can buy mugs and hoodies and bags and hats and shirts and so on.
176000	177500	Now, you might say,
177500	179400	hold up there a second, Sean.
179400	181700	Maybe this is an unfair criticism.
181700	184700	Maybe this has nothing to do with money or chasing views.
184700	187100	Maybe this is just a coincidence.
187100	193700	Maybe Jimmy Dore just genuinely believes in the anti-vaccine arguments he feels compelled to share with the world.
193700	197200	Maybe he's just not had good counterarguments yet.
197200	200200	And I will admit that this is a possibility.
200200	202000	A slight possibility.
202000	205500	So, let's take a look at some of these arguments, then.
205500	207900	The first video I want to look at is titled,
207900	214600	Outbreak! 80% Vaccinated Singapore Has More Infections Than Ever, Released on October 6th.
214600	218900	This video features Dore reading out an article from Fortune.com titled,
218900	221800	Highly Vaccinated But More Cases Than Ever.
221800	227100	Singapore Shows The World What Endemic COVID Might Look Like, written by Grady McGregor.
227100	231600	And this video from Dore is a real masterclass in misleading an audience.
231600	237800	And to see what Dore does here, we're gonna read this article along with him and see how he represents it.
237800	239600	So, the article starts out,
239600	244800	highly vaccinated Singapore is battling a record wave of COVID-19 infections,
244800	247500	just as the city plans to reopen to the world.
247500	252300	But Singapore's 80% vaccination rate has kept severe cases and deaths down,
252300	259300	potentially proving that living with the virus versus trying to eradicate it is the surest path out of the pandemic.
259300	262500	Now, here's how Jimmy Dore starts reading the article.
264600	269800	On Monday, Singapore recorded 1,647 cases of COVID-19,
269800	275800	bringing its seven-day daily average to 1,545 cases,
275900	279400	higher than any other previous wave of the pandemic.
279400	282000	So what he did there was skip the first paragraph,
282000	286800	the one that states that Singapore's high vaccination rate has kept severe cases and deaths down,
286800	291800	and he started reading at the second paragraph, talking about the recent increase in COVID cases.
291800	296800	So he's avoided mentioning the positive effects of the high vaccination rate there.
296800	299300	But let's not draw any conclusions right now.
299300	302900	So, following this sentence read out by Dore, the article says,
302900	307200	But even as cases soar, COVID-19 deaths in Singapore have remained low.
307200	312200	The city's state of 5.7 million people has averaged three deaths per day in the last week.
312200	316200	Singapore's saving grace is its high vaccination coverage.
316200	318200	So let's hear Jimmy read that.
327200	329400	Uh, hang on, where is he?
329400	332700	Oh, he skipped down to here, the sentence that starts out,
335700	340700	So that's twice now that he's skipped mentioning the positive effects of vaccination.
340700	344200	Now, the sentence following this one also mentions Singapore's low death rate.
344200	344700	It says,
354700	356700	So, let's listen to Jimmy read that.
359700	364700	Singapore has now fully vaccinated over 80% of its population,
364700	367700	one of the highest rates in the world!
367700	369700	No, he's gone again.
369700	374700	Now he's back up here, having expertly dodged multiple separate instances of the article
374700	378200	directly praising Singapore's high vaccination rate.
378200	383700	The best that Jimmy Dore manages is showing this one reference to quote,
383700	386200	But he does not make clear, as the article does,
386500	390500	that this widespread immunity is due in large part to the high vaccination rate.
390500	393500	And this is how Jimmy reads out the rest of the article.
393500	396500	Well, no, he's not reading the article, really.
396500	401500	He's picking particular sentences out of it in order to present a biased view of it.
401500	406500	This is an article about how Singapore's high vaccination rate has kept deaths low
406500	410500	even as virus cases increase as the country eases lockdown restrictions.
410500	412500	It's a success story.
412800	416800	Jimmy Dore, by refusing to mention the positive effects of vaccination,
416800	420800	turns it into a scaremongering article about an increase in cases
420800	422800	in order to make the vaccine look ineffective.
422800	424800	Now, further down the article,
424800	428800	Jimmy Dore does something even worse than simply selectively quote the article.
428800	432800	He actually changes the text in order to better suit his argument.
432800	436800	So, first, let's read the relevant part of the article.
437100	441100	Throughout July and August, cases in Singapore ticked up to over 100 per day
441100	447100	after nearly a year of almost no infections due to the city's previous zero tolerance policy.
447100	451100	That policy included stay-at-home orders, intensive testing and contact tracing,
451100	453100	and a ban on foreign visitors.
453100	457100	This month, cases have risen exponentially from 180 on September 1st
457100	461100	to roughly 500 by mid-September and to nearly 1,500 this week.
461100	465100	On Monday, Singapore said that it would reintroduce some social distancing measures
465400	468400	including reducing dining groups from five to two people at restaurants
468400	471400	and directing companies to allow employees to work from home.
471400	474400	Singapore's government said the measures will be in place for at least one month
474400	476400	to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed
476400	480400	and to allow the city to scale up services to help infected patients recover at home.
480400	483400	So what's happened here, according to this article anyway,
483400	486400	is that Singapore had very strict lockdown measures
486400	489400	and a low number of coronavirus cases.
489400	492400	Once a large percentage of the country was vaccinated, however,
492700	494700	they started easing those lockdown measures
494700	498700	which led, of course, expectedly, to an increase in cases.
498700	501700	But since the country has a very high vaccination rate,
501700	503700	the number of deaths remained low.
503700	507700	The vaccine, of course, does not make you completely immune from catching the virus
507700	511700	but it does make it much, much less likely that you will develop serious symptoms
511700	514700	or die as a result of catching the virus.
514700	518700	However, Singapore is still wary of overloading its hospitals
518700	521700	so is planning to reintroduce lockdown measures as needed
521700	524000	in order to control the number of cases.
524000	526000	This all makes perfect sense.
526000	529000	Very strict lockdown orders, then a high vaccination rate,
529000	532000	then a lifting of those orders leading to increasing cases
532000	537000	with some orders reintroduced in order to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity.
537000	540000	This is not too hard to follow, you'd think.
540000	544000	But Singapore's growing caseload has raised alarms, nonetheless,
544000	548000	because of the speed at which cases have climbed.
548300	551300	Despite policies including stay-at-home orders,
551300	554300	intensive testing and contact tracing,
554300	557300	and a ban on foreign visitors,
557300	560300	and 80% of them are vaccinated,
560300	562300	they're having the biggest outbreak ever.
562300	565300	Now, sharp-eyed viewers will have noticed
565300	569300	that what Daw just read out is not what the article says.
569300	571300	And let's look at them side by side here.
571300	572300	The article says,
572600	576600	Throughout July and August, cases in Singapore ticked up to over 100 per day
576600	579600	after nearly a year of almost no infections
579600	582600	due to the city's previous zero tolerance policy.
582600	585600	Emphasis on the word previous there.
585600	586600	Then it goes on to say,
586600	589600	That policy included stay-at-home orders,
589600	591600	intensive testing and so on.
591600	593600	Jimmy Daw's text says,
593600	597600	The speed at which cases have climbed despite policies
597600	601600	including stay-at-home orders, intensive testing and so on.
601900	603900	He snips out the sentence,
603900	606900	making it clear that these policies were the previous policies,
606900	608900	the policies that were lifted,
608900	611900	and he puts the word despite in there.
611900	614900	Now, the word despite is not in this paragraph in the original article,
614900	618900	and this makes it seem like these policies are current, ongoing policies.
618900	623900	He's rewriting what the article says to make it say something different.
623900	625900	Now, I'd like to pause here and ask a question
625900	629900	to any fans of Jimmy Daw's content that might be watching this video.
630200	632200	Now, I know that the response to me saying
632200	635200	Jimmy Daw produces anti-vaccine content will be to say,
635200	636200	No, he doesn't.
636200	640200	Daw doesn't directly tell anyone not to get the vaccine.
640200	641200	He got the vaccine.
641200	644200	And he says that you can get the vaccine if you like.
644200	646200	You know, he's not anti-vaccine.
646200	648200	He's just asking questions.
648200	650200	He's just got some concerns.
650200	652200	He's just reporting the vaccine news.
652200	654200	Now, my question is, if this was true,
654200	657200	if Jimmy Daw really was just innocently asking questions
657200	659200	and provoking debate,
659500	661500	why does he need to lie?
661500	663500	Why is he selectively quoting the article
663500	666500	to avoid mentioning the positive effects of vaccination?
666500	669500	Why is he editing the text of the article
669500	671500	to make lockdown measures seem ineffective?
671500	673500	If he was just reporting the news,
673500	676500	he would just read out the article in full, right?
676500	678500	If he's just asking questions,
678500	679500	why not ask,
679500	683500	Why does Singapore have one of the lowest COVID death rates in the world?
683500	685500	And the answer is because Jimmy Daw
685500	688500	is trying to present a biased view of vaccines.
688800	690800	He is producing content specifically
690800	693800	to attempt to draw in an anti-vaccine audience.
693800	696800	He's just doing it with plausible deniability,
696800	698800	because he doesn't want to be banned by YouTube.
698800	700800	But let's be fair here.
700800	702800	Maybe you're thinking,
702800	704800	Well, okay, the way Jimmy Daw read out that one article
704800	706800	was a bit dodgy,
706800	708800	but I'm not ready to brand him a liar over it.
708800	710800	I need more evidence for that.
710800	712800	So, okay, how about this?
712800	714800	On the 14th of October,
714800	716800	the site healthfeedback.org
717100	719100	published an article that was critical
719100	721100	of Jimmy Daw's statements about COVID-19.
721100	723100	And in particular here,
723100	725100	we're interested in their criticism of his statements
725100	727100	about the drug ivermectin.
727100	729100	They say,
743100	745100	While it is true that ivermectin is used in humans
745400	747400	and that the scientist who discovered it
747400	749400	won a Nobel Prize,
749400	751400	what Daw didn't tell his viewers
751400	753400	was that neither of those facts have any bearing
753400	755400	on whether ivermectin is effective against COVID-19,
755400	757400	specifically.
757400	759400	Reliable studies haven't shown that ivermectin
759400	761400	is effective against COVID-19.
761400	763400	So, apparently, Jimmy Daw has been spreading
763400	765400	inaccurate information about ivermectin,
765400	767400	telling his audience
767400	769400	that ivermectin is effective in treating COVID,
769400	771400	which would be very irresponsible.
771400	773400	However,
773700	775700	in a video posted to YouTube on the 19th of October,
775700	777700	Jimmy Daw defended himself
777700	779700	against the claims in this article
779700	781700	by saying that they're all made up.
803400	805400	So, according to Jimmy Daw,
805400	807400	he's never said anything like the claims in the article.
807400	809400	He's never said ivermectin is effective in treating COVID.
809400	811400	However,
833400	835400	Uh-oh.
835400	837400	Now, if you go looking for that video
837400	839400	on Jimmy Daw's YouTube channel,
839400	841400	you won't find it.
841400	843400	It's actually specifically against
843400	845400	YouTube's content policies to post videos
845400	847400	that feature, quote,
847400	849400	categorical claims that ivermectin
849400	851400	is an effective treatment for COVID-19.
851400	853400	So, did YouTube delete that video?
853400	855400	Did Jimmy Daw take it down,
855400	857400	perhaps in preparation for COVID-19?
857400	859400	So, did YouTube delete that video?
859400	861400	Did Jimmy Daw take it down?
861400	863400	Perhaps in preparation to claim
863400	865400	that he never said exactly
865400	867400	what he did say in the video?
867400	869400	I don't know.
869400	871400	What Jimmy can't take down, though,
871400	873400	is his appearance on Joe Rogan's show.
873400	875400	So, what about, uh, like,
875400	877400	can we talk about ivermectin?
877400	879400	Yeah, sure.
879400	881400	So, I covered it,
881400	883400	what they did in Mexico City,
883400	885400	and ivermectin seems to be
885400	887400	a drug that not only treats it,
887400	889400	but it will prevent you from getting it.
889400	891400	Well, now, according to Jimmy Daw,
891400	893400	ivermectin doesn't just seem
893400	895400	like it treats COVID,
895400	897400	it will actually stop you from getting it
897400	899400	altogether. Now, if you watched that clip,
899400	901400	it's quite funny, because by making
901400	903400	such a direct medical claim,
903400	905400	he clearly worries Rogan a bit,
905400	907400	who starts saying, well, we need more studies,
907400	909400	you know, I'm just an MMA guy,
909400	911400	don't listen to me about health stuff.
911400	913400	Rogan's clearly also worried about the
913400	915400	wrath of the YouTube censors.
915400	917400	And speaking of, Jimmy Daw's
917400	919400	last video, YouTube's new censorship
919400	921400	rampage over vaccines,
921400	923400	starts out with Daw making a rather
923400	925400	embarrassing error.
925400	927400	And I wish I had Glenn Greenwald on to talk
927400	929400	about this with me, but the irony here
929400	931400	is that
931400	933400	inside this article,
933400	935400	talking about how YouTube's
935400	937400	gonna stop misinformation about vaccines,
937400	939400	it includes misinformation
939400	941400	about vaccines.
941400	943400	This is from the AP,
943400	945400	this will not be censored at
945400	947400	Twitter, this will not be censored at,
947400	949400	this is misinformation.
949400	951400	That is not true.
951400	953400	Scientists do not say
953400	955400	that the vaccines will end
955400	957400	the COVID-19 pandemic.
959400	961400	That is not what they say.
961400	963400	Do you want to know what they say?
963400	965400	COVID-19 won't be
965400	967400	eradicated. Who says that?
967400	969400	The who? The WHO.
969400	971400	The World Health
971400	973400	Organization says that.
973400	975400	The AP is misinforming
975400	977400	you. So do you understand
977400	979400	why there shouldn't be censorship ever?
979400	981400	So Daw first shows this article
981400	983400	from the AP which states that scientists
983400	985400	say public acceptance of
985400	987400	free immunizations will end the
987400	989400	COVID-19 pandemic.
989400	991400	Then he shows this article from TheHill.com
991400	993400	which states global health experts
993400	995400	say COVID-19 won't
995400	997400	be eradicated. Now Daw
997400	999400	treats these quotes as if they're contradictory
999400	1001400	and goes on for several minutes about
1001400	1003400	how this proves the press is lying to you
1003400	1005400	and you can't censor independent voices
1005400	1007400	like his, and so on.
1007400	1009400	However, he's made a mistake here
1009400	1011400	because these two quotes are not contradictory.
1011400	1013400	Ending the current
1013400	1015400	COVID-19 pandemic can be done
1015400	1017400	without eradicating COVID-19
1017400	1019400	because the word pandemic describes
1019400	1021400	the state, not the existence
1021400	1023400	of the virus. With sufficient
1023400	1025400	resistance to the virus, the worldwide pandemic
1025400	1027400	would end, even if the virus
1027400	1029400	itself continues to circulate.
1029400	1031400	And one of the best ways to increase a population's
1031400	1033400	resistance to the virus is
1033400	1035400	widespread vaccination. Now you'd
1035400	1037400	think Jimmy Daw would know this, since
1037400	1039400	as we saw earlier, he stated last
1039400	1041400	year that distributing the vaccine to
1041400	1043400	all citizens as soon as it's available
1043400	1045400	would stop the pandemic. Now this
1045400	1047400	either means that Jimmy Daw believes that
1047400	1049400	ending the pandemic necessarily entails
1049400	1051400	entirely wiping out the virus,
1051400	1053400	and I don't believe he's that clueless,
1053400	1055400	or it means that he did understand
1055400	1057400	that widespread vaccination could end
1057400	1059400	the pandemic as he stated, and he's
1059400	1061400	just decided to forget
1061400	1063400	that information, for some
1063400	1065400	reason. Next up, I want
1065400	1067400	to give an example of how bad scientific
1067400	1069400	practices can give rise to
1069400	1071400	anti-vaccine myths. So let's
1071400	1073400	start with the Jimmy Daw video study
1073400	1075400	Vaccines Being Administered Incorrectly,
1075400	1077400	and we will track this claim back
1077400	1079400	to the source. So in this video,
1079400	1081400	Jimmy Daw is arguing that the way
1081400	1083400	COVID-19 vaccines are administered
1083400	1085400	is incorrect and dangerous,
1085400	1087400	and he does this by watching and repeating
1087400	1089400	the arguments of a different YouTube video
1089400	1091400	that being inadvertent intravenous
1091400	1093400	injections from a YouTuber
1093400	1095400	called John Campbell. In that
1095400	1097400	video, Campbell is reading out the study
1097400	1099400	Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus
1099400	1101400	Disease 2019 MRNA
1101400	1103400	Vaccine Can Induce Acute
1103400	1105400	Myopericarditis in
1105400	1107400	Mouse Model. So what did this
1107400	1109400	study investigate? Well, the COVID-19
1109400	1111400	vaccine is an intramuscular
1111400	1113400	or IM injection,
1113400	1115400	meaning it's injected into a muscle,
1115400	1117400	typically the deltoid. This
1117400	1119400	study attempts to discover what would happen with
1119400	1121400	an intravenous or IV
1121400	1123400	injection of the vaccine, meaning it's injected
1123400	1125400	directly into the bloodstream.
1125400	1127400	So they injected some mice with
1127400	1129400	the vaccine, some with IM
1129400	1131400	injections, some with IV injections.
1131400	1133400	Later, they dissected
1133400	1135400	the mice, the poor
1135400	1137400	mice, and they report that they found
1137400	1139400	myopericarditis in the IV
1139400	1141400	group, myopericarditis
1141400	1143400	being an inflammation of parts of
1143400	1145400	the heart. So the conclusion this
1145400	1147400	far would seem to be that IV injection
1147400	1149400	of the vaccine can be bad for the heart.
1149400	1151400	Emphasis on seem
1151400	1153400	to be. Please do not actually
1153400	1155400	make any conclusions right now. Stick with
1155400	1157400	me to the end of this bit. Trust me, there
1157400	1159400	is a twist up ahead. Now of
1159400	1161400	course, in humans, the vaccine is
1161400	1163400	injected in a muscle and not
1163400	1165400	intravenously, so we might say
1165400	1167400	what's the problem, right? Just don't
1167400	1169400	inject it intravenously and we're okay.
1169400	1171400	But what the authors of this study
1171400	1173400	are concerned about is the possibility of
1173400	1175400	an accidental intravenous injection.
1175400	1177400	So the person administering
1177400	1179400	the injection aims to inject the vaccine
1179400	1181400	into a muscle but accidentally injects
1181400	1183400	it into the bloodstream. And
1183400	1185400	they recommend blood aspiration as a way
1185400	1187400	to avoid this possibility. Now
1187400	1189400	aspiration is the drawing back of the syringe
1189400	1191400	plunger after insertion to
1191400	1193400	check if any blood flows back into the
1193400	1195400	needle, basically. They recommend this
1195400	1197400	as a way for the person administering the vaccine
1197400	1199400	to make sure they're injecting in the right place.
1199400	1201400	However, the World Health Organization
1201400	1203400	and the Centers for Disease Control
1203400	1205400	and Prevention do not recommend
1205400	1207400	aspiration during the administration of the
1207400	1209400	vaccine because the size of the needle
1209400	1211400	and the size of the blood vessels at the site
1211400	1213400	of injection mean that it's an unnecessary
1213400	1215400	practice, they say. The CDC
1215400	1217400	guidance on vaccine administration
1217400	1219400	states that aspiration before
1219400	1221400	injection of vaccines or toxoids
1221400	1223400	is not necessary because no large
1223400	1225400	blood vessels are present at the recommended
1225400	1227400	injection sites. If this is
1227400	1229400	true, it means that there is no way to
1229400	1231400	accidentally replicate the sort
1231400	1233400	of intentional intravenous injection
1233400	1235400	seen in the experiment with the mice.
1235400	1237400	So since they consider it unnecessary
1237400	1239400	and it also leads to more painful
1239400	1241400	injections, they recommend against
1241400	1243400	it. Now it needs to be made very clear
1243400	1245400	here that this study did not find evidence
1245400	1247400	of accidental intravenous injections
1247400	1249400	of any COVID-19 vaccine.
1249400	1251400	That's not what the study was about.
1251400	1253400	They treated it as a hypothetical possibility
1253400	1255400	and then sought to investigate what would happen
1255400	1257400	as a result. For evidence
1257400	1259400	of the possibility of accidental
1259400	1261400	intravenous injection, they point to a study
1261400	1263400	called Blood Aspiration During
1263400	1265400	IM Injection, a self-reporting
1265400	1267400	study of nurses who were asked
1267400	1269400	questions about blood aspiration.
1269400	1271400	But I find this kind of tenuous.
1271400	1273400	That study concerns all
1273400	1275400	intramuscular medical injections,
1275400	1277400	not just vaccine injections,
1277400	1279400	in different parts of the body, not just
1279400	1281400	where vaccines are usually administered,
1281400	1283400	and it had an incredibly small
1283400	1285400	sample size, being quote,
1285400	1287400	limited to nurses in one small community
1287400	1289400	hospital and one state university.
1289400	1291400	The study did not survey all
1291400	1293400	the nurses in these settings. As a
1293400	1295400	result, the sample may not represent the
1295400	1297400	population of nurses practicing and
1297400	1299400	cannot be generalized. So what
1299400	1301400	do we have here then? Well, we have
1301400	1303400	one study arguing in favor of
1303400	1305400	aspiration during vaccine injections
1305400	1307400	versus the generally accepted guidelines
1307400	1309400	stating that it's unnecessary.
1309400	1311400	Phrasing this extremely generously
1311400	1313400	to the authors of the study, we could say that
1313400	1315400	some medical professionals recommend
1315400	1317400	aspiration for vaccine injections
1317400	1319400	and some don't. So how do we
1319400	1321400	get from here to Jimmy Dore stating
1321400	1323400	outright that they're administering
1323400	1325400	the jabs incorrectly?
1325400	1327400	And now we find out they're administering
1327400	1329400	the jabs incorrectly.
1329400	1331400	Jimmy Dore
1331400	1333400	has taken it upon himself to settle the
1333400	1335400	argument here, and he's done it seemingly
1335400	1337400	at random. He's picked the side that
1337400	1339400	agrees with him, funnily enough,
1339400	1341400	and said they're the ones who are correct
1341400	1343400	here, based upon no evidence
1343400	1345400	other than what he would like to be true
1345400	1347400	it seems. Now it might shock
1347400	1349400	you to hear this, but I disagree
1349400	1351400	with Jimmy Dore here. By itself
1351400	1353400	I don't find this study
1353400	1355400	credible, but unlike Jimmy Dore
1355400	1357400	I have an actual reason
1357400	1359400	for thinking that. So this
1359400	1361400	paper was linked on pubpia.com
1361400	1363400	which is a website for discussion and
1363400	1365400	review of scientific publications.
1365400	1367400	And the top comment is from Elizabeth
1367400	1369400	M. Bick. Now Elizabeth
1369400	1371400	Bick has a Wikipedia page, and allow me
1371400	1373400	to quote briefly from that.
1373400	1375400	Elizabeth Bick is a Dutch microbiologist
1375400	1377400	and scientific integrity consultant.
1377400	1379400	Bick is known for her work detecting
1379400	1381400	photo manipulation in scientific publications
1381400	1383400	and identifying over 4,000
1383400	1385400	potential cases of improper research
1385400	1387400	conduct. So Elizabeth Bick
1387400	1389400	and the other commenters on pubpia have some
1389400	1391400	concerns about this paper.
1391400	1393400	And allow me to relay a few of those.
1393400	1395400	Firstly, there's some discussion about
1395400	1397400	the amount of vaccine that the mice
1397400	1399400	were administered, with Bick estimating
1399400	1401400	that the mice received a dose that was
1401400	1403400	relative to their body weight between
1403400	1405400	50 and 500 times the
1405400	1407400	dose which is given to a human. However
1407400	1409400	another comment points out that due to
1409400	1411400	the metabolic differences between mice
1411400	1413400	and humans, the relative difference in
1413400	1415400	dosage wouldn't actually be that extreme.
1415400	1417400	However they still estimate that it would
1417400	1419400	be multiple times the dose given to a
1419400	1421400	human. Now I don't know anything
1421400	1423400	about the relative metabolic rates
1423400	1425400	of mice and men, I'm afraid.
1425400	1427400	So I'm gonna call this one a wash.
1427400	1429400	You know, it's a possible overdose. But I can't
1429400	1431400	say conclusively because I just don't
1431400	1433400	know. I have no way to fairly
1433400	1435400	decide one way or the other here.
1435400	1437400	So next up, and more conclusively,
1437400	1439400	the commenters claim the strain of
1439400	1441400	lab mice that were used in the study are
1441400	1443400	apparently prone to the sort of heart problems
1443400	1445400	that the study was looking for. And I quote
1445400	1447400	Pericardial fibrosis and
1447400	1449400	mineralization is a common background
1449400	1451400	finding in healthy Balb C
1451400	1453400	mice, as any pathologist with mouse
1453400	1455400	experience can attest.
1455400	1457400	The lesions shown in figures 1 and 2
1457400	1459400	show pericardial fibrosis and
1459400	1461400	calcification 1 or 2 days
1461400	1463400	after vaccination, which seems incredibly
1463400	1465400	fast. It usually takes 5
1465400	1467400	days to see this extent of fibrosis.
1467400	1469400	And other commenters chimed
1469400	1471400	in supporting these claims, with one
1471400	1473400	stating, this paper reports what appears
1473400	1475400	to be naturally occurring pericardial
1475400	1477400	lesions in Balb C mice.
1477400	1479400	It's essentially impossible to get such
1479400	1481400	advanced lesions in 1-2 days
1481400	1483400	post-injection. Now, if this
1483400	1485400	were true, if this study really is
1485400	1487400	just showing what were already existing
1487400	1489400	heart issues in these mice,
1489400	1491400	why is the study reporting that they were found
1491400	1493400	more often in the intravenous
1493400	1495400	group? What a mystery
1495400	1497400	we have here. Well, let's attempt to solve
1497400	1499400	it. And we'll start with a very basic
1499400	1501400	hypothesis.
1501400	1503400	What if the authors of this study
1503400	1505400	just mixed the mice up?
1505400	1507400	You know, what if it was that simple?
1507400	1509400	So, let's investigate, if
1509400	1511400	only to disprove this hypothesis.
1511400	1513400	Now, this study includes lots
1513400	1515400	of pictures of dead and dissected
1515400	1517400	mice, which do not worry, I will not
1517400	1519400	be showing here. What I will
1519400	1521400	be showing is scans of their heart
1521400	1523400	tissue, such as this one, figure
1523400	1525400	2, which shows, quote, blue
1525400	1527400	stained thickened visceral pericardium
1527400	1529400	over the right atrium and
1529400	1531400	ventricle at 1 dpi of IV
1531400	1533400	vaccine, which became more prominent
1533400	1535400	at 2 dpi, that's days
1535400	1537400	post-injection there. So,
1537400	1539400	this scan in figure 2a shows a
1539400	1541400	heart from the group which was given the intravenous
1541400	1543400	mRNA vaccine, and
1543400	1545400	the authors identify what they say are
1545400	1547400	problems with it. So, let's take
1547400	1549400	a look at how this compares to a scan of a
1549400	1551400	heart from the group of mice who were given the
1551400	1553400	intramuscular injection.
1553400	1555400	So, this is figure 5, from the section
1555400	1557400	titled, IM mRNA Vaccine
1557400	1559400	Administration Only Induced Mild
1559400	1561400	Myocardial Congestion and
1561400	1563400	Edema. And this particular scan
1563400	1565400	in figure 5c is from a mouse
1565400	1567400	who received an IM injection
1567400	1569400	instead of an IV injection
1569400	1571400	and thus has fewer heart problems
1571400	1573400	apparently. And let's take a look at these
1573400	1575400	side by side. So, IV
1575400	1577400	mouse on the left, IM
1577400	1579400	mouse on the right. Except,
1579400	1581400	and I've always wanted to
1581400	1583400	do this, computer
1583400	1585400	enhance, rotate
1585400	1587400	right image 115 degrees,
1587400	1589400	combine.
1589400	1591400	And, would you look at that,
1591400	1593400	this is the same image
1593400	1595400	right here. These heart scans are cited
1595400	1597400	both to show the damage caused by
1597400	1599400	intravenous injection and
1599400	1601400	the relative lack of damage caused by
1601400	1603400	intramuscular injection, but it's
1603400	1605400	the same scan. This is the
1605400	1607400	same mouse. So,
1607400	1609400	what happened here then? Well,
1609400	1611400	to put it in scientific terms,
1611400	1613400	they balled it up. This
1613400	1615400	same sample is marked both IV
1615400	1617400	vaccine 2dpi and
1617400	1619400	IM vaccine 2dpi,
1619400	1621400	which were the two groups the study was
1621400	1623400	seeking to compare. So, they've
1623400	1625400	mixed something up somewhere, clearly.
1625400	1627400	And props to Elizabeth Bick and
1627400	1629400	the commenters over at Pubpia for
1629400	1631400	spotting this, of course. Now, what
1631400	1633400	this means is that the results of this
1633400	1635400	study are suspect now.
1635400	1637400	How many other samples did the authors
1637400	1639400	of this study accidentally put in the wrong
1639400	1641400	groups? I don't know,
1641400	1643400	and nor does John Campbell or
1643400	1645400	Jimmy Dore. All we can conclusively
1645400	1647400	learn from this study is that the study should
1647400	1649400	probably be performed again.
1649400	1651400	Now, to be fair, you might argue
1651400	1653400	that maybe I'm overplaying this
1653400	1655400	one mistake. After all, it is
1655400	1657400	only one mistake, and
1657400	1659400	another counterargument could be that the
1659400	1661400	strain of mouse doesn't matter too much either,
1661400	1663400	even if they are prone to heart
1663400	1665400	problems, because with a large enough sample
1665400	1667400	size, those problems and
1667400	1669400	the occasional mistake wouldn't
1669400	1671400	impact the overall data
1671400	1673400	too much. It would all come out in
1673400	1675400	the wash. So, what
1675400	1677400	sort of group sizes are we
1677400	1679400	looking at with these mice? Well,
1679400	1681400	six
1681400	1683400	mice, for instance, in the
1683400	1685400	2DPI-IM group.
1685400	1687400	So, and this is something
1687400	1689400	important to remember beyond this one study
1689400	1691400	by the way, if you ever hear that
1691400	1693400	this or that was found in 50%
1693400	1695400	of tested mice, that
1695400	1697400	could be only three mice,
1697400	1699400	one of which in this particular study
1699400	1701400	ended up in the wrong group somehow.
1701400	1703400	What we're seeing here is bad science
1703400	1705400	getting picked up and repeated by
1705400	1707400	anti-vaccine propagandists.
1707400	1709400	Jimmy Dore and John Campbell
1709400	1711400	between them have 2 million YouTube
1711400	1713400	subscribers, and their videos using
1713400	1715400	this study to claim vaccines are being
1715400	1717400	administered incorrectly have hundreds
1717400	1719400	of thousands of views. And
1719400	1721400	a lot of those viewers are gonna go away, and all
1721400	1723400	they'll remember and possibly repeat to
1723400	1725400	other people is, well, I saw a video
1725400	1727400	about a study that said vaccines
1727400	1729400	damage your heart. Pointing out
1729400	1731400	the fact that there were major problems with the
1731400	1733400	study is all well and good, but it feels
1733400	1735400	like the damage has already been done at this
1735400	1737400	point. Now, just to be clear
1737400	1739400	here, this study is rubbish,
1739400	1741400	but I don't mean to give the impression
1741400	1743400	that an accidental intravenous injection
1743400	1745400	is completely impossible.
1745400	1747400	Of course, as with all medical procedures,
1747400	1749400	mistakes can and do happen.
1749400	1751400	And with millions of
1751400	1753400	vaccinations being carried out, it would be unreasonable
1753400	1755400	to assume that no mistakes occur
1755400	1757400	anywhere. And if some more
1757400	1759400	rigorous studies than this one led to a change
1759400	1761400	in the way the medical community at large
1761400	1763400	administers vaccines, I would have
1763400	1765400	no criticism of that. And
1765400	1767400	if further, even more rigorous
1767400	1769400	studies were then carried out and the medical
1769400	1771400	community changed back to the current
1771400	1773400	way of administering vaccines, I'd
1773400	1775400	have no criticism of that either.
1775400	1777400	Medical science, like all
1777400	1779400	science, changes and updates
1779400	1781400	as we learn new information. It's not
1781400	1783400	some hypocrisy, it's not some
1783400	1785400	trick being played on us, it's just
1785400	1787400	the way science happens.
1787400	1789400	Anyway, let's move on and look at another
1789400	1791400	video. So this is
1791400	1793400	Vax Side Effect, Sudden Hearing
1793400	1795400	Loss Reported. And here, Jimmy
1795400	1797400	Dore falls into that most classic
1797400	1799400	of argumentative pitfalls,
1799400	1801400	the correlation versus causation
1801400	1803400	misunderstanding. So, the
1803400	1805400	portion of this video that is actually about
1805400	1807400	hearing loss is mostly just Dore
1807400	1809400	watching a news report from ABC15
1809400	1811400	about some people who reported
1811400	1813400	experiencing tinnitus after being
1813400	1815400	vaccinated against COVID-19.
1815400	1817400	A lot of Dore's videos
1817400	1819400	consist of him just watching other
1819400	1821400	videos and making faces at them actually.
1843400	1845400	Now then, we need
1845400	1847400	to be careful and responsible
1847400	1849400	when investigating and reporting
1849400	1851400	this sort of thing. You see,
1851400	1853400	the issue here is one of scale.
1853400	1855400	It might be that you can find
1855400	1857400	217 people in
1857400	1859400	Arizona, say, who reported
1859400	1861400	tinnitus after being vaccinated.
1861400	1863400	But Arizona has a population
1863400	1865400	of millions of people,
1865400	1867400	and if an area's healthcare system
1867400	1869400	vaccinates millions of people, that
1869400	1871400	is a huge data set to pull from.
1871400	1873400	And tinnitus can have several possible
1873400	1875400	causes. Sinus congestion,
1875400	1877400	stress, anxiety,
1877400	1879400	high blood pressure, and so on.
1879400	1881400	Out of millions of people,
1881400	1883400	we'd expect some of those people
1883400	1885400	to report tinnitus anyway
1885400	1887400	on just an average week with no
1887400	1889400	vaccinations whatsoever.
1889400	1891400	So, this could just be a coincidence,
1891400	1893400	right? They could be incorrectly
1893400	1895400	identifying the cause of their
1895400	1897400	tinnitus as the recent vaccination
1897400	1899400	due to nothing more than unfortunate
1899400	1901400	timing. And let's do
1901400	1903400	a thought experiment here.
1903400	1905400	Let's imagine that millions of people
1905400	1907400	in a country are asked to go to a medical
1907400	1909400	facility and have a doctor or nurse
1909400	1911400	click their fingers in front
1911400	1913400	of that person's face.
1913400	1915400	That's all, then they leave and go
1915400	1917400	about their lives. So, the
1917400	1919400	basic framework of how we're currently
1919400	1921400	vaccinating people only without the
1921400	1923400	vaccinations, just a finger click.
1923400	1925400	Now, of those millions
1925400	1927400	of people, some of them will
1927400	1929400	develop tinnitus in the following week.
1929400	1931400	Some of them will experience
1931400	1933400	headaches, some of them will have a
1933400	1935400	heart attack or a stroke, and some
1935400	1937400	of them will die. But none of
1937400	1939400	that will have anything at all to do with
1939400	1941400	the finger click. It would be a coincidence.
1941400	1943400	Because we have millions of people
1943400	1945400	experiencing an event, we have
1945400	1947400	millions of chances for tinnitus
1947400	1949400	and headaches and heart attacks
1949400	1951400	to happen. But people, as a rule,
1951400	1953400	aren't very good at thinking in terms
1953400	1955400	of very large numbers. You'd
1955400	1957400	only need a dozen or so people having
1957400	1959400	heart attacks within a week of the finger click
1959400	1961400	to build an alarmist narrative about
1961400	1963400	finger clicks causing heart attacks
1963400	1965400	or whatever. But they wouldn't,
1965400	1967400	of course, it would be entirely coincidental.
1967400	1969400	What you would need to start
1969400	1971400	to prove a link between finger clicks and
1971400	1973400	heart attacks is an elevated
1973400	1975400	number of heart attacks relative to
1975400	1977400	what we would usually expect.
1977400	1979400	By itself, any one case
1979400	1981400	is just anecdotal evidence.
1981400	1983400	For instance, Nicki Minaj's cousin's
1983400	1985400	friend says his testicles swelled
1985400	1987400	up after getting vaccinated.
1987400	1989400	Does that anecdotal evidence
1989400	1991400	prove that vaccines make your
1991400	1993400	testicles swell? No,
1993400	1995400	it doesn't. By themselves, Nicki
1995400	1997400	Minaj's cousin's friend's giant
1997400	1999400	balls can't tell us anything about the
1999400	2001400	COVID-19 vaccine. When
2001400	2003400	reporting things like this, it's better to
2003400	2005400	cite actual medical studies looking
2005400	2007400	for a direct link between vaccines
2007400	2009400	and various symptoms instead
2009400	2011400	of relying on individual anecdotal
2011400	2013400	evidence. It's also not good
2013400	2015400	to put that anecdotal evidence in a video
2015400	2017400	titled, Vax Side Effect
2017400	2019400	as if it's already been settled.
2019400	2021400	Now, I'm sure that right now you're
2021400	2023400	all saying, hold up there, Sean.
2023400	2025400	COVID-19, as a
2025400	2027400	respiratory illness, can cause sinus
2027400	2029400	problems and therefore tinnitus.
2029400	2031400	And it does so at much higher rates than
2031400	2033400	among those who reported tinnitus after
2033400	2035400	being vaccinated. And this is especially
2035400	2037400	true of the Delta variant, which has been
2037400	2039400	shown to more greatly affect the upper
2039400	2041400	respiratory tract. So this is all moot,
2041400	2043400	right? If you want to avoid getting
2043400	2045400	tinnitus, it's still better to be
2045400	2047400	vaccinated than not. And you're
2047400	2049400	right to say all that. Well done.
2049400	2051400	A few anecdotal cases of
2051400	2053400	tinnitus not proven to be linked to the
2053400	2055400	vaccine is no argument whatsoever
2055400	2057400	against the vaccine. It does
2057400	2059400	not stand up to scrutiny.
2059400	2061400	But here's where we need to talk about the way in
2061400	2063400	which conspiracy theories are delivered
2063400	2065400	from the conspiracy theorist
2065400	2067400	to their audience, which is what is
2067400	2069400	happening here. Because the issue
2069400	2071400	is that this video is not supposed
2071400	2073400	to stand up to scrutiny.
2073400	2075400	None of these videos are supposed to
2075400	2077400	stand up to scrutiny. They're all
2077400	2079400	meant to be only a single piece of evidence
2079400	2081400	in this. An
2081400	2083400	overwhelming barrage of
2083400	2085400	relentless sort of evidence.
2085400	2087400	It doesn't matter if you
2087400	2089400	disprove one piece of evidence
2089400	2091400	because there's just so much of it
2091400	2093400	and all of it comes with plausible
2093400	2095400	deniability. Jimmy Dawes
2095400	2097400	grift works by producing an extremely
2097400	2099400	large amount of air quotes
2099400	2101400	evidence. None of which, when
2101400	2103400	examined closely, will stand up.
2103400	2105400	But taken together, it gives
2105400	2107400	the impression that there must be
2107400	2109400	some sort of point here, right?
2109400	2111400	This is the quantity, not
2111400	2113400	quality style of argument.
2113400	2115400	If you don't like one argument, I've
2115400	2117400	got another. And if you don't like that
2117400	2119400	argument, I've got another. And
2119400	2121400	so on and so forth until you just
2121400	2123400	run out of energy to refute all of
2123400	2125400	this. And if you ever do manage to
2125400	2127400	pin the conspiracy theorist down on one
2127400	2129400	particular irrefutable point,
2129400	2131400	they'll just lie and claim they
2131400	2133400	never said what they said. Like
2133400	2135400	we saw Jimmy Dawe do with his statements
2135400	2137400	about ivermectin. And
2137400	2139400	unfortunately, one result of anti-vaccine
2139400	2141400	propaganda like this is that misled
2141400	2143400	people end up getting seriously
2143400	2145400	sick and possibly dying.
2145400	2147400	And here, I'd like to be careful
2147400	2149400	to make a distinction between anti-vaccine
2149400	2151400	propagandists and people who
2151400	2153400	I guess we call vaccine-hesitant.
2153400	2155400	The majority of vaccinated people
2155400	2157400	fall into the vaccine-hesitant camp.
2157400	2159400	They aren't committed to opposing
2159400	2161400	vaccines, they just aren't sure
2161400	2163400	what is the safest course of action.
2163400	2165400	Of course, the safest course of action
2165400	2167400	is to be vaccinated, and the
2167400	2169400	vaccine-hesitant have undoubtedly heard
2169400	2171400	a lot of positive things about vaccines,
2171400	2173400	but they've also probably heard a fair
2173400	2175400	few vaccine lies, like those given
2175400	2177400	a platform by people like Jimmy Dawe.
2177400	2179400	Now, Dawe himself isn't even
2179400	2181400	pushing anti-vaccine conspiracies
2181400	2183400	for ideological reasons, I don't think.
2183400	2185400	I don't think he actually has any
2185400	2187400	opinions, to be honest. He's just someone
2187400	2189400	who's willing to cash in on a trend,
2189400	2191400	even if it ends up getting people killed.
2191400	2193400	Anyway, one way the vaccine-
2193400	2195400	hesitant group is targeted by
2195400	2197400	the propagandists is by exploiting
2197400	2199400	a distrust of authority.
2199400	2201400	Vaccine-hesitant people might not have
2201400	2203400	much trust in the political system in which
2203400	2205400	they live, and that can be for very
2205400	2207400	valid reasons. Beyond the usual
2207400	2209400	reasons to distrust people in power,
2209400	2211400	with regards to the pandemic, we've
2211400	2213400	seen them giving inaccurate or contradictory
2213400	2215400	medical advice, making
2215400	2217400	promises they can't keep, not
2217400	2219400	following their own lockdown regulations,
2219400	2221400	and so on. There is a lot
2221400	2223400	to criticize there. And there's also
2223400	2225400	a lot to criticize the pharmaceutical
2225400	2227400	industry for, and this is particularly
2227400	2229400	true in the United States, where there is
2229400	2231400	an entirely understandable skepticism
2231400	2233400	of their for-profit healthcare
2233400	2235400	system. So it's easy for the
2235400	2237400	propagandists to point to all this hypocrisy,
2237400	2239400	corruption, and incompetence,
2239400	2241400	and then try to marry that
2241400	2243400	to the science of vaccination.
2243400	2245400	See, these powerful people
2245400	2247400	are clueless, and corrupt, and
2247400	2249400	untrustworthy, and they're telling
2249400	2251400	you to get vaccinated. So the
2251400	2253400	conclusion, either spoken directly
2253400	2255400	or left implied, is that
2255400	2257400	vaccination must therefore be
2257400	2259400	equally suspect.
2259400	2261400	America's doctor, Sanjay Gupta, asks
2261400	2263400	Anthony Fauci
2263400	2265400	about this exact
2265400	2267400	study, and whether he's considered
2267400	2269400	natural immunity as a
2269400	2271400	factor, and Fauci said, no, I haven't
2271400	2273400	really thought about that.
2273400	2275400	There was a study that came out of Israel about
2275400	2277400	natural immunity, and basically
2277400	2279400	the headline was that natural immunity
2279400	2281400	provides a lot of protection, even
2281400	2283400	better than the vaccines alone.
2283400	2285400	What are
2285400	2287400	people to make of that? So
2287400	2289400	as we talk about vaccine mandates,
2289400	2291400	I get calls all the time, people say, I've
2291400	2293400	already had COVID, I'm
2293400	2295400	protected, and now the study says, maybe
2295400	2297400	even more protected than the vaccine alone.
2297400	2299400	Should they also get the vaccine?
2299400	2301400	How do you make the case to them?
2301400	2303400	You know, that's a really
2303400	2305400	good point, Sanjay. I don't have a really
2305400	2307400	firm answer for you on that.
2307400	2309400	Which is absolutely absurd
2309400	2311400	that someone of Fauci's acumen
2311400	2313400	with his expertise would not
2313400	2315400	have considered this, and it really
2315400	2317400	is further evidence that he
2317400	2319400	will only consider
2319400	2321400	a big pharma-directed
2321400	2323400	solution, if we can even call it
2323400	2325400	a solution.
2325400	2327400	Because he's not that much
2327400	2329400	of a hack, he's not that stupid, he knows
2329400	2331400	exactly what he's doing, and they
2331400	2333400	don't want to consider this
2333400	2335400	because it destroys
2335400	2337400	the big pharma agenda.
2337400	2339400	So that was journalist
2339400	2341400	Max Blumenfall there, talking to
2341400	2343400	Jimmy Dore in the video, Fauci
2343400	2345400	has no answer why vax people
2345400	2347400	with natural immunity, which
2347400	2349400	appears to show the medical advisor to the
2349400	2351400	president, Dr. Anthony Fauci, having
2351400	2353400	no answer to why people who have had
2353400	2355400	COVID before and recovered should
2355400	2357400	still get vaccinated. And Blumenfall
2357400	2359400	makes the case that this is a profit
2359400	2361400	motivated decision on behalf of
2361400	2363400	big pharma to sell more vaccines
2363400	2365400	or something. Except, that
2365400	2367400	clip was cut a little oddly there,
2367400	2369400	I'm sure you noticed. You see,
2369400	2371400	Fauci says he doesn't have a firm answer,
2371400	2373400	but then he does keep talking and
2373400	2375400	gives an answer to the question.
2375400	2377400	You know, that's a really good point, Sanjay.
2377400	2379400	I don't have a really firm answer for you
2379400	2381400	on that. That's something that we're
2381400	2383400	going to have to discuss regarding
2383400	2385400	the durability of the response. The one thing
2385400	2387400	the paper from Israel didn't
2387400	2389400	tell you is whether or not as high
2389400	2391400	as the protection is with
2391400	2393400	natural infection, what's the durability
2393400	2395400	compared to the durability
2395400	2397400	of a vaccine. So it is conceivable
2397400	2399400	that you got infected, you're protected,
2399400	2401400	but you may not be protected for an
2401400	2403400	indefinite period of time. So
2403400	2405400	one reason that people who have had COVID before
2405400	2407400	should still get vaccinated, Fauci
2407400	2409400	argues, is because we aren't yet sure about
2409400	2411400	the length of time immunity resulting
2411400	2413400	from an infection of COVID might last.
2413400	2415400	So in that case, it's still better
2415400	2417400	to also get the vaccine just
2417400	2419400	to be safe. Daw and Blumenfall
2419400	2421400	used this one instance of Fauci
2421400	2423400	saying he doesn't have a firm answer to
2423400	2425400	imply that there are no firm answers to
2425400	2427400	this question, beyond the greed of
2427400	2429400	the pharmaceutical industry. But this
2429400	2431400	is not the case. There are answers
2431400	2433400	to this question, regardless of what
2433400	2435400	Fauci said in an interview one time.
2435400	2437400	You know, are they actually interested
2437400	2439400	in answering this question, or are they
2439400	2441400	just trying to make Fauci look silly?
2441400	2443400	So let's have a think about this
2443400	2445400	question. Blumenfall and Daw
2445400	2447400	make the case that a study came out
2447400	2449400	that says so-called natural immunity
2449400	2451400	is better than vaccine immunity, so
2451400	2453400	why should people who have so-called
2453400	2455400	natural immunity still get the vaccine?
2455400	2457400	You know, beyond the one reason
2457400	2459400	that we've already seen, that we aren't sure
2459400	2461400	how long this immunity lasts.
2461400	2463400	Now firstly, I'd answer, there
2463400	2465400	are undoubtedly a lot of people out there
2465400	2467400	who think that they already caught
2467400	2469400	COVID-19, but haven't.
2469400	2471400	If someone you're in close contact with
2471400	2473400	catches it and then you feel sick around
2473400	2475400	the same time, you might just assume
2475400	2477400	you have it too and not bother to get tested.
2477400	2479400	But some of those cases are going
2479400	2481400	to be colds, flus,
2481400	2483400	or other illnesses. People who have
2483400	2485400	misdiagnosed themselves with COVID-19
2485400	2487400	and they're unknowingly
2487400	2489400	walking around today with no
2489400	2491400	immunity, air quotes, natural
2491400	2493400	or otherwise. Secondly,
2493400	2495400	tests for COVID can give
2495400	2497400	false positives. There are also
2497400	2499400	undoubtedly a lot of people walking around
2499400	2501400	today who assume they've had COVID
2501400	2503400	because they tested for it and received
2503400	2505400	a false positive result.
2505400	2507400	Relative to the whole population, this won't
2507400	2509400	be many people, but it will still be a
2509400	2511400	significant amount. Thirdly,
2511400	2513400	the study mentioned in Blumenfall and Daw's
2513400	2515400	video, the one they used to argue that
2515400	2517400	immunity from catching COVID is better
2517400	2519400	than vaccine immunity might
2519400	2521400	be wrong. Blumenfall
2521400	2523400	mentions in the video that he tweeted
2523400	2525400	about the article, so I went and
2525400	2527400	found it, and here it is.
2527400	2529400	Bombshell preprint study of
2529400	2531400	76,000 COVID subjects demonstrated
2531400	2533400	that natural immunity,
2533400	2535400	so on and so forth. Now, what you might notice
2535400	2537400	here is the word preprint.
2537400	2539400	The study mentioned is comparing
2539400	2541400	SARS-CoV-2 natural
2541400	2543400	immunity to vaccine-induced immunity,
2543400	2545400	re-infections versus breakthrough
2545400	2547400	infections, and if we go to where the study's
2547400	2549400	hosted, right underneath the title it
2549400	2551400	says, this article is a preprint
2551400	2553400	and has not been peer reviewed.
2553400	2555400	It reports new medical research
2555400	2557400	that has yet to be evaluated and
2557400	2559400	so should not be used to guide clinical
2559400	2561400	practice. And if we click on that
2561400	2563400	what does this mean link, we get a page
2563400	2565400	explaining that preprint studies quote
2565400	2567400	have yet to be evaluated by the medical
2567400	2569400	community and the information presented
2569400	2571400	may be erroneous. So this
2571400	2573400	study compares individuals from
2573400	2575400	three groups. Those who have had COVID
2575400	2577400	and recovered from it but are not vaccinated,
2577400	2579400	those who have had COVID and recovered
2579400	2581400	from it and are vaccinated,
2581400	2583400	and those who have just been vaccinated.
2583400	2585400	And its findings,
2585400	2587400	remember its early preprint
2587400	2589400	not peer reviewed findings,
2589400	2591400	are that so-called natural immunity
2591400	2593400	is better than vaccine immunity
2593400	2595400	alone. They come to this conclusion
2595400	2597400	because they find more breakthrough cases
2597400	2599400	reported from COVID tests in the vaccinated
2599400	2601400	group than in the natural immunity
2601400	2603400	group. So let's talk about a few
2603400	2605400	ways a study like this might
2605400	2607400	come to some incorrect or exaggerated
2607400	2609400	conclusions.
2609400	2611400	Firstly there's the usual limitations.
2611400	2613400	It only concerns one
2613400	2615400	type of vaccine, it only concerns
2615400	2617400	the delta variant of COVID
2617400	2619400	and so on. But I want to think about possible
2619400	2621400	differences in behavior between
2621400	2623400	the groups that were compared.
2623400	2625400	As the study itself says, our
2625400	2627400	results might be affected by differences
2627400	2629400	between the groups in terms of health behaviors
2629400	2631400	such as social distancing
2631400	2633400	and mask wearing, a possible
2633400	2635400	confounder that was not assessed.
2635400	2637400	And another health behavior that might
2637400	2639400	bias the findings of a study like this
2639400	2641400	is willingness to get retested
2641400	2643400	for COVID. Because this
2643400	2645400	study is reporting results largely
2645400	2647400	from voluntary tests
2647400	2649400	for COVID. It's possible that
2649400	2651400	individuals who are vaccinated are
2651400	2653400	more conscious of the public health,
2653400	2655400	more personally concerned about
2655400	2657400	catching COVID and passing it on
2657400	2659400	and thus are more likely to get tested
2659400	2661400	in the first place. Maybe people
2661400	2663400	who have had COVID once and not bothered
2663400	2665400	to get vaccinated are more likely
2665400	2667400	to think that they don't have to bother
2667400	2669400	with retesting for COVID either
2669400	2671400	since they've already had it. A lot of
2671400	2673400	asymptomatic or mild cases
2673400	2675400	of COVID might therefore be being missed
2675400	2677400	in one group but picked up in the
2677400	2679400	other. And the study itself comments
2679400	2681400	on the possibility of missing asymptomatic
2681400	2683400	infections saying
2683400	2685400	Additionally, as this is an observational
2685400	2687400	real world study where PCR
2687400	2689400	screening was not performed by protocol,
2689400	2691400	we might be underestimating
2691400	2693400	asymptomatic infections as these
2693400	2695400	individuals often do not get tested.
2695400	2697400	Also, if we attempt
2697400	2699400	to use this study to dissuade
2699400	2701400	vaccination, we commit a different
2701400	2703400	type of sampling error.
2703400	2705400	Because in terms of whether or not you should get
2705400	2707400	vaccinated, the groups being compared
2707400	2709400	by the study are not fit for purpose.
2709400	2711400	The study defines one group as
2711400	2713400	previously infected individuals
2713400	2715400	who have not been vaccinated.
2715400	2717400	But for our purposes here,
2717400	2719400	this isn't accurate.
2719400	2721400	The group is actually previously
2721400	2723400	infected individuals who have not been
2723400	2725400	vaccinated and survived
2725400	2727400	catching COVID the first time
2727400	2729400	if you follow. If you're wanting
2729400	2731400	to know if you should get vaccinated,
2731400	2733400	this group is not a fair comparison to
2733400	2735400	the vaccinated group because it's
2735400	2737400	excluding those who caught COVID
2737400	2739400	and did not recover. The
2739400	2741400	individuals in this group have been filtered
2741400	2743400	already. They've had to pass a relevant
2743400	2745400	health check. That being, if you
2745400	2747400	get COVID, will you die
2747400	2749400	and therefore not be able to be
2749400	2751400	retested in the future? Those
2751400	2753400	at most risk if they catch COVID,
2753400	2755400	you know, the people least likely to have
2755400	2757400	asymptomatic cases, the people most
2757400	2759400	likely to end up hospitalized,
2759400	2761400	they've been excluded from this sample
2761400	2763400	already. You can't compare these
2763400	2765400	two groups by saying, look, the
2765400	2767400	unvaccinated people are healthier, so
2767400	2769400	get vaccinated because you're not
2769400	2771400	counting all the unvaccinated people
2771400	2773400	who aren't around to get retested.
2773400	2775400	Now, did these possible
2775400	2777400	biasing factors actually influence
2777400	2779400	the results of the study?
2779400	2781400	Well, I don't know, honestly.
2781400	2783400	It's a preprint study. It hasn't been
2783400	2785400	peer reviewed. But to be clear
2785400	2787400	here, the study not being peer reviewed
2787400	2789400	yet doesn't mean it's wrong, necessarily.
2789400	2791400	Preprint studies can be
2791400	2793400	very useful, but what we can't
2793400	2795400	do is say with any degree of certainty
2795400	2797400	that it is correct. I wouldn't
2797400	2799400	bet my life or my health on it
2799400	2801400	being correct, and nor should
2801400	2803400	anybody else. But for the sake of
2803400	2805400	the argument, let's imagine this
2805400	2807400	study is entirely correct.
2807400	2809400	Now, what would it mean if this
2809400	2811400	study was entirely correct?
2811400	2813400	Well, what it would mean is that if
2813400	2815400	you aren't vaccinated, you should go and
2815400	2817400	get vaccinated as soon as possible.
2817400	2819400	Because the study didn't just compare
2819400	2821400	people with natural immunity to people
2821400	2823400	with vaccine immunity, it also
2823400	2825400	looked at people who have both.
2825400	2827400	And it found that people with both
2827400	2829400	have the best protection.
2829400	2831400	You don't even have to read the whole study to find this out.
2831400	2833400	They put it right there in the conclusions.
2833400	2835400	Individuals who were both
2835400	2837400	previously infected and
2837400	2839400	given a single dose of the vaccine
2839400	2841400	gained additional protection against
2841400	2843400	the Delta variant. Max Blumenfall
2843400	2845400	makes it sound like this is an either
2845400	2847400	or situation. Either
2847400	2849400	you have natural immunity, or you
2849400	2851400	have vaccine immunity, and you can
2851400	2853400	only have one. But this isn't
2853400	2855400	how it works. You can both have caught
2855400	2857400	COVID and gotten vaccinated.
2857400	2859400	And this paper, even if it's
2859400	2861400	right, comes to the conclusion that
2861400	2863400	being vaccinated gives you
2863400	2865400	additional protection. So
2865400	2867400	why didn't Blumenfall tweet
2867400	2869400	bombshell study shows being vaccinated
2869400	2871400	gives additional protection against
2871400	2873400	the Delta variant? Why
2873400	2875400	vax people with natural immunity?
2875400	2877400	Ask Blumenfall and Jimmy Dore. Well,
2877400	2879400	I don't know. How about you actually
2879400	2881400	read the paper that you cite
2881400	2883400	in your video?
2883400	2885400	That might be asking a bit much, though,
2885400	2887400	on YouTube.
2887400	2889400	Thanks a lot for watching today, folks.
2889400	2891400	But before I go,
2891400	2893400	a general disclaimer.
2893400	2895400	Please do not take medical advice
2895400	2897400	from YouTube videos, particularly
2897400	2899400	a ranty comedian's YouTube
2899400	2901400	videos. As a YouTuber
2901400	2903400	myself, I know hundreds of
2903400	2905400	different ways that we can manipulate
2905400	2907400	facts, present biased narratives,
2907400	2909400	and just lie to you
2909400	2911400	and get paid doing it.
2911400	2913400	You don't even have to be that sneaky.
2913400	2915400	99% of your audience will
2915400	2917400	never go and confirm anything you
2917400	2919400	say. You can just lie
2919400	2921400	on here. There are no checks.
2921400	2923400	We are bound to the truth by
2923400	2925400	zero regulations.
2925400	2927400	As long as we don't literally break the
2927400	2929400	law, we can tell you anything
2929400	2931400	we want with zero repercussions.
2931400	2933400	And this goes for me, too,
2933400	2935400	of course. All I can do is
2935400	2937400	relay to you that medical experts
2937400	2939400	and medical institutions overwhelmingly
2939400	2941400	advise vaccination against COVID-19.
2941400	2943400	And I would ask that
2943400	2945400	if you're not vaccinated yet, you go
2945400	2947400	and confirm that information, and
2947400	2949400	so long as you're able, get
2949400	2951400	vaccinated. Jimmy Dore likes
2951400	2953400	to say that everyone will get COVID
2953400	2955400	eventually, and in preparation for
2955400	2957400	that, please get vaccinated.
2957400	2959400	You are much less likely to end up
2959400	2961400	hospitalized, and you are much less likely
2961400	2963400	to end up dead from catching COVID-19
2963400	2965400	if you are vaccinated.
2965400	2967400	It's vastly safer,
2967400	2969400	not just for you personally, but
2969400	2971400	also for anyone you interact with.
2971400	2973400	And for those who don't like needles,
2973400	2975400	I completely understand. I
2975400	2977400	don't like them either, but I've had
2977400	2979400	two COVID-19 jabs so far
2979400	2981400	and I honestly didn't even feel
2981400	2983400	either one of them. And that's
2983400	2985400	not because I'm so tough, by the way.
2985400	2987400	I have a very low threshold
2987400	2989400	for pain. Thank you,
2989400	2991400	as always, to my patrons, who are
2991400	2993400	lovely and should be scrolling by right now.
2993400	2995400	I'll leave a link to my Patreon
2995400	2997400	in the video description if you'd like to check it
2997400	2999400	out. Right, that's all from me today,
2999400	3001400	folks. I'll see you next time.
